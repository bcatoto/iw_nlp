Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes Brad. Uh huh. Oh Brad. Oh!......It's nicer than Betty Munroe had Oh Brad. Now we're engaged and I'm so glad. Oh Brad.  (Both peer up and disappear) That you met Mom And you know Dad. For you. I love you too-oo-oo. Oh Brad, I'm mad. Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all. What's the matter Brad, darling? Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from? What was that bang? Oh... But where will you go?  We're in the  middle of nowhere. I'm coming with you. I'm coming with you. Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back. In the velvet darkness Of the blackest night Burning bright. There's a guiding star No matter what or who you are. There's a light, a light In the darkness of everybody's life Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened. Yes, the rain has been very heavy. You're too kind. Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this? Are you - giving a party? Oh, lucky him. He's lucky. You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky. It's so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you can't see me No not at all. In another dimension. With voyeuristic intention. Well secluded I see all With a bit of a mind flip You're into the time slip Nothing will ever seem the same. You're spaced out on sensation. Like you're under sedation. Oh....Say something. Brad, please lets get out of here. But it seems so unhealthy here. Well I want to leave. Then ask the butler - or someone. This isn't the Junior Chamber of  Commerce Brad. Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared. Right! Oh Brad. It he - Frank - is he your husband? Oh. Weiss. Well, yes I am. Brad... Well.  (She looks at Brad)  I don't  like men with...er, with too many, muscles. But the wrong man. I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an Who's Eddie? His delivery wasn't good enough though. Who is it?  Who's there? Oh, Brad, come in, darling. Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if... Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light. Oh don't be so shy. YOU! You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad? You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never Oh - Oh - no - stop - I mean help. I - Brad - Oh. Brad. Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame. I was saving myself. Promise you won't tell Brad. Oh Brad.  Oh no.  Not till after the wedding, Darling. Maybe we could try it this way. I hope so my darling. No, don't put on the l... What's happening here?  Where's Brad? Where's anybody? I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses. I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry. I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you? If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons. Yes.  There you see it's instinctive. This room is your womb.  You returned here for one thing - security. Oh Brad!  What have they done with him? Ahhh! Oh Brad.  How could you? Oh, but you're hurt.  Did they do this to you? Here, lie down.  I'll dress your wounds. I was feeling done in Couldn't win I'd only ever kissed before I thought there's no use getting Into heavy petting. It only leads to trouble And seat wetting. Now all I want to know Is how to go I've tasted blood And I want more I'll put up no resistance I want to stay the distance I've got an itch to scratch And I need assistance. Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me. I wanna be dirty. Thrill me, chill me, fulfil me. Creature of the night. Then if anything grows (she laughs) While you pose, I'll oil you up And rub you down And that's just one small fraction Of the main attraction You need a friendly hand. Oh, and I need action. Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me. I wanna be dirty. Thrill me, chil me, fulfil me. Creature of the night. I wanna be dirty. Creature of the night. Oh, touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me. I wanna be dirty. Thrill me chill me, fulfil me - oh - Creature of the night. Creature of the ni-i-ight. Creature of the night. Creature of the night.  Oh. Dr Scott! Master, dinner is prepared. Makes you cry Makes you cry Makes you cry My feet - I can' move my feet. We're trapped. It's something you'll Get used to. A mental mind fuck Can be nice. Oh! You mean he's gonna send us to another planet? Sto-o-o-o-o-op. Don't get hot and flustered - Use a bit of mustard. You're a hot dog... When will we return to Transylvania? I grow weary of this world. I ask for nothing, Master. I feel released Bad times deceased My confidence increased Reality is here The game has been disbanded My mind has been expanded It's a gas that Frankie's landed His lust is so sincere. God bless Lilly Saint Cyr. How sentimental. You've killed them. I thought you liked them.  They liked you. Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right... And our World will do the Time Warp again. And super heroes Come to feast To taste the flesh Not yet deceased And al I know Is still the beast
