Captain -- It's really rough here -- Captain -- we're just not built for it -- Do us a favor -- I'd do one for you -- if I could -- Well, get undressed and let's get it over with -- Come on -- cut this crap -- I gotta get back to Saigon -- Yeah. Who are you? Je vais bien maintenant. Yes, they come from the sky. May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat? You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son. Cognac? The war will still be here tomorrow. Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there? Then you are like us. What will you do after the war? What's a big question? Yes. That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz. Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain. Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages? But Captain, I mean -- cannibals. What a pity, you don't drink. Since my husband died, there are so many things I must do alone. Are you warm, Captain? I spend hours watching that river from my bedroom window. It fascinates me. I have been lonely here, Captain. I will fix you breakfast. Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order. You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much. Then Philippe will have to kill all of you. Come in, Captain Willard. Can I get anything for you? Did you know him very well? And you admired him? Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best. You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this... If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was -- I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him... Men looked up to him... He died as he lived... Were you with him, when... What were they? Tell me. Tell me what he said.
