Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me. Was he nice to you? Hi. Want a drink? So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change. Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc... ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out. ...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?But where are you going? Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you. I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell. A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just... ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me... Great! Go back to your files. Bye. Well? Supper at my place? Anything wrong? Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm. Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper? No. Dotty's the last. Another kiss? Kiss, kiss? Do I get a kiss? OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you. Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.Jesus! With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home. OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself. C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny. No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so. Hi. He'll be really mad. He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors. I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK? I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK? Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this. Nick, you're so strange... You say something? I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know. Can I call you at the office?
