C'mon! Tommy? Don't dunk me... 'cause when we bought the house it  was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the  dogs. Do you see the kids? In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' Like you're from N'Yawk. I never hear the whistle. You want to go through those? I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop.   It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity.   Pick out what you want to keep --  it's mostly your city clothes. Don't be silly -ï¿½ You're going to  make summer better for them... Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band- aid. Don't forget these. I think they make you look sexy. Older, sillier. There. What was that? Be careful. Hey Chief. Bring my cup back. This is in no order of importance,  Chief: There's a meeting on the Amity  Town Council on Aging this Monday  night, Bentoncourt Hall. The Fire  Inspector wants you to go over the  fireworks site with him before he  catches the one o'clock ferry. Mainly,  you have a batch of calls about that  new Karate school. Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale,  Tisberry's Hardware... they say it's  those nine-year-olds from the school  practicing karate on all those nice  picket fences. It's the Coroner. Somebody pass away  in the night? What's the matter? Right this minute? Wait-a-minute. Glasses, right? Look at those fences! Little guys  about eight to ten years old. And  look at this! They did that with their bare hands. Hello, Mr. Quint. Yessir, right here. What do those  fish do, eat this stuff? Bye now. And none of them from the Island.  Just a lot of bother. What about this kid? What if he were  born here. That make him an islander? Alex! Alex Kintner! Where do you  think you're going? Let me see your fingers -- They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes  more. Do you want the boys to come in?  Honey, if you're worried... Too cold. I'm going in again Labor  Day. Hope we get this weather next  weekend. You're very tight, y'know? Right there. There's blood in the water. What is it...? Alex! Alex? Alex...! Are you going to close the beaches? That official business could take  all summer! Can you stand something to eat? Mikey loves his birthday present. He's sitting in it. Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty  with a double-knot. It's three feet deep, Martin It's his birthday present, and you  closed the beach, Honey. I told him  not to go in the water after what  happened yesterday. I don't believe  he'll ever do it again. You heard your father! Out right  now! Chief Brody? My Alex was a beautiful little boy  and you killed him. Did you know  that? You knew there was a shark out  there. You knew a girl got killed  here last week. I just found that  out. But you knew. You knew it was  dangerous, but you let people go  swimming anyway. You knew all those  things, and still my boy is dead now  and there's nothing you can do about  that. My boy is dead. I wanted you  to know that. So would I. Come on in. Would you like something? Some coffee? My husband tells me you're in sharks. You love sharks? Excuse me, but what are you talking  about? Didn't they catch the shark  this afternoon? It was on the Cape  station news. Thank you. You're leaving? Is that a boat? Like those Cousteau specials on  television? I think it's for the  kids, but I love them. I saw a show with sea otters, and a  big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made  me promise to get him one. Will you  live on the boat? Martin hates boats. Hates the water.  On the ferry to the mainland, he  sits in the car the whole way over.  He's got this childhood thing, there's  a clinical word for it. Can you do that? ...and with me is the Mayor of Amity,  Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how  about those rumors? Also here today is a Marine Biologist  and Research Fellow from the  Oceanographic Institute, Matthew  Hooper. Mr. Hooper, what've you heard? And there you have it -- two different  opinions, by men of good will. The  holiday crowd here at Amity seems to  be making up its own mind... Amity Island is famed for its clear  air and white sand beaches. But a  cloud appeared... Look at that shine on my nose. It's  a beacon. What else you got? Is there nobody going in? What a  shame. Arthur, should I be going in? This is marvelous! Arthur, I want to  come back to this very spot. Will  you make a note of where we are? The doctor said it's okay -- mild  shock. He can come home in the  morning. Hey, big guy -- you want anything  from home? Home... New York? Did you take your dramamine? Here. Is that him? You going to be all right? I'll see you back soon. There's an  extra pair of glasses in your black  socks, and there's some suntan lotion  and blistex in your kit. What'll I tell the kids?
