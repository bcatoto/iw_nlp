What're you talking about, George? Then what's the problem? Don't you like her? I thought you were in a good mood. No. I don't know, I think... Don't you think there's too much gold? Anyway, you remember Harold? Chicken salad. You're in a good mood today, George.-- think what you have time to think, Lester. Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him. -- is that what this is all about? -- is that right? You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life. We cannot go into this later. -- cause she's going to be very, very expensive. -- I hope you like Miss Shawn -- Lester. I just thought you'd like to know -- That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself. Lester, don't you think that uhh -- That's George. That you were just indulging me. Yes, but... I thought... I don't know. He's a hairdresser. Why? Maybe... why do you ask? Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser. Who? Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See? Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door. And who's Jill? She what? Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her? Right now, I just don't care. No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight. Comb my hair out later, honey. Hello, George. I mean it or I wouldn't say it. And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester. I wouldn't say so if I didn't. I hope she's all right. Is she all right? The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him. Yes. Why don't you see Lester? What about? We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house? What're you doing later? I can see that. I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now. I'm not used to that kind of treatment. George -- -- to be put in that kind of position... -- I like myself far too much, far too much. -- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position. Nummers. I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers... I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead. I don't care. I don't want to talk about it... You're late, George. I don't want to see you anymore. You're very rude... if you don't come back -- So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor. It turned out to be cancer. Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer. Gee, that's very serious... That's very serious. Who's her doctor? Does she have a pancreatic ulcer? What? Why not? Thanks a lot. You mean that girl, don't you? I thought you said you weren't going anywhere. What're you looking for? Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?Shit. God, I adore you. Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you. How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day... No. You know too many sick ladies. Then it's not your problem. Are you? Are you in love with her? Well, is she your girlfriend? Like what? You know what I'm talking about. You're rude. I mean, you're very rude. Want me to? You going to answer it? That headboard. Oh, no.Okay! Call me! Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer. Hi, George. I have to see you. Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all. But Mr. Norman said -- No? -- A wash and set.I don't know -- I've got to. I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am. I can't just let him stand by the door... God, there's Lester... What? What's that supposed to mean? Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him. It's too late... If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that... Well then what are you trying to do- You're going to kill me. That's it, then I'm leaving. Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't -- Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back -- Please, we'll have to talk later -- Lester's on his way. -- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here. -- you've got to leave. -- well you better go after her. Why? -- we are? What's wrong? Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man? Me? -- ass and legs -- -- but you never were much of a tit man -- -- very nice, very nice. Nothing. -- oh I thought you were -- -- well, if you feel like playing, go play... We're friends. -- look, you don't have to entertain me... The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it? He still having parties? Where do you want to go? I am you, you little bastard. You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I? You don't think so? I do. No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester. I don't know what gets into me. -- gee... Fuckin' A -- Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon -- -- don't you want to -- -- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you -- -- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me. He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something. That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth -- We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much. What about it? He's a director. -- what guy? -- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green... Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic? What are you talking about? Don't, don't, don't... It'll ruin everything. No! Don't! Please! You're a genius. George... You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you? You did, I know you did. You did, didn't you? Well, did you or didn't you? Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight. You know what I'm talking about. Did you? George... how about Felicia? If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you. George... There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something. Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something... No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it. It was after you, baby. After you. And what? ... he tried to... uh... make it with me. No. Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men. The shrink? Many times. Not too much, don't cut too much. It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot. What's wrong? ... I don't get it done often. She's incredible... She loves you, George. Jill's coming with us. Okay... but I want you to know one thing. I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay? You don't seem very sure. You would? Well, what do you think? Can't you do it out here? Where do you want to do this? Well, I do. Shut up, it's all right. Do you want a drink? -- What for? Honey, I'll see you later. -- Well no. It never came up. He's a very private person, actually. Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet. Jill's really great, isn't she? -- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you? Jesus... So how's Norman? -- well, more than anything else -- -- I'd like to suck his cock. You do? Sid. You must be a very important executive. That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth. -- you phony asshole -- Jackie Shawn. You know what's wrong. I don't know. Why don't you ask him? Jesus, she's my best friend. Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say. Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope. Because I don't want one. No. Here. They're Yorkies and they don't shed. Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house. Shut the door, shut the door! Fine. You're still jealous. You're lying about one thing, Lester. You and your touchy investors. Really? How about starting with tonight? That's not very logical, Lester. So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf! I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to. I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him. Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy. Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy. Steve? Who do you think I was talking to? I am? No kidding? Your own shop? I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much. Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser. Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met. The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it. Anyway, you're crazy. Fine. That's right. Poster-Kleiser. Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along? Hi, Leonard. No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything. Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was. -- He reached up and tore them. -- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there... -- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs... -- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show... Well, there was this one time -- -- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all. -- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping? What? I would say so, yes. It's been so long I don't how long? He does? What? How much? After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do. Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day? Five times a day? -- Yeah, honey... We don't think marriage is important. I thought you said things were great with George. It must be something. Well, what is it, honey? You're really a love -- you sure? Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are. You're sure you don't mind? Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side. I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you? Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful. Well, he is. No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser. Oh, honey, don't be totally naive. A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years. I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.I said you were a loser! George... George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream. Yes, yes, I did. Stop it. George, now cut this out. Please!... that's not like you. George... -- yes. I wish you'd go now. ... honest. At least you're honest with me. ... well I'm glad you told me. I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually. -- no, it'll help me, really -- -- it'll help me if you'll tell me. I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know! I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing... I just want to know, that's all. How many? Obviously there were others, weren't there? So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh? Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed. -- and take this with you. I'd like you to leave now. Yes. Yes. Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police. Let go of me. I'm very tired, George. What is. I didn't want him meeting me here. Bullshit. I don't want to fight, George. -- what? -- I'll see you later... -- go ahead. -- she's a very compulsive girl. Commercials. Ha, ha. Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here. I know, honey. I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair. I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight? What business meeting? Never mind. Where've you been? A friend dropped me off. ... Okay... What? But I never know when you're working and when you're not working! When is that, George? When is that? When? Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know. I want your feelings about it. Your advice! No, but I think they might. Egypt. Whether or not I'm going. I know but this is important. I have to make a decision. When can I talk to you? George. I already said hello. George. Okay, but how did it go at the bank? Egypt! I said I wasn't sure if I could go. Could I? Could I talk to you for a second? How did it go at the bank? Hello. They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks. George. Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated. Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually... George? Yeah. You've never even been around one. Maybe you don't even like children. But in the same house, you know, one house. Will we live together? Why am I great? Honey? Do you really mean that? I am? I am? What about me? I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life. Honey, what happened? How? What? Fine. How are you? Now, George -- George -- George, I don't -- I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream. I just... who what? They're dumb, somebody... I don't know... I've had these dumb dreams lately. I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me. I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen. Let me come, too. Please don't leave me alone. Here in the canyon. Gunshots, there were some gunshots. There were some shots. Somebody's mother. I was too old. A daytime soap opera. Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day. No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time? What did you do? Didn't you have any panties on? ... Mmm-hmmm. -- uhh-huhh... -- Yesss? C'mon. -- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have. -- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he? I think you're going to hit that car in front of us. Honey? Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It? Well yes -- you know that about George. Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time. Jackie -- I'm exaggerating. Well, you know what I mean. -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop. I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy. But you have problems? Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you? Well, it's George. Nothing. -- No. No really. Don't be silly. I guess not. George is great but I know what you mean. I know, I'm sorry. So what's your point? I'm not. Maybe I am. I am? I mean why? Who is that? -- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon. We can't really leave that poor man here alone. Johnny! Why didn't you tell me before? You're kidding. You're going? Now I didn't mean that, you rat. -- so when are you going to Egypt? Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind? -- why? Let's do that. -- Jackie really shouldn't drink -- That bastard. Well did he go in there with Jackie? George? Was he alone? Well... sure... Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party? He's a hairdresser. -- no. -- never mind. Johnny! Sort of. Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend. Well he's not exactly a friend. ... my friend doesn't like it here either. Why don't you ask for another one? Oh. thank you. Now I'm embarrassed to tell you. But why Egypt? Egypt? Thank you. -- yes, Jill. Jill. -- there's not much room -- -- I'll get in the back -- Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon. -- his car. They have it blocked. Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go. No! No. No. No. No, it's not that... No... how long did you say?I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now... I'm not kidding. No you won't. I'm coming over. You're home.Yeah. Yeah. I am not! I am not! I am not like my mother! Then what do you think? Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too? You live a phony cheap cop-out existence. You think that's funny, don't you? In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life. I never get my hair done. You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it? Don't make conversation with me. Why? Making it with my mother? Well, are you? I asked you first. Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy? See if you've been making it with my mother. C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid. C'mon, are you or aren't you? Well, are you? Are you queer? Did you hear me? Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good. Chopped liver? You're my mother's hairdresser? This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox? Hungry? She's out, but you're supposed to wait. You here to see my mother?-- took a bus. -- left my bag, didn't have no money... -- you know better... -- you shouldn't do me like that... -- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better... Otis is dead. That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due? -- Oh my yes. But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either. -- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George. What with? Yeah!Come on by. Awww -- All right, who're you with? Jill? What took you so long?
