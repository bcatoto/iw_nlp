How I make my living, what's your point? No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go. But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited. Oh, yeah? Who are you?So Max, what do you do with all your money? Am I? I'll make it worth your while. I shouldn't do this. But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power. Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me. I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it. Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times. What're you looking for? Same old story. Not interested. Must think you're pretty special laying this on you. Where'd you clip this?Move it. No. Leave. Now. You know each other? Some of us are trying to sleep. You didn't... What's with you? Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family. What a creep. Yech... Thanks, it's starting to kick in. I feel almost human.Hello... What else can we do? If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay? Can you help me get her back? I couldn't get to her. It all happened so fast. Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run. And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want. If I run, maybe they'll come after me. Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran... They took my daughter. Oh my God! In here! IN HERE! There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright. Soon, baby. Don't worry, I'm coming to get you. Sophy? Are you okay? Pretty much the same reasons I was crying. But things will be better when we move to a new place. What makes you cry? No... Because we can't. There's nothing here for us anymore. I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends-- Goodnight Bears. Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens. Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks. And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house. And goodnight--I understand. Okay, okay. Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help... Let go of my hand. Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch. I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend. Not him, and certainly not you. Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are. You're also a fool. How sweet. Standing by your man, even after what he did. You're a very understanding person. Oh? I thought it was important for you to know the facts. He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately? That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back. Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting. He didn't either...at first. With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship. My name's Lydia. And it seems you and I have a lot in common. To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late. A friend of your fiance's.And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt. She was there... 'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend? Who would take offense to that? You mean until you showed up? I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain. Only one I can think of. So are dogs. Please... Friends don't help other friends cheat. Unlikely. You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out. Where? More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious... And back at ya. Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know-- Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right? How long you and me known each other? You know what I'm saying. Hell yeah. There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying. You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little... He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut. You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense. What? You're way more philosophical than I could ever be. Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him. Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do? Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that? Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there-- No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying? Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike. Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes. So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.You get it when I get her. She's got my word. Make the call. And she bought that? So, how do you get the woman to come to me? Pull the cash. Who are you? I actually know how this works. Quite a mouth on a girl so young... ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best. Not right now? Okay, when? I'll bet you can. Sit.Mommy, I'm scared. When? Mommy, where are you? Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad. If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me. Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying? Are we in some kind of trouble? But why can't we stay here? I don't want to move away.I will. So long, Bobo. Well, you can tell them I said they're right. I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am. You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller. Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big. A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo? Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice. He's a good kid. A salesman. Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez. Oh, thanks, Bobo. Permanent damage. It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh... You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies. You mean, the insurance frammis? No. You're calling the shots. It'll never happen again. I swear. I never fucked up before, Bobo. He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick. My son was in the hospital -- My son -- Bobo, no, I -- I want to keep my teeth. I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those-- I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo. Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for. Hi, Bobo. And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call. Fine. Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there? Do you have something around back, facing away from the road? I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night. Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight. Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house. I like you, too. Roy? He's always crying. My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed. You know who I work for. Well, make it stop! What? He's going to be all right! Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way. I know. Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here. Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at -- I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it? Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related? ) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power. A future. The only future I've got. And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game. Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different. Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him. If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age? That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know. You're getting off the grift? I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money. And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy. No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up. I wonder did you ever think about it from my side. A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was. Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid. I know what's bugging you, of course. You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live. I'll get it. No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water? You want a drink? And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this. Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive. Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo -- What? Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there. A job? I've never had a legit job in my life! At what? Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that? Just a few bucks. I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead. I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but -- It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and -- I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain? As though you do what I say. No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me? She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash? Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure. Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check. I've really got to -- Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding? Somewhere else, that's for sure. Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down. It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know. You, too, Roy. After the meet. Back to Baltimore. I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another. No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air. No. That was the point. You do? Roy, I don't want money from you. What's that? If you come out to the track, don't know me. Roy! What are you doing in San Diego? I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you. You don't have the stomach for it. Get off the grift, Roy. You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy? He let me live. He let me be his friend. I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me. It didn't. That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out. The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be. My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down. No. And you have to be. That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you -- You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book! And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls! Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that? Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called. Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh? Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them. You always did. Don't mention it. Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track. I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks. Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son. Only one tooth? Only one arm? So what's your story today?Where's the five? You're too young. You should be in school. Scram. Go home. I didn't teach you that.Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you? It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation. Cole, it'll be all right. Honey? Henry, no! We're not really interested, Henry. Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring. So here we are! Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has-- -- you don't mind my telling him, darling -- -- suffered reverses. If he could... Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing -- Goody! Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything. Wouldn't I, darling? Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients! You are seeing it. You're looking right at it. I have only one thing now. Are you interested? It's not your fault. All right. It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all? But they must be! They cut glass! What is? But what's wrong? Why? What's wrong? We'll work something out, Joe. I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten? Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink? Joe, you know you'll -- Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more -- You heard the shower, didn't you? I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like -- Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh? Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other. By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly. What is it? What's going on? Bullshit! For Christ's sake, why not? What? No! Because I -- You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day. But the setup's there. It's there now. What? I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position -- You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds. But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back? You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy. I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us. I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is. I saw her. I went out to Delmar. ) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah! Open it and find out. Open your door. You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out. Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over. Think about it. Okay? Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand? I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole. Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... Atascadero. Upstate. He retired. Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year. No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off. No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole. He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker! He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark. It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game. It was beautiful. And getting better all the time. I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley. The long end. Big con. Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square. You're on the grift. Same as me. The tap. What you do for a living. Oh, come on, Roy. I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys. You already went back to work. I'll sign that affidavit. No. Big spender. What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there? I don't see why we have to take the train. I'll see you when you get home. Get well soon. You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth. And you never defend me. You're afraid of her. I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks. Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you. You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you. I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me. I want to know everything about you. Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you. You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had? No, baby. Come to Mama. I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material. No more than this? Roy? It this all we have? Look at me. Roy? Are you sure? You aren't taking me for granted, are you? Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?Well, how do I look? What do you want? You want to see me? Well, here I am. Hiya Jake. That was some dance. It's fun. Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.LET GO! Daddy. Let go. You're hurting me! Daddy!It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead. Short? It's ended. You know, you got a strange line here. You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split. You have an unusual hand.You know who I am. How many times have you asked me that? How many times? I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise. A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up. What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote? Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer. Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished. It's over, Jake. It's all over. Sit down! Sit down, Jake. Do what? I haven't done a thing. I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack. Where's West? New Jersey? Oh? Where you going? Oh yeah? What was happenin' there? I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage. Where'd you go today? You can have anything you want. Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost. You look terrible. What happened? Jake ... is it the antidote? Jake, what is it? You look upset. What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street. Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right? You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing! You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you. What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy? You've lived with me for two years. Cause you know goddamn well who I am. It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now. So tell me ... am I still an angel? YOU KNOW WHO I AM. How many times have you asked me that? How many times? You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have! What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote? Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer. Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished. It's over, Jake. It's all over. Sit down. Sit down, Jake. Oh yeah? Try leavin' without me. Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry. Please. Bullshit! I can waitress. I'm good. I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go. This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen. It's so hard to believe. It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next. What's gotten into you? God, I can't keep up with all your changes. Are you out of your mind? What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this? Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do. How do you know he's telling the truth? How? Who was that? Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what? Vietnam? ... What experiments? It might be for me. Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that. I want to know. You tell me! Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called? Who else were you expecting? It's just me. Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight. Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something. I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said. He said you didn't have one. He didn't give me a chance. Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case. While you were in the shower. I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called. How come? The army? Remember that. I know. We're all angels, you know ... ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see. So tell me ... am I still an angel? Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind. Love me a little? You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time. Hello! Anybody home? Anybody in there? You're right here, Jake. You just rest. The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate. Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up. You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil. What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh? Jake. You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine. Here. I'll do it. Sam, Tony, come in here. Lie down! What kind of man are you? You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice. That's your decision. Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting. He's coming right over. That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub. Get your clothes off! Get your clothes off. The numbers stop at 107. It's gone to the top. I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor. Can't you stop it? Hey, I'm here. Why? What for? What do you mean? Where do you think? We're at Della's. Oh, come on. It's early. You okay? Come on. What were they, Jake? Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time. Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not. It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is. New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed. It's still there, Jake. Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ... It has nothin' to do with talkin'. 'Cause she's always on your mind. Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife. I enjoy crushing into you. Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it. Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it. What's wrong? Jake! Just gettin' rid of the garbage. I don't like things that make you cry. Is that the one who died? Not to me. Look at her face. A real bitch. Why you left. That's Sarah? I can see what you mean. Lemme see. Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school. Jake, you are never out of your head! The best. A good lay. You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me. I don't let anybody call me that. Well, personally, I never went for church names. They're weird names. No. The little one. Your kid dropped it off. Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom. Did you look around the headboard? Where'd you leave 'em? You up? What happened to you? It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late? The room! What do you think? That help? I moved the couch. That's all. Where are you? Gee, thanks a lot. Why didn't you turn on the light? Jake, is that you? He's melting it as fast as we dump it in. Pour it in. He doesn't like it. Bring it in.Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy. On top of him? I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice? Is he all right? I have some ice from the machine.Of course it is. What else could it be? I'm sorry. No. No. You haven't had any visitors. You look awake to me. Here. Drink some of this. Lennox Hospital. Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it? We're doing everything we can. I'll page him.Jacob, what can I do? No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time. I thought you said it was a nightmare? Go to sleep. Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind? I don't want to know. It's not healthy with it closed. I'm not cold. What was that?If you're lucky. Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask? Two hundred dollars a night, for what? Hot. Where do I sign? That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired. I know. That's why I'm asking. How 'bout over there? No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room. I no from around here.Doug, don't! Nooo! I would never do anything to hurt you. I want you to come back to me. I love you. I'm here at Rekall. Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you? After all we've been through? It's time you found out. You sure you don't wanna...? For old time's sake. If you don't trust me, you can tie me up. But Doug...There's something I want you to know. You're the best assignment I ever hand. Really. Beats me. I just work here. The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up. Implanted. It was implanted by the Agency. I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago! Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh! I'm not your wife. Doug... Doug, nobody tried to kill you. Oh God, Doug. What did they do to you? Tell me! You went to those brain butchers?! Mars? You've never even been to Mars. Take it easy. Tell me exactly what happened? Why would "spies" want to kill you? Muggers?! Doug, are you all right? What happened? What are you doing? You are somebody. You're the man I love. Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here. Okay? Well...What do you say? There's lots nicer places than Mars. Doug, maybe we should take a trip. And you believe him? Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times. You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring! --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute. Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning. Do what? Yeah, sweetheart? ...You mean it? Let me go! It's not funny, Doug. You dream about her every night. Tell me! Nobody?! What's her name? Who is she? The brunette. The one you told me about. Poor baby. This is getting to be an obsession. Is that better?How could you do this? You're a mutant. But maybe you can change all that. Shut up and drive! The Last Resort! Quick! Then kiss me quick...before you wake up. What's wrong? Enough for everybody to breathe? Of course not. If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control. You sure about this? Aliens?! Where's this "reactor" come from? People are dying, Quaid!! Stop!! We've got to get air!! What reactor?! Where are you going?! I'm not sure dear? What do you think? You two-faced-bastard. Oh, since when? All sorts of things. You might even remember you loved me. Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser. The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks. I'm not a hooker! That's my cover. I used to model for 'em, why? Jump! Kuato wants to see you. Come on! If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay. I said get out! Get out! I'm not falling for it. I think you better leave. You never loved me, Hauser! You just used me to get inside. Because you're still working for Cohaagen. No. Let's forget everything! I've had it with you and your goddamn lies. Oh, she isn't really your wife. How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife. Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!? This is too weird. Hauser, you're lost your mind. Hauser? You're Hauser. What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here? What are you talking about? ...What? You couldn't get me a message? You never wondered what happened to me? I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death! I think it's still hungry. Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing? I love you.I'd go for penetration. The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway. Knock it off, Burt! You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun. I can't believe it. No tracks, no sign, no spoor. Phone's out. Road's out. We're on our own. Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck... We're here, Val. Just tell us what you need. Come back. Yeah, Val. Down, honey, down. Hi, guys, what you been up to?Come on. Get away from it! You sure this is where it was? Well, what's wrong with it? That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done. Just keep looking at that beautiful sky. We have to go into Bixby in the morning. The concrete blocks are in.Well, yeah! There's going to be major research up here. First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up. You're really leaving, huh? Hi, guys. Burt loaned me his camera. Nope, there! That's one. Could we make it to the mountains? We're not going over there, right? VAL, STOP! THEY'RE COMING! DON'T MOVE! Oh my God. Well, we can take my truck then. The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to. Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry. Well, I was wondering if we could... I might have an idea... There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record... That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now. Right. Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface. Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find me . This is important, you know. This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century. The century? Forget it. History . I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles... Thanks. God, I hope they're not screwed up. I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you. It worked! There they go! Wait! How are you going to know they're all following it? Listen, they only respond to vibration, right? Couldn't we... distract them somehow? Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be some way! You guys do all the odd jobs. Yeah, they're confused. They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us. Why do you all keep asking me? It does. Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials... ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor. But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains. Ready? Let's assume that it is. Yeah. But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it. Darn it! Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes." every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings. I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this. Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs. You know, they measure vibrations... Listen, got a question for you. Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that? Right, geology. And you have to be Val and Earl. I've heard all about you. Hi, I'm Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany. Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out. Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are. Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize. Why? He's right in the groove. Fuck me. No way... GET OUT!!! Get out. You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure. Well... Yeah - okay. No, he's out changin' the oil in the car. Twenty. What's Cao Ben? Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all. Why, honey? Thinkin' a second, baby. Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute. And? Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace? Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine. Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight? Nothin', honey. Mama's just actin' strange. Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do. Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo. SAILOR!!!! How can you say that, Sailor? What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there. Really, Sail, I'll be okay. I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit. You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet. Shake hands with your daddy. That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to. Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most. Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben? He's the kind liked it. That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too. He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't. Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor? Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna. I mean tomorrow. Let's leave here. Sail? So where'd you say you was? Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend. Yeah... He was lookin' for you. Buddy and Sparky come by earlier. Can't tell yet. Where'd you go? You been drinkin', huh? I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me. Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you. Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me. Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it. Sailor? You know what? No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down. Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed. Come sit by me. A little, I think... Darlin'? I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up. You find any work? That you, Sail, honey? I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired. This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life. Sailor? Now what? And no AC. No radio or TV... Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet. She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor? I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes... You think she's gonna make it? Sailor, what are we gonna do? SAILOR!!! Oh God, Sailor. What's that? I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before. If you say so. Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we? I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together. My mama... So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined. ...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals. That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos... No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too... Yeah, I'm here. How'd you know my daddy? That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor. God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died. Oh shit... You knew my daddy? You're scarin' me, baby. I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool... Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar? The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither. I can't take no more of this radio... I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!! You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest. You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work? How much we got left, honey? Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel? It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you. Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use? I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay. Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now. You think she's pretty? Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that? You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself? I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good? We'll find out in a hurry. Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone. I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you? Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay? I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies! Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us. He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us? You think he saw us? Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor. Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'! Who do? Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo... Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half. Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what. Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay. What was this one? You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey? Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed. I really do think it's the best night of my life. I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life. Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that? You certain? Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days? Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one. Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill? One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it. It's just another case, Sailor. I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me. We sure don't, honey... Get me a Mounds? Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject. Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it! Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose? I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it. Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech? Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes? M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O. It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time. What's that, honey? I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt. How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel. Got anyplace special in mind? That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet? What kinda trash talk is that? Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world? Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate. Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you. It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape? We got through two states already. What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there. I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then? I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary. Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have? You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do? You mean like pedal pushers? Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are! What'd you say to her? Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'? You still got plenty energy for me, baby. ...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy. I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would. Sailor! Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much... We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor. Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference. He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald. When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair. Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell? The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since. It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit. ...are followin' him around. One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen. One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus? Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear. Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin' a hard lesson. What I learned from observin' Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He'd startin' behavin' weird? Like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'? Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago. It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers. ...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South. She got me an abortion... I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner. Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice. Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives? Sailor? That don't seem fair. Don't the reject guys get anythin'? I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years. What's that honey? What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book. What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain. Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all. I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one? That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch... Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray. Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space... One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal. Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry? Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich. He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed. No, he picked me up. Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter. Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house. I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it. You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know? That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little. Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it. Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white? Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces. You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died? I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything. Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it. What brand'd she smoke? Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer. Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone? 'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane." Hey baby... HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!! Damn! I'll bet. Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots. Wouldn't make any difference. Really, mama, I gotta go. Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama. Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'. Six. Course I am, mama. I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go. Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him. Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself. I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go. I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it? Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now. No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina! Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that? Just a place. Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too. If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am. I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry. Like hell. Mama???You won't of missed much. I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs. This 'bout the fifth time? Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail. Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar! Who?... Uncle Pooch?... Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you. I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late. Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids. What is it, Johnnie? I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number? Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it. No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport. I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then. Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me... Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad... No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift. Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city. I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m. This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms. Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby! Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer. Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta? You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me. I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos. Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss. I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie. What if I told you not to? What if I asked you not to? Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me. Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula. Got any plans? What time's Sailor's train get in? You ain't takin' Pace, though. You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport. Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone. Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right. No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are. Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care. Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans? Really, Lula, this ain't right! You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you. Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here. Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy? You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story. And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer. Oh God! What does that mean? HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around. I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it. Please Santos... Where's Johnnie? Where we goin'? Santos... What's happenin' here? Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie? No... Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me. Someone's gonna see us. What? You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you. Santos... I can't... No... But... Santos... No... Please, Santos... Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town. See! I knew you had it all under control. Yes. Yes. No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has. Yes. In the head. No. Yes. Shoot him. Santos... NO... For God's sakes, Santos! That's your business... I don't care how. All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that. I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well. Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game? Yes... Get rid of him. I want you to get rid of Sailor. What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason. Yes. I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again. Lula's gone off with Sailor. Santos... It isn't. That's not why I called. Oh, don't worry 'bout that... So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets. Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos... No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom... Well, she wants to fuck you. Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?... ...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again. There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow? No, of course. Used to. That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im. Juana called. They're stayin' another week. Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good. You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass? Nice of you to drop by. I ain't heard of nothin'. I know... I remember. Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it... Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy? Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?... Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to? You really are one dumb asshole. Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter. By who? Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime... Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?Art Mo-o-o-ney! That was close... We invested in these factories. In Vancouver. Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex. Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved... Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache... Did she tell you anything? Zuzu Petals! Did she have it? I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford. You suck. Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me. I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow. I'll do my best. Nonsense. After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you. So you... So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself. Uh, let's go sit down. My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon. Who? I have no answers. Thanks for the stain. Find the girl. In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler. We'll chat again, then. Actually, you may take it all now. Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree. Excuse me? But how did you know? Here, take this picture... I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu... I don't have a sense of humor, either. Sorry. Fag? Ass? I'm sorry, is that a joke? Who's your decorator? Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich. The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me. When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you? Please. Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help. I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry. What is it they call you? Mr. Rock and...Wha -- I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry. I'm quitting. I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel. C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel label. Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver. Johnny's C.D.? Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits. This one is putting out low bits. The data is in some fucked binary system. The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc. Comprendo? You're not funny. I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet. What were your words... 'A fucking C.D. This case is closed.' I came to warn you... Hello, Ford... Ah, an obvious choice. Who? You okay? Hello... It's Colleen. With answers. She wants to meet. Down. Way down-town. Late. She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure... Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl. Period. Contacts. Celebrate? Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders? Forget it, man. Make eye contact when you say that. No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in? I mean, she is what this case is about. You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands... Shut up, goodies from the ice queen. Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm. Go on, 'they're stahting.' You're a fucking gentleman. What do you want from me? Spooky. I'll process her. I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity. Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet? So what about this watch? That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky... You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks. I'm, I'm shocked. Quit crying. I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here... You're saying you need money. Let's just declare war on the hellhole. Before they make Crocodile Dundee three. G'day, they say it's worth three grand... 'Bye Ford...' Hey, let me cheer you up. I found the IN X S payment. You wish. Exactly. Assistant. And don't call me Jazz.This isn't music! Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about. Hi, private eye guy! You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right? Do you suspect foul play and stuff? That's cute. You're funny. Do you really know everybody in the industry? You're that guy, the private eye.Yeah, Ford. I'm okay. Hoh graphic! I'm going to dream of ears for a year! Ugh! You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s... Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star. There's that question... Hello, Mr. Tongue! What a perv. Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy. Kill! Kill! Kill! Let go of the belt! What are you doing? You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy. Ick. Smooth. I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny. Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh? Suck a dick, I left my purse... This way... Nice left you got there, jerk. But you know, that was just a dream. Doesn't really count. Ford, you were right! This is boring, guys. I know the feeling. This must be hell. Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo. Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave? Okay? I just blew up. I feel orgasmic. Hah fluck, great video, huh? Who cares about people? Let's watch some 'M.T.V.' What a perv... Why are you depressed? You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover... You didn't ask. Have you ever thought about mousse? Yeah, it's weird. Bobby and Johnny were such good friends... No. Who's Art Mooney? Come again? B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A. Because I know rock-n-roll. Spunk, come back... It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit! Mr. Bus Driver, stop! I dunno. He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so. Ever since he died, I've been chased... Omigod ! I'm so sure! I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and... Why are all these people after me? Peachy. Hello? It's red, Ford. Fluck you! I don't know. I'm so scared. Help me.But he was always a bad kid, that one. What? What happened? You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.I don't care. I need my hat. I won't go without it. I gotta go home and get my hat. I gotta go home. Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do! Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Where'd you find such creeps?What about the schools? I got scared. I got seared. Oh no! No! Noooo! They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear. What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house. I flushed it down the toilet. What are you talking about? Who's gonna do that? Then you're safer in here. I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him. At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest. Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent. She's beautiful. Look at her. Henry, look at her. But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz. With what? I don't want to hear about her anymore. I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out. I can't do it anymore. Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him. He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare. Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke. I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me? Let her carry this shit inside. You want her to visit you? Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board. Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register. You son of a bitch. She's been here. I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman. He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house. I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning? The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win? Henry. Wake up. I don't care. Something's going on. I'm gonna need some money. I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband -- The bag with the envelopes. My bag. My bag. What are you gonna do? They don't feel like you're in construction. What do you do? What're you doing? What about the car? Talk? To you? After what you did! Liar! Have more coffee. It'll wake you up. Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty. He says he's too hot. He doesn't even know I came here today. It's like he's crazy. Jimmy. Jimmy. I don't know. I got so much else on my mind. I got the kids. We got no money. He's okay. They sobered him up. Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all. Ma! Stop! What do you want me to do? Ma! Please! You're driving me crazy. Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here. He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes. He's with his friends. That's important. I don't want them left back. I got dry cleaning.Do? What can you do? What did you expect? He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live? Your father would never stay out this late without calling. In thirty years he never stayed out all night. Driving you crazy? Don't get me started. You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these? He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves? Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar. If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment. What kind of person doesn't call? He didn't call?But I got two hundred and fifty coming. It's my share. Jimmy owes me. I want to talk to Jimmy. And Jimmy's in it, right? It's a fait accompli? I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way... But you didn't even taste your cocoa. I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else. How does a nice cup of cocoa sound? Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink? I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think. It's right this way. God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it? I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection... ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please. What do you want to know? Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you? Oh, my! Did I do good? Ahh!!! Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right? Yes, Paul. I was fooling, silly. You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne. Dome Pear-igg-non. What things? Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me. Paul, this will be our legacy. It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?-- --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place. Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful. This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right? The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past? Oh, Paul. It's beautiful. But the time is now. Soon others will come. That's disgusting. I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer-- Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me? Don't talk to me like that. Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week. Now don't fuss, Paul. Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south. You've been out of your room. Paul, I know you've been out. That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true. The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave. When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian. I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me. The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues. Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written. Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one. Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery? Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do? You really think so? Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years. Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look. To Misery. A toast? My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef. Oh... I hope you like it. Oh, Paul. It would be an honor. I'm going to play my records all day Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records-- --you do like Liberace, don't you? Not even a hint? Will she still love him with that special perfect love? Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s. Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...? I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right! You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma-- What? You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you. The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta." You can--you have the "gotta"-- Don't be silly. Of course you can. What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word. But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there. "HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!" I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know. Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered-- --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--" That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays... Paul, what you've written just isn't fair. Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in. I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again. Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration. Here, in case you think of any ideas. It'll only take a second. Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you. Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing? What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man. Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you. Thank you for thinking of me. Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers? Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating? But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge. You--fooler...! Did I do good? And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name. Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work. I expect nothing less than your masterpiece. Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it. Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world... I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right. Oh, but Paul! I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at-- --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return. That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work. Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up. And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now. See, isn't this nice? Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. How does tuna casserole sound for dinner? I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think? As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul. Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values. I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago. So you've indicated. Do it. Then light the match, Paul. I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best. Yes. Yes. But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way." I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver. You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do. What are you doing on the floor? It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in. I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy? She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery. Then who did? I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her! You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you? Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me. I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens. It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment. Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again. No problem. Done? I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again. I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems. 'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too. For a while I thought I might go crazy. Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world... I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted? This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me-- But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so. Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan. I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery. Thank you so much. I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that? I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that. No. No, it isn't, it's-- --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting? I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75. Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself. ...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend. Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours. Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning. What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain... The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you. They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. It has no nobility. The swearing, Paul. There, I said it. Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant. Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you? Nothing. Oh, like I could do that? What's it about? What's your new book called? You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me. If you wouldn't mind. It shouldn't be too much longer. Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you. Could I ask you a favor? I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and... and I wondered if maybe... And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain. Like a baby. All done. Lucky for you, I did. Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels... Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck-- Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming. Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin-- and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer. No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you. Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there. But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better. Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they? It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you. The blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down. They're called Novril--they're for your pain. Here. You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay. My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm-- Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now. I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him. No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door. Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.I appreciate that. Thanks a lot. I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly. No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him... Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange? I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books. Yes, he is. Yes. I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble. I thought you were over it. Now you've hurt me, Paul. Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house. I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously. And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes. The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter. Here it is. Very first copy. Did they win? I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study. No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her. Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million. You're still a writer. It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.It's good you found it. What is it? What thing? Oh, I like that tone. That's nice. What? What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm? Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot. It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever. You don't think he's dead, do you? Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek. Any calls? You really think Sheldon's out there? Could be the weight of the snow. What? What is it? Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff. Four or five days ago. Why? We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.They never are, dear. Your uncle will like this. Philip! We'll need shoes! You'll want a cocktail dress then. Turn. You have a beautiful figure. A little too out in the open but simply lovely. Size six? Do you need shoes? No wonder. For starts, you should know that hot pants are horrid , even when you do have the legs to carry them off. What are your plans while you're in town?I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe. Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day. No. You took care of rent, that's enough. Yeah. Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy. And leave all this? Not in a million. Do I!? Momma! So did I. I made it with the principal. Study hard And get a "B." Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see. What kind of school? So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco? Wow, are you in deep shit. You know he'll break your heart. Go for the bucks. I pray for that. Dummy. Oh, my god, you mean it was good? Honey, you're not supposed to do that. Where do you fit? What do you know? You look good . All dressed up. You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do. Not that you ever did anyway. Everybody keeps starin' at me. Yeah. I just got it. Carlos. I still owe him two hundred bucks... Was that you? Baby! Rodeo Drive. In Beverly Hills? I'm getting dressed now. I'll be over. Bye. I'm sorry, Viv'. Carlos has been on my back. Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'? Why'd he want you? I was asleep. You woke me. You okay? 'Lo. Hey, hey -- There's a rent. I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home. Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and -- Okay. I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid. I will. I'm trying. Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high? Don't be mad at me. I'll pay you back. I promise. Viv... don't be stupid. We're whores. Carlos had some great rock. Hi, Viv. Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.No, I'm sorry, I don't. Yes? Would you like to try it on? I don't think we have anything for you here. You're obviously in the wrong place. Excuse me? It's very expensive. I don't think it would fit you. Yes... Are you looking for something in particular? May I help you?He's not really my uncle. I dunno. Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress? Well... I might be going out to dinner. Georgia. You don't know anything about me. It's... it's not like that. No. Please, we hardly know each other. Huh? Oh... yeah. S'okay? Uhm... how're... business things going. It's not your fault. You're right. Kit's right. But I want the fairy tale. I didn't think so. I do. I do want to. That's why I'm leaving. That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now. I want a guy like you for real. Not because you buy me things and give me money. The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that? Aw, don't... no... I'm leaving. Don't ya see? If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to. What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No. I'll take my money now, please. It was good. Right. You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'? I heard what you did with Kross. Why do guys always know how to hit a woman? Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode. What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off! It's all just business to you. Him. Me. Your life. Everything's business. Business. Right. Last time I saw him he was this strong guy. Now he's beaten. And you liked him . What did you do to him? You just did. I know. Hey, don't mind me. I'm being stupid. I'll think about it, okay? It's a real good offer for a whore. When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen. Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo." I'm sorry. That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it... What else? You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town? Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take. Did you? I more than liked it. But don't they have it in English? If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying? You mean, besides Elvis? I'm a human being. Sure. Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy. He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago. They stopped at a gas station. He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other. Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time. He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things. The two of us getting married someday. Having kids. Stupid stuff. Sorry. You're not paying me to ask you question like that. I've never been on a plane before. Huh? Where are you taking me!? What if someone tries to steal it? What if I lose it? Edward, I can't. What's that? Do I look okay? I'm not hurt. It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off. Fuck off. Pay me! Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in. Well, it's true. Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone. Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money. I want my fucking money. I'm getting out of here. I don't want anything more to do with you. Stuckey! He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave. You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own? I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight. Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?! What are you trying to prove!? I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends! You asshole! I can't believe what a --! I thought I was the pro. These women make me feel like an amateur. Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with. They're just into it for the money. You could freeze ice on his wife's ass. She anything like your ex? Real genuine guy. You did. What id we run into someone I know? You're really pushing it, bringing me here. You still mad at'm? Keep talkin'. I like hearin'. Seems like it. I guess it's easy to get used to, huh? You always been rich? What about dinner? Wait till you see what I have on underneath. I thought maybe you'd like dinner. Come with me? Okay. I had a little problem in one store. I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say. I don't belong there. Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget. She was cool. Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you? It works. I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be. Uh-uh. No work. Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound. You don't have to use your brain at all. Know what we're gonna do in a little while then? We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza. We're gonna eat it in bed. We're gonna veg' out and watch television. We're the exactly the same! Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it. Except with you. At your price I give my all... You liked the guy, though. You're upset, huh? Some game. Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement. You're forgiven. Oooh! Hello? ... all right. I'll meet you in the lobby. But only cause you're paying me to. Any good? Go by yourself then. Where you taking me anyway? No, I don't "got it". Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date. It's very tasteful. I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch. I'm -- joking. I got a dress, yeah. Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time. Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay? Holy shit. Three. But you want days too. Four thousand. Five full nights... days too? It'd cost you. What? I fucked the debate team in high school. Tsk. I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays. You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it? There, see? Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot. Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh? C'mon, I might buy a company some day. What are assets? What? Why? So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm? ... dollars? No shit. They expensive? "Occupational hazard". I like guys if that's what you're asking. Not that I trust'm. I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks. Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself. Where'd you go? Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was. You didn't wake me. I'll be out of here in a minute. If I want you to turn me on I'll pay you three hundred. Just lay back and let me drive. Just a romantic, that's you. Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club. Why? Oooh, thank god. Where are they? Shopping together? Tsk. Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred. I've known a lot of everybody. I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look. Let me guess, you're a... lawyer. Right. So! In town on business? Well, the meter's running, it's your money. Speaking of which, cash'll do. In advance. Do you plan everything? Can I have some chips? Diet coke. Off the boulevard. You mean they don't have hookers. Why? Better believe it. What? Edward... you got it! What's your name, lover. Three hundred. You couldn't afford it. No, but it's getting there. I never joke about money. For an hour. Company would cost you... a hundred dollars. You don't know habits, you think this is ugly. If you're making fun of me, I don't like it. Tell me about it. L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been. I mean, I use condoms. Always. And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer. Day jobs, yeah. I've tried them. Turn right. It pays. What do you want it to be? Vivian, my name's Vivian. Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once. Give me a break. Okay, what ho tel? What motel you staying at? You're not from L.A., huh? Mind if I turn on some heat? Stolen? Nice car. Yours? Sit... and spin. The price just went up to ten. Sure. For five bucks. Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk. Great. What do I look like a tourguide? What? You gonna tell me you're lost? You looking' for some company? Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date? I want to. For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away. Cool your jets a second. Here's some money. Couple a hours. You sure you won't come with me? Want a pair of boots? School, school. Regular. I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know. Get a job and probably go back to school. Figure out what I'm gonna be. I don't care about bucks. I might love this guy. All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it. I don't know what to do. What do I do, Kit? He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money. It was great. I know. I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real. I kissed him, Kit. On the mouth. You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you? Yeah... I know what you mean. Kit... Kit, I left that money for you days ago. Who did you think? Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling. Yeah. Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes? Good stuff on him . Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes. Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent. Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out. He... he just does. Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks! We can get out of the apartment. We can get out of this town. We can do anything! Kit? Hey, you there? Kit! Where've you been? He's not gonna want us. That crack is burning a hole in your pocket. There isn't even milk in the fridge. The rent's due. Now come on -- Forget it. We work for it. We keep it. Looks slow tonight. No, let's go to work. Okay? I thought you were giving up that drug shit. I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster. I wonder how much she made tonight? We worked for that money. We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street. I bet. That was our rent! You spent it on drugs, didn't you? You bullshittin' me? Don't give me that. Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash. Yeah, what? Thanks! Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own? Oooh, I love those. Is that all? You just fold back the bedspread? Okay. What? Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world. You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas. Yeah, well, I check out today. Look I just wanted to say goodbye. Hi, Barney! Me? Professionally? Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands. Steak spoon! I like steak. But what if they serve soup? What if they serve soup? Hmmm... I vonder vich. But I always eat like this. Okay. Thanks, Barney. You're the best. Will I like it? Yeah, mine too. Is it like, y'know, normal? Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner. The Rex. Ever been there? They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney. I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too. Wanna see? I got a dress. Niece? Vivian. I... Edward... I'm -- I'm with a friend. I'm just going to my room. I was in here yesterday. Do you remember me? 'Scume me. I'm going to spend money . What is with you? I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was. You have beautiful things. How much is this? Yes. Something... conservative. I'm just looking, thanks. Get out! Aw, come on, Bill. It's just business. I think it's great. Yeah. Sure. Why not. Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. What? Yeah. Thanks.In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog. Is this your house? An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens. I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it. You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand." None of your business. My mother passed on years ago. Some people grow up and change their ways. Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now. No, I'm a different person now, Harry. I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been? If it was left up to me, I would poison him. Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes. He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox. Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool. Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children. You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog. I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel? Do you think you won? You were in hell? Like muddy waters? Like a veil has been lifted? I'm okay. Go back to your friends. Why in the h... He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love. We could borrow on that land and put the money to work. I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property. You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean. I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea. How old are you? Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child. I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it. Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny. Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now. No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door. I thought you weren't old fashioned. What's a toby? I think he wants to see your rabbit foot. You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.You know the man next door is near death. He is in his pigeon cage. I was just trying to make conversation. Counting the gray hairs in your head.I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough. You sit right there with your no manners self. Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction. Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling. I've heard some foolish things in my life. What for? Well, you look better than you did yesterday. This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air. Who is it? I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at. I don't want to hear any tales about colored people... I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent. It's healing now. I cut it on an old rusty knife. Since this morning. You better come sit down. You are still sick. I need to get out there and get those weeds out. You must have been really sick. You stay inside. I will see to them. Just stay in bed and rest. No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further. Gideon, don't say things like that. You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing. Do you want your coat? It's cold out here. It would be nice. You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them. You're going to find yourself on the floor. Hush. Hush. You and Babe Brother are so much alike... You all act like two roosters. Go back to sleep. Let us settle this tomorrow. Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are. Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom. Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend? I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house. Hattie is a different person now. You must have done something to her. Good afternoon to you. As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest. Let me get you a cup? Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over. He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth. He wasn't able to get out of bed today. Tolerable well. She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil. Harry, you know everything. I have someone I want you to meet. I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him. Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person. One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are. You should go back and rest. Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world. What must I do? I can't accuse him just dry long 80. I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra. You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening. I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house. No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic. I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything. I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful. It is so considerate of you. How are you?
