It's so tiresome. Who would I want to play me? Natalie  Wood. Too fat. Audrey Hepburn? Not bad. Sort of middle-class. I figured you'd missed it. Off. Truman. Off. I'm happy to see you too, but I can  still whip your behind. What all did you bring? You're pathetic. You're pathetic. You paid them to say that. You paid them to say that! "Just when you think they've gotten  as good as they can get." Pathetic. Truman, you're a menace. You can  barely see over the wheel. This make you miss Alabama? Morning. Hi. Can any of you tell me where I'd  find Laura Kinney? Oh, um... Is that her? With the tall boy? Yeah. With Danny Burke. Danny Burke? Thank you. Oh, quiet yourself, Janice. Truman. Truman -- These folks live their lives in a  particular way. You need to consider  adapting yourself to that fact. -- I'm gonna find out where those  two kids live. Maybe you'll let me  do that alone? Let's go. Danny? Would you mind terribly if I walked  with you for a bit? I thought you were from the FBI with  your long coat. That's why I ran off. It's fine talking to you all.  Practically nobody around here wants  to talk since what happened. Folks have been through a rough patch.  Including you. Nancy was your best friend. She was my best friend. How has Danny been? Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible  ever happened to him before. Nancy  just started wearing his ring again  after this huge fight -- Mr. Clutter  was trying to get her to end it 'cause  Danny's Catholic. What were the Clutters? Methodist. Danny was the last person  at the house that night. That's why  Mr. Dewey's keeps interviewing him --  they don't think he had anything to  do with it -- just to see if he  remembers anything unusual and all. People in town seem to wonder if he  was involved. That's been real hard for Danny. I want to show you something. Maybe you'll get a better picture of  Nancy. And the family. What is this? It's her diary. "Danny here tonight and we watched  TV. So nice just having him sit with  us. Left at eleven. P.S. -- He's the  only one I really love." And that was that. "Shattered." 94 percent. I hate that you're better than me at  this. Don't you dare close your eyes on my  bed. Stand up and walk out that door. Go  to your room if you're gonna sleep.  Truman. Truman. Crap. What right do you have being tired?  You were snoring blissfully -- -- while I lay there, hating you -- Not much. What? Marie Dewey?... We've got somewhere  to go for Thanksgiving supper. You came. Hi. Thank you. Get yourselves in here. Alvin! Get your pants on. They're  here. Alvin will hate this. I have to stop. I cannot believe you're from New  Orleans. I miss it so much. You know something -- Alvin pretends  he doesn't know who you are, but the  minute you came to town he read your  books. He had one of his men pick up  "Breakfast at Tiffany's" in Kansas  City 'cause it's banned from the  library here. He liked it more than he's willing  to admit. Alright, one more shake. Hi. How you doing, foxy? Humphrey Bogart. John Huston. It's been a hard couple weeks for  Alvin. He and Herb Clutter were good  friends. From church. Oh come on, Alvin. These are good  people. Twisted notion of tenderness. Thank you. So many of my friends would love to  meet you. That'd be fine -- How long have you worked here? Well, she's marvelous. Lunch was  wonderful. Truman. You remember when we were kids? I had no idea what a homosexual was.  But I knew whatever they were, you  were one of 'em. I can't believe you got this whole  page -- I only read it to you once! You believe that Alvin? I'm sorry. He's upset. -- smoking three packs a day. Two men did it. They know who. One  of them used to have a cellmate who  gave him up for the thousand dollar  reward. They passed through Kansas  City last week writing bad checks --  by the time Alvin's boys got up there  they'd skipped out again. Where to? They have no idea. Alvin ... Tell them we're at dinner, Alvin. Hey. Motorcycle accident. He broke them  and they never healed right. Alvin told me. Truman Capote. "For the maiden of the Midwest, the  priestess of the plains, the queen  of the kitchen: my first novel.  Truman." You're too much. Go on into the living  room, lemme grab that -- it's been  ringing all morning. Oh. Truman. I meant in there. I... um... It's the women's cell. It's hardly  ever used. But they wanted to, um,  separate... Please. Let's sit in the  living room. I'll set up in the living  room. Come. Um. Truman? All set. Mr. Capote. Is that for the two of us to share?  Or for me to eat alone while you  talk to our guest? Truman. Walter's gonna be home soon. Truman -- Where'd Perry get the art set? Close enough. Thanks. Oh yes. Truman in love with Truman. Do you? Hold him in esteem? You tell him your mama did the same  thing? Huh. Christ. I guess it stopped being  funny. When was the last time you wrote  back to him? A letter for your boyfriend I was  asked to deliver. "Dear Friend Truman. Where are you?  Read this item in a medical  dictionary: "Death by hanging is  caused by asphyxia, by fracture of  the cervical vertebrae, by laceration  of the trachea." Not too comforting  as we lost our appeal. Missing you --  alone and desirous of your presence.  Your amigo, Perry." Did you? Fall in love with him. Truman? -- Are you kidding me? Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think  he's what I like about you best. The sixteenth. Truman. Honestly. Are you going back  to Kansas because you care about  Perry or because you need information  before he's killed? No. I don't think it can be. Well... What a gentleman. They'll play outside a while longer. I don't want them to see that. Too many questions. June's dead. Frank shot himself. Now  Perry's did what he did. I suppose  I'm next. Some ruination will visit  me. It does in this family. I used to love him. He was my little  doll. He scares me now. Ten years. Take the whole thing. I don't want'em  anymore. Just... Perry doesn't know where I  live. He thinks we're still in  Portland. Please don't tell him we're  not. Don't be taken in by my brother.  He's got this sensitive side he'll  show. You believe he's gentle, so  easily hurt. But he'd just as soon  kill you as shake your hand. I believe  that. I thought I'd find you here. How are you? I'm sorry to hear that. Uh-huh. It must be hard. I see. And how'd you like the movie, Truman. Mr. Shawn? It's Nelle... I just got  this telegram, has he seen it? Would you put him on please? Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him  down and put the phone on his ear, I  need to speak to him. Truman. Hello. They're dead, Truman. You're alive. Maybe not. But the fact is, you didn't want to.
