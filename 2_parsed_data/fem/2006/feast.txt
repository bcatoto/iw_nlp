He said there was no reason I had to  stay a teller and that if I did good  work and didn't mess up, I could  become an assistant manager within  three years. Can you believe that? That sounds like bullshit! I could  be an assistant manager at The Lake  Arrowhead Casino for knowing the  fuckin' alphabet to G! I'll be twenty  in three months... If I could made that kind of money,  I'd be in Hollywood next week. You should be so lucky. Shit! Shit! Shit! HELP ME! SOMEBODY! GET DOWN! Goddamn you! The jungle has a new king. My husband... He's dead. Easy. We're surrounded by something  the likes none of you have ever seen  before. Some kind of animals. Real  fast, volatile, predators. One went  through three of your patrons like  nothing. He only shot you once. He shot you the other time. That's one piece of four problems. That head over there, that's the  oldest of the bunch, looked like the  Grandpa. We caught the little one,  Junior, in the cooler there. As we've  seen, what he lacks in size he more  than makes up for in speed. Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are  still outside. The next one is taller, but all out  of proportion. Like a "teen beast." He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly  just the same. I just took the eye out of the mother.  She calculates, guiding the attacks. If you are face to face with her,  dive left. Father. The biggest, the strongest... No sign of any weaknesses. No sign  at all. He's an eating machine. That's not it. Four are here, but  there's three others... which I can't  account for. We need to lock this place down. Is  everyone in this room? Wait! Stop her! Let's lock off this room. Damn it. Just let her be... please. Is that the only phone? This is really happening. I can't  believe this is really happening. I didn't say anything. What's this? A power magnet or  something? I didn't peg you for a con man. Lots of stuff around here does. Here! Hey! I wouldn't do that. You can risk your life, but not mine!  My daughter's no more than twenty  miles from here waiting for me. I  have just as much reason to leave  this place as you do. But I also  know that if they're here, then  they're not there yet. You understand me? You understand me!? Now pull that tough boy shit again  and I'll slice you from neck to nuts! We can't risk letting them in. See! This has to be isolated. That's  a local broadcast. My daughter's in Red Mountain. Oh no. I'm calling them... it's ringing! Hello? Yes, we're at the United -- Oh no! Oh fucking no! Keep it together! I came from the  east. That studio is south of here.  For all we know, north and west are  okay. So, that leaves the west. Right. Let's work. We have to kill it. Can you help? Jesus, it took all that? All those  bullets? How can we possibly fight  off the others? Aim for their orifices. Eyes, ears  and mouth. From what I've seen, it's  their only weakness. Maybe we don't have to fight them. What are you doing? Is there a call, or something? Oh... my... god. Get back! Well, it all started about forty  hours ago... So, how is staying with Grandma  working out? Ya know, if you stare  into her glasses, you can see what  cards she is holding. But I didn't  tell you that. Mommy will pick you up tomorrow night,  okay baby? Hello? Charlie? We barricaded ourselves in the cellar.  Then it was just listening. We heard  those things destroy an entire heard  of livestock. They just kept coming.  Closer and closer, consuming anything  in the way. Slashing, feeding and  licking the bones clean. Just when  we said our prayers, the first ray  of sun hit the house... That first beam of sunlight drove  'em away. Somewhere. We called who  we could and then decided to run for  it. We didn't see a soul the whole  drive out. When the tank went dry,  we came upon a gas station to refill. They've been here! We had no time. All we knew was the  sun was dropping and we had to get  enough fuel to make it through the  night at 90 miles per hour... It happened fast... That's when I saw three others...  just for a second. Close the roof! It must have smelled the blood or  something. We buried the body and  got back on the main road when... And that's how I ended up here. I don't want to talk about that. No. It was wild out there. No time  to think. We just moved. He didn't  leave me. He just ran. It appears so. Yeah. Well, maybe they migrate? As long as it's dark, they're around.  They hide, wait for you to drop your  guard, and then attack. How can you be so sure? You said  yourself this started a day ago. We learned fast. Fine. Somebody's gotta know something about  these things. This stuff just doesn't  happen out of the blue. Heavens no! Relax, they don't know anything. East. Why? Previous owners did, I think. I still don't get it. Careful. Everyone stay in the middle of the  room! Off the walls! NOW! Now, does everyone agree that they  are still out there? 'Eh, Chief? He's out cold. I know some first aid if we have a  kit. Do we? No one goes anywhere alone. Least of  all, unarmed. Alright, we need to stay alert and  for everyone to take a role. You gotta have some guns or weapons  around here. Okay, well that's something. Alright, what else do we have? Can  we somehow contact the outside world? I can't get anybody. I don't even  know if I have a signal anymore. You said you had a short wave radio. Where? Good. I'm heading to the basement  for supplies. And you're going upstairs. Step up, Chief. No. You're locked in. Those two will be on the other side  waiting for you. If you become food,  I don't want the only set of keys in  the belly of one of those things. Any volunteers to head into the  basement with me? Alright. How are you holding up? What is this? No other time than now, right? But -- What's this? Doesn't your foot hurt? How 'bout now? Um-hmmm. Let's get everything upstairs. I'm sorry. I admire your strength. This is my daughter, Charlie. She's  all I'm after. And I'm gonna need your strength,  every bit of it. Good. But still do me a favor. Don't tell anyone I have a soft side. You wanna see, baby? How much you got? How much you got to see the show? What? Um, hmm -- What was that? Move it! What happened? I told you to stay in the main room. We know what not to do. We must stay  focused and together. The beasts  will find a breach. We gotta find a  way out before they find a way in. What? You know what. You. What was that door downstairs? Don't bullshit me. What's it for? What's it for!? Does the tunnel spit out near a car? It's a shot. Is it gassed up? Four door? How many can it hold? Max? It's gonna fit thirteen. Keys. Three of us go. Two to defend, one  to drive. We back up to the bar and  then tear ass out of here. Let me make this clear; if we stay,  we die. Hey! I'm not trusting him either,  that's why I'm going with. This is it. They have this place  surrounded, but if we go under them  we might just make it. The rest of you prepare the weapons,  whatever you got left. 'Cause when  we crash through those walls, we're  bringin' death with us. How does it feel? You still have one left. It serves you right for cheating. I figure it's karma. You wronged me  and you wronged your wife, so this  is karma biting you on the ass, or  in your case... in the eye. It could be worse, you could be dead.  Then again, the climax is upon us. I wouldn't fuck you for practice. Neither. Just a farmer. I just think about my husband and  daughter... and the rest is easy. Easy. Let's go. Quiet. Move. Go! The bitch is mine! Look out! You fuck with my family.  I fuck right back! Oh shit. Send it up! Send it up! Move it! Move it! Move it! Goddamn it! Do something! I'M ALIVE! OPEN THE DOOR! What the fuck are you doing?! YOU'RE KILLING HER! F-f-fuck you. I think they made it. Stop trying to get people killed. It  is getting very old. What's this? I need some shells. Let's prepare ourselves, they ought  to be here with the truck any minute. That's your choice, but this is going  to get a whole lot worse before it  gets any better. Get on the tables!!! On the tables!!! Settle down! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! What's Plan B? Now! Help me! Come on! Do something!!! Come on, I'll help you. I'm not leaving anyone behind. Maybe next time, dear. She's still out here. Stay put. Where are you... come on... Come on! Come on! Come and get me you blood-chugging You got her? You got her! Not for long, we gotta burn it. Come on! Let's blow this thing! Here we go... She's calling for help. We have to run -- Get to your cars!!! I don't know, I think -- We're safe until dark, but we need  to find other people. You know where the IGA grocery store  is over in Red Mountain? They have a bomb shelter. We'll meet in three hours? We're going to get my little girl. Oh no... It's right up there, in the back of  the store. Where is everyone? She's supposed to already be here. This place is a ghost town. Charlie? Charlie! Honey!? I love you... You're not safe, she's still alive,  she'll be back... G'morning. Where are you taking us?
