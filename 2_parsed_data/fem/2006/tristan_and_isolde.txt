We heard the news...  Tristan! Hurry! Come this way.  Tristan!  Will I?  Why did she die Bragnae? Why?  No. It was her heart.   Melot!  Melot, this is Tristan.  Melot!  What do you think is really out there?  I want to see it. Do you know what the  future looks like Bragnae?  Am I just a chattel to be traded at  your pleasure? Do I have no say in my  own life?  You are my father.  I accept it.  How so?  Rendered safe by thistle and bark.  Yohimbine.   No! No! Please No!  He knew. He knew.  Away.  I am no ones charge!  And live a loveless life like my mam?  Where?  It’s a man.  Alive! Bragnae help me!  Help me!  Start a fire! Quickly!  His heart falters.  He needs heat. Now! Get your clothes  off! Quickly!  Hurry! Quickly! Smell that? Smell the  poison? When he warms we will need thistle  and bark.  Hello.  You've been sleeping a long  time. You're in Ireland. Did you know  that? Shh... It's alright. You're safe  here. No one knows. Don't be scared.  Just sleep... sleep.  It’s alright, you don’t need that! I  forgot to tell him about you...  Sorry... She’s... My maid. Sworn to  silence. Um... lie down please. Please?  It’s good you are remembering things.  else? The boat I found you in? How you  got this? Too many questions. Here keep  it dry. Here I found bread, you have  water and fire. The ocean is outside  if you wish a bath. You won’t know where  you are going so please don’t try to  leave. Just trust me.  I’ll be back  Then we’ve got him prisoner.  I had noticed. Yes I have a bit.  Bragnae and I were spying the convent  of Brittes ].  Some women need it.  Any word of my betrothed?  Oh, I think it's better if we don't  bother with names.  You just did. If you insist... my name  is Bragnae. I'm a lady in waiting at  the court. My parents are dead. My mother,  she is the source of the kindness you  find so puzzling. My father would've  left you where you fell.  Well Tristan of Aragon, I'd guess about  you too, but I think I've already seen  everything.  There. What of your parents?  Of what?  Sorry.  Tomorrow then?  There she who bore you brought you forth.  I happen to believe what that says.  Don’t you think there is more to life?  Something more than duty and death!  Why are we capable of feelings if not  to have them? Why long for things if  they are not meant to be ours? Well  don’t listen to me. You’re so sure of  things. You’re certainty, it’s like  armour. I wish I had that.  The joy of being a lady? Wanting something  I can’t have. A life of my own.  I’ll follow you later.  Yes.  Dark. Tall. Nearly twice your size.  An absolute gentleman.  I didn’t know what I was talking about.  Outside, just past that bluff there  is a boat. That’s how you should go  when you leave. You should go soon.  I don’t know  Tristan! They’ve found your boat. At  this very moment the King himself is  scouring the coast. He will find you.  He finds everyone. The tide is coming  let’s go!  I can’t  Tristan, we’ve both known this can’t  be. We’ve known this from the start.  That doesn’t mean it isn’t true. It  is. It just cannot be. I want to know  that you are alive somewhere thinking  of me from time to time. I want to know  that there is more to this life and  I can’t know that if they kill you.  Please?  Go!  Tristan!  "My face in thine eyes, thine in mine  appears,  No, not quite. If I am to be a present  I should be fully wrapped.   I’m yours.  You risked your life to give me to another  man.  Oh what have I done? Stop this thing.  Say something.  But I am yours. You touched me and I  yielded...  It is the only thing that matters Tristan.  Leave with me, I will go anywhere.  My marriage to another man!  Don't do this to me.  She will brother. You’re the prize.  My Lord.   If things were different. If we lived  in a place without duty... would you  be with me?  I'll pretend it's you.  It was a present.  Tristan!  Perhaps someone his own age should speak  with him.  They believe you are distant. They are  worried about you. So am I.  He is my husband. I remember his Kingdom  comes before my life.  Am I not permitted a single moment without  mourning? Living with this Tristan as  you said we must.  The Roman Bridge. I can get to it without  being seen. And I will go there anytime  to be there with you.  Why?  But they are not life Tristan. They  are the shells of life. And empty ones  and in the end all they hold is days  and days without love. Love is made  by God. Ignore it and you can suffer  as you cannot imagine.  Late?  How many did you love before me?  And after me?  What do you think became of them?  I find myself imaging things in this  place. I decorate it. Books, a harp  there... a child.  I would have no way to tell, would I?  He is a kind man Tristan, I cannot hate  him. Yesterday at the market I saw a  couple holding hands, and I realised  we would never do that. Never anything  like it. No picnics or unguarded smiles.  No rings. Just stolen moments that leave  too quickly.  I hate this.  Then don’t.  There is a servings child, quite ill.  Doing better now.  Is it?  I’m fine.  Why did you burn it?  Meet me there in an hour or I’ll die.  Accuse him now.  I’m just feeling a little weary that’s  all. I might just go and have a lie  down.  I miss Ireland  That’s like asking me to stop breathing.  Please don’t leave me. Please!  It’s not like that.  Since you thought he was dead. I found  him wounded on the beach in Ireland.  I hid him from my father and I told  him my name was Bragnae. So when he  came to the tournament at Dunluce to  win Donnchadh’s daughter he didn’t realise  it was me. All this time my heart has  been his, and I am sorry. He tried harder  than you can possibly imagine because  he loves you.  I told him about Ireland. He’s given  us our freedom. Why does loving you  feel so wrong?  Tristan, if I do this.  Tristan, don’t! Tristan! Tristan! Tristan!  Why?! Tristan!  Know that I love you Tristan. And wherever  you go, whatever you see, I will always  be with you.  "My face in thine eyes, thine in mine  appears,
