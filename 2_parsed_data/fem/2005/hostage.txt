We'll see you in a couple of hours. You're hiding, Jeffrey. You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.Look at him! I think he's dying! What about my father? I'm getting a doctor! All you're doing is watching yourself on TV. Look at him. My father needs a doctor. Please . He needs a doctor. My father. He can't reach us in here. We're safe. Better than you getting killed! Don't touch that gun! Daddy says -- You leave that gun alone! Go! If you get out, maybe you can help the police! You go, Thomas. You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy. No! I'm not going to leave Daddy with them! Mine, too. No one's coming. Ow! Shit! Stop it. You'd better get out of here! Kevin's coming back! I don't know what you're talking about. How about dog shit? What? What do you want? What I want is to help my father. I don't drink beer. Yes. How can we get out? I can't go without Thomas. What happened? What do you want? If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder. Can't you make Dennis see that? Kevin, my father needs a doctor. Thanks for the shirt. I don't see why you can't just lock me in. It's not like I can go anywhere. Please get away from me.His cell number belongs to the Smiths. I think it's real, Chief. I think this boy is inside that house. We have a boy on the line.
