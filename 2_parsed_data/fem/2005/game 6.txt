He will absolutely hate it. It's your best play, Nicky. It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel. I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight? Because we're completely mismatched. We're able to surprise each other. I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done. It can't be all that personal. You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning. What? Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else. Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan. That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed. They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all. Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie. Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course. She died. What about her? Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution. Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.Daddy, wait. Will I believe you when you tell me something? What will we talk about? Except I won't have a father anymore. I'm not sure. I have a class. I'm late. I don't have a date. I don't want a date. Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it. I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition? Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going. I didn't turn her into Mother. You did. Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me? She is kicking you out. Oh please. Not now. She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years. Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused. Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back. She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee' Is it? So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer? I'm seeing your play tonight, remember? I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about. I go to college. I thought you knew. See, Daddy. What else? See, Daddy. Yes. And no more evasive tactics. Yes. You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name? Knowing who a person is. Down deep. Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy. What do we want? I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself. Yes. A flat-out hit. Packs an emotional wallop. Brilliantly moving. You have to tell me what you thought of the play. I'm willing to tell you my name. Why won't you tell me your name?I'm glad we're having this talk. I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office. It violates so many trusts. She's my gynecologist. Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you? Joanne Bourne. I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years. Be open with me. I'd like that. That's very lovely actually. I'd forgotten that. You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian. That's always been my problem. Who the hell cares? I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier. He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut. I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer. I want to be fair-minded, Nicky. I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column. Your father said you might be here.Alla puttanesca. Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice. Elliot? Guys ready to order? He feels he has to defend himself if necessary. He goes to the theater armed. Our Steven not only disguises himself. Never mind. Do you want to talk about doing crazy things. But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom? If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what? No one's waiting. Home. He's a very sweet man. Do you think he can do it? Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play. Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone. Is what true? The fact is, I have to get going. He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue. Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously. I hear good things about the new play. I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows. Alla puttanesca. What? A little drastic maybe? Engaging. He has -- something. A funny little quality I find -- A little. Not one of Steven's finer moments. I think I remember. I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him? We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca. I'm going home to my machine. I don't want you, Steven. Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider. Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently. In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair. I haven't come to you.This could be it! Don't worry. It's a test. Because faith is rewarded. Washed away. Because God loves a winner. Matthew. Speak it like it's real. Matthew. Then say it. Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it. If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down. You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person. You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody. It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work. Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy. It's a simple subject. And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it. An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do? You're a family man, Frankie? Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once. Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury. You're charming the boy. You see what you're doing, don't you? That's a simple subject. This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming. He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before. Matthew's my grandson. Might be an accident on the West Side Highway. The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro? Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars. Where's your white Lincoln limo? You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island. I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
