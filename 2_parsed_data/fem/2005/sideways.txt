Look what the cat dragged! Hey, Miles. Christine, why don't you ask Miles  about the cake? Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to  the kitchen with me. It'll just take a second. Jack tells us you are publishing a  book. Congratulations. Your friend is modest. So which one do you like better? You guys having fun? Good. That's good. Just seeing how you're doing. And,  um, Mom and I were starting to look  over the seating charts again, and  we're wondering if you wanted Tony  Levin to sit next to the Feldmans,  or should he be at one of the singles  tables? So what do you think? With the  Feldmans? Really? Because I don't know, I was  thinking that -- The problem with that is that then  there's one extra -- Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to  include you in this decision. He's  your friend. I'm not going to call every five  minutes, but this is important. Why are you being so defensive? I ask you one simple question, and  suddenly I'm attacking you. Bye. Bye. My God. Miles. And Jack! What a  surprise. I can't remember the last  time you brought me flowers. A famous actor bringing me flowers  on my birthday. Don't I feel special? Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I  hope that girls knows how lucky she  is, marrying no less than Derek  Summersby. Well, you were wonderful on that  show. I never understood why they  had to give you that brain tumor so  soon. Why that didn't make you the  biggest movie star in the world is a  sin. It's a sin. If I was, I would sing your praises  up and down the street until they  put me in the loony bin. Now Miles,  why didn't you tell me you were coming  and bringing this handsome man? Look  how I'm dressed. I've got to run and  put my face on. Oh, stop it. Make yourselves  comfortable. You boys hungry? Ready for my close up! Oh, champagne! Miles, why don't you  bring that out onto the lanai? I  thought we could eat on the lanai. They're just leftovers. I could have made something fancier  if a certain someone had let me know  that a certain someone was coming  for a visit with a certain special  friend. Could have made a pork roast. And I could have already put clean  sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and  the twins are picking us up at 11:30  to go to brunch at the Sheraton.  They do a magnificent job there.  Wendy is so excited you're coming. Just now. She's thrilled. And the  kids. Well, you boys do what you want. I  just think it would be nice for us  to be together as a family on my  birthday. And what was that other one you did,  the one where you're the jogger? Spray and Wash. That's the one. I just remember you jogging. So when's  the wedding? Miles, when are you going to get  married again? You should get back together with  Victoria. She was good for you. She was good for you. And so beautiful and intelligent.  You knew her, right? I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you  need some money? Hey, Miles. Good to see you. I'm doing good, good. You look great.  Did you lose some weight? Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been  out tasting today? Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here.  Bye, Miles. Highliner, please. Hey, guys. Sure. So how's that book of yours going,  Miles? I think you were almost done  with it last time we talked. Good for you. That's fantastic. Congratulations. Are you a writer too? Oh yeah? What kind of stuff? Anything I'd know? That's hilarious. You sound just  like one of those guys. You are not. Oh. I needed that. Thank you. So what are you guys up to tonight? Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a  long drive up here. Where're you  staying? Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack. Hey, guys. How's it going? That's what people say. Well, no better way to learn than  tasting. Stephanie. So what do you think? Cabernet Franc. This is only the fifth year we've  made this varietal. Very few wineries  around here do a straight Cabernet  Franc. It's from our vineyard up in  Santa Maria. And it was a Silver  Medal winner at Paso Robles last  year. In Santa Ynez. And I agree with you about Cab Franc. Oh yeah. Sure I know Maya. Real well. This is our Estate Syrah... I know. I might need to be spanked. Excuse me. Good. How're you? Not so bad yourself. A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc. Try it. Twelve months in oak. I know the winemaker. She comes in  the restaurant all the time. I know. I love that. I guess Miles wants it. You choose, Stephanie. So what does everyone feel like? No, we're paying for the wine. Well, in that case... What's everyone ordering? Then we  can sort out the wine. I'm having the salmon. I'm thinking about the duck breast. Well, that narrows things down. Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me. Hello? Miles? Fine. What's, uh, what's on your  mind? Oh, Miles. You're drunk. Where are you? Miles, don't call me when you're  drunk. Ken. Miles, I don't care if you come to  the wedding or not. I'm going to hang up now, Miles. Miles, maybe it is better if you  don't come to the wedding. Are you all right? Excuse us. Sorry to make you get up again, Miles. We were thinking. Why don't we go  back to my place? I've got wine,  some insane cheeses, music, whatever. What happened to you guys? Hi. Maya's in the kitchen. Hey. Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots  and Syrahs. Hey, Steph? You sure we can open  anything? Anything we want? Anything but the Jayer Richebourg! Who do you think you're dealing with  here? How about this? Nope. I don't think we know each  other well enough. I'd say this guy's more our speed. So what gems do you have in your  collection? You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's  just sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up... Seriously, the '61s are peaking,  aren't they? At least that's what  I've read. It might be too late already. What  are you waiting for? The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc,  that's the special occasion. I started to get serious about seven  years ago. Eighty-eight Sassicaia. I think they overdid it a bit. Too  much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit. Yeah, Siena's a sweetie. She's with her grandmother. She's  with Steph's mom. She spends a lot  of time over there. Steph's... well,  she's Stephanie. You got kids? Yeah, same here. Let's go in there. Looks like our friends are hitting  it off. It's kind of weird sitting here with  you in Stephanie's house. All those  times you came into the restaurant.  It's like you're a real person now.  Almost. Yeah, weird. But great. So what's your novel about? What's the title? Oh. You mean... today? So is it kind of about death and  mortality, or...? Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing  you're getting it published. Really.  I know how hard it is. Just to write  it even. Like me, I have this stupid paper  due on Friday, and as usual I'm  freaked out about it. Just like in  high school. It never changes. Yeah. I'm working on a masters in  horticulture. Chipping away at it. I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a  week. Well... Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of  typos. Wow, this is really starting to open  up. What do you think? Can I ask you a personal question? Why are you so into Pinot? It's like  a thing with you. What about me? I suppose I got really into wine  originally through my ex-husband. He  had a big, kind of show-off cellar.  But then I found out that I have a  really sharp palate, and the more I  drank, the more I liked what it made  me think about. Like what a fraud he was. No, but I do like to think about the  life of wine, how it's a living thing.  I like to think about what was going  on the year the grapes were growing,  how the sun was shining that summer  or if it rained... what the weather  was like. I think about all those  people who tended and picked the  grapes, and if it's an old wine, how  many of them must be dead by now. I  love how wine continues to evolve,  how every time I open a bottle it's  going to taste different than if I  had opened it on any other day.  Because a bottle of wine is actually  alive -- it's constantly evolving  and gaining complexity. That is,  until it peaks -- like your '61 --  and begins its steady, inevitable  decline. And it tastes so fucking  good. Yeah. I was just getting some water. You  want some water? Nice. I should probably get going. You know how to get back to the  Windmill, right? I had a good time tonight, Miles. I  really did. Okay. See you around. Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course. Wow. Great. Goodnight, Miles. That was fun last night. Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this  morning. She said she had a good  time too. You should call her. Where's Jack? So what are you up to today, Miles? Huh. Oops. Sorry. Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid  game. I mean, at least, I could never  get into it. I tried it once. Hi, guys. We should probably get  going. Stephanie's heard this a thousand  times, but if I'd done what I wanted  and I'd bought up in Santa Maria  when I had the chance, I would have  made a fortune when they put in that  outlet center and that Home Depot. Your father knew it too, but he was  a fucking chickenshit. Always was. See you, Miles. You take care. Bye, Miles. Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the  restaurant last night looking for  me. I had class. You too. You guys should stop by the restaurant  for lunch today. About two-thirty. Did you hear about this Bordeaux  tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara  Saturday night? It's a little pricey,  but if you wanted to go, I'd be into  it. Why don't you stay through the  weekend? What rehearsal dinner? Who's getting married? Were you ever going to say anything? Don't touch me. Just take me home. Do you know what he's been saying to  her? Oh, just that he loves her. That  she's the only woman who has ever  really rocked his world. How he adores  Siena. How he wants to move up here  and get a place with the two of them  and commute when he has to. But you wanted to fuck me first. Yeah. You know, I just spent three years  trying to extricate myself from a  relationship that turned out to be  full of deception. And I've been  doing just fine. Could I have my paper, please? Miles. How's the trip? Actually there is word. I spoke to  Keith Kurtzman this morning. And... they're passing. Conundrum's  passing. He said they really liked  it. They really wanted to do it, but  they just couldn't figure out how to  market it. He said it was a tough  call. I'm sorry, Miles. So I don't know where that leaves  us. I'm not sure how much more mileage  I can get out of continuing to submit  it. I think it's one of those  unfortunate cases in the business  right now -- a fabulous book with no  home. The whole industry's gotten  gutless. It's not about the quality  of the books. It's about the  marketing. Are you there? Miles? I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could.  You've been a real trooper. Tell him I'll call back. You're a wonderful writer, Miles.  Don't be discouraged. Just hang in there, and who knows?  After you get something else  published, we can revisit this one.  And next time we can try a different  title. YOU MOTHERFUCKER! You fucking bastard! Lying piece of  shit! You're getting married on  Saturday? What was all that shit you  said to me? You said you loved me! You fuck! I  hope you die! Fuckface! You too! Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message. It's all in the wrist. You know, you look really familiar.  You from around here? Where'd you go  to high school? I don't know. You just seem really  familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy  your meals. Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean  from "One Life to Live"? No. Way. No way! Oh, my God! Uh, sure, it's right over there,  right past the buffalo. I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl. I picked him up and I fucked him.  I'm a bad girl. I liked it when you caught me fucking  him. The wallet! He took Derek's wallet! Get him! Hey, Miles. Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my  husband. Yeah, he's good that way. Very  considerate. So how're you doing? So what's happening with your book? Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are  you going to do? I am. I guess. Not me. I'm not drinking. I'm pregnant. See you over there, Miles. Hello, Miles. It's Maya. Thanks for your letter. I would have  called you sooner, but I think I've  needed some time to think about  everything that happened and what  you wrote to me. Another reason I  didn't call sooner is that I wanted  to finish your book, which I finally  did last night. I think it's really lovely, Miles.  You're so good with words. Who cares  if it's not getting published? There  are so many beautiful and painful  things about it. Did you really go  through all that? It must have been  awfully hard. And the sister character -- Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to  say I was really confused by the  ending. Did the father finally commit  suicide, or what? It's driving me  crazy. And the title. Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy  here lately. But I like winter. So  listen, if you ever do decide to  come up here again, you should let  me know. I would say stop by the  Hitching Post, but to tell you the  truth I'm not sure how much longer  I'm going to be working there. I'm  going to graduate soon so I'll  probably relocate. We'll see. Anyway, like I said, I really loved  your novel. Don't give up, Miles.  Keep writing. You're really good.  Hope you're well. Bye.
