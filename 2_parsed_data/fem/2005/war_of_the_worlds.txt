We said 8:00. Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,  depending on the traffic. Hello dad. (suit case in hand) I'll just get it  in the door. It's got rollers, just roll it. Well we can't roll it up the stairs  now can we? You're out of milk. (smells it) And  everything else. Bye Tim. I'd better get this upstairs. (trying to get her bag form Mary Ann)  Mom, Mom! I can get it. A little old to still be sharing aren't  they? No, I do. Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie  to make sure he's listening) ...on the  French occupation of Algeria due Monday  which he's yet to begin. It would be  nice if he were done by the time we  got back so we don't have to keep him  up all night on Sunday. No, you just got to start writing it  first. I love you. (begins walking over to  Rachel) Listen to your father. Oh, no shoes on the bed. We'll be at my parent's house in Boston  but don't call the house line, because  you know. Well the point is I've got  my cell phone. So if anything comes  up, or if you have any questions just  call. I'll leave the phone on. You think? Take care of our kids. (laughs) She'll love that. What's the capital of Australia? That's not how you're going to get through  to him. You want him to listen to you... Where are you going? What are we supposed to eat? I got a splinter. On your porch railing. Absolutely not! No it wont. No, it won't. When it's ready, my body  will just push it out. I read that. (as she sits back down)  You should get TiVo. Tim got it for  my room. It's awesome. I can watch all  my shows after homework. Hummus. From the health food place. I kept one  of their menus last time we were here. Uh, you said order! He went out. I don't know. He just took your car  and left. I want to go inside. I want to go inside. I don't want to go by myself. No. No it's not. It hit right behind our house. Where's Robbie? Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you  okay? Why won't it stop? (with hesitation) Is it over? Where are you going? Are we going to be okay? You don't know. What's going on? Dad, what's the matter? What's all the stuff? Dad, you're really scaring me. Dad. (break) Dad! Who's car is this? Who's car is this? What do you mean? Is this the terrorists?!?! (panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes... (keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my  space. I'm really scared. No.... Yes. (relatively calm) Yes. The what? I'm fine. I want mom. I want mom. Take me to Mom's! Come on, hurry up Dad... Robbie, get the door.... (she knocks  on it) (begins, and continues once in the house) Is she dead?? How come the lights are on here and  not at your place? Dad. That's not how it goes. I'm allergic to peanut butter. (with a snotty look) Birth! I'm not hungry. If everything's fine, why do we have  to sleep in the basement. We've got  perfectly good beds. I want to sleep in my bed. I've got  back problems. There's gonna be tornadoes? Could you be a little nicer to me. God! Yeah. Good night, love you. Is the lighting back? Are we still alive? I'm not gonna look, dad. Um-Huh. Why are you yelling? Where is everybody? Okay, enough Robbie! Dad?!?! I have to go to the bathroom. I gotta go. I'm sorry! Where's everybody going? But we do right? Why'd he do that? Why is he doing that? Can we give him one? (screams) AHHHH!! Looks like the power's still on here. Unless you are O-positive and Rh negative,  thank you but we already have more blood  than we can use. Again... (repeats message) Ray! RAY?!?! Yeah. Oh, my gosh, are these your kids? Hi, I'm Sheryl, this is my daughter,  Nora. He's just like dad. How you doing? You look like shit. (to herself) The trees are funny. I got you Ferrier. (trips) oh, Jesus! Jesus. Oh my god! Oh, Ray!! RAY!!! (seeing Robbie running to the stern)  Robbie? Robbie!?!?! Robbie, slow down. Robbie, slow down!!! Robbie. Robbie!! NO!! ROBBIE!!! COME BACK!!! We thought she was alone... we.... Dad? (about ready to cry) What do you think  mom's doing right this minute? I won. The walk, trot, and canter. Third place. Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"? Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"? What are you doing? Dad?? Dad? Hushabye Mountains (begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze.... ... On Hushabye Mountain... ... For far away my baby goes... ... it fills the sails ... ... of boats that are waiting ... ... Waiting to sail your worries away ... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye  Mountain ... ... Wave goodbye to the cares of the  day and watch your boat, from Hushabye  Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby  Bay. (screams) AHHHH!!! (screams) AHHHHH!!!! Dad? What happened to it? How is it dead all by it's self? (just barely hearable) Thank you. Robbie?
