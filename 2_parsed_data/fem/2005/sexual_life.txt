Hmm.  Simon and Garfunkel hit.  Eight letters.  Any thoughts? Excuse me, whatever happened to that sign, the one that used  to hang next to the pies? The one that said, "Today is the first day of the rest of your  life." Oh. She'll have the steak and egg special. Lorna turns as TERRI, her roommate, joins her at the counter. Look at her, she needs protein.  Lots of protein. (to the Waitress) White toast.  Dry. The Waitress leaves. Working early today, huh? No, I had something important to do... Terri opens her bag and pulls out a small, gift-wrapped box. ...Miss nineteen. I knew you'd remember. Terri gives Lorna a kiss on the lips. Of course I remembered.  Go on, open it. No, no.  I wasn't born until ten minutes before midnight.  And  that's when I'll open it. You better like it.  I don't want to tell what I had to do to  pay for it. Ooh.  It must be good. So what's the plan, Stan?  Something special today?  Other than  splurging on toast. Yes.  There is something. Good.  Count me in. No.  Something big.  Something I've been thinking about for a  long time. I can't do this forever, Terri.  Look... Lorna points to the corner of her eye. Crow's feet!  I'm nineteen!  Crow's feet!  I know I keep talking  about it, but this time I'm going to do it.  In fact, I did it. Okay... I called them.  I told them I was out. You did not. Uh-huh.  I have one more appointment.  Then, I'm...free. Give me your cell phone.  I'm calling them back right now. Lorna smiles and pours the shattered remnants of her phone on  the counter. A bus ran over it.  Isn't that perfect?  It's a perfect sign. I know, I know.  I'm not going to light the damn thing. (beat) Fuck me. Look, I'm good for next month's rent. This takes Terri by surprise. What, you're leaving too? Maybe.  Get out of town for a while.  I really feel good about  this. I wish you'd talked to me first. I didn't because...I knew you'd try to talk me out of it. That's because I'm looking out for you.  It's because there is  so much opportunity here. I know. (beat) Listen, I'm late. Lorna leaves some change on the counter, picks up her gift and  gives Terri a hug. Thanks. Well...Happy Birthday. As Lorna goes, the Waitress reappears. Hard to say. Not including tip. She smiles.  Todd paces uneasily. Depends on how generous you feel. Is...this your first appointment? Come over here, you're making me nervous. He plops down next to her. So, how much extra do you feel like spending? Uh-huh. She thumbs through the wedding photos. So, this is what you do.  Weddings. These are good.  You're really a good photographer. And you can only spend another fifty on me? Todd walked right into that one. LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) Maybe you'll feel more generous once you get to know me. Lorna smiles.  Her face has an open, unguarded beauty. Yeah, I've heard. Gee, I've never hear that one before. She laughs at him.  But it's not unkind. LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) I have a friend who makes photos.  She's had some stuff in magazines. Why? She photographs people pissing on each other. Yeah...disgusting. But who would want to look at that?  I mean, bathrooms have doors  for a reason. I like things that make me happy.  Like this. Lorna holds up a photo of a beautiful, smiling bride. I bet she's going to have a very happy life. She lingers over the photo. I don't think I'm the marrying kind, though. I'm not sure people can be true, that's all. Well...Now that we've gotten to know each better, maybe we should  get started. Oh, you really have a big cock...My, you really have a big cock...God,  what a big cock you have. As she goes about her work, Lorna wears a vaguely puzzled expressions. Forty-two across...Simon & Garfunkel hit...eight letters...begins  with 'I'...I...I'm A Loser...Did they sing that?...Susie used  to play Mom's Simon & Garfunkel records all the time...I scratched  one once and she pulled my hair...I haven't spoken to her for  almost a year...Her little kid must be walking by now...Maybe  I should give Susie a call...Nah, fuck that!  She's perfectly  capable of calling me...I mean, I'm listed...I'm...I am a rock...that's  it!...I Am A Rock, that's the answer...I am a-- (flatly) God, you really have a big cock. Like Pavlov's proverbial dog, Todd MOANS and the whole thing  is quickly over. Wow.  That was something. Let me tell you...that was something. Cut the modesty.  You really know what you're doing. (into phone) Hey, it's Lorna...I'm clocking out for the last time...No, I'm  not done for the day, I'm done...Wait, I don't think you heard  me...Well, just give it to one of the other girls.  Give it to  Terri...I don't care if he's an important client, I told you  I'm...Well, you'll just have to cancel it, won't you?...I don't  care what it pays, it's not my fuckin'-- (into phone) Hold on... (to Todd) What? I'm fine.  The cab fare will be another twenty. Of course I did.  Are you calling me a liar? (into phone) Alright.  Where is it? Make a right at the light. He does. Go on, ask. Pull over. Pull over here. He does.  Up the block is a high-rise, luxury hotel.  Limos and  cabs line the driveway.  Uniformed doormen guard the entrance. You see that hotel?  In one of those rooms, there's a man waiting...he's  waiting for me.  I don't know what his name is or what he looks  like.  He may have bad skin.  He may be really ugly.  But no  matter how he looks, or how bad he smells, or whether he makes  weird wheezing sounds when he comes, I tell him the same thing...the  same thing I told you. To think what? It's Todd, right. Well, Todd, you're alright. (beat) And that I don't say that to everyone. She opens the door, starts out-- No. You can't.  You can't see me again. (beat) But thanks for asking. Shit!  Sold out! Sarah, at twenty-five, is cute, brainy, articulate, and hopelessly  insecure. I am so sorry. I could just kill him!  This is not the first time he's done  this, either. Cooked up some phony emergency, right as I'm getting on the elevator. We're talking about the most self-centered man I have ever met. Ruin my evening.  Our evening. (without a beat) You know, he also thinks he's God's gift to women.  I'm surprised  he hasn't been sued by now...Okay, okay.  Stop me. Okay.  I'm taking a breath. And she does. I like you.  Have I told you that? You know what I want to do?  I want to go shopping. For a house. Look at the detail on that one.  Wow.  Every one of these is  a gem.  Makes the stuff I work on look pretty shabby by comparison. What's this? She lifts up Lorna's birthday gift -- still unwrapped.Todd reacts  -- he forgot to get rid of it -- and Sarah reacts to Todd. Obviously, not for me. Maybe we can find out whose it is. Inside is a silver bracelet, and a hand-written note. (reading) "Lorna.  Remember, I'm in your corner.  Love, Terri."  Pretty  cool bracelet.  You just found this. Lorna.  That's a name you don't hear very much.  Lorna.  Like  the cookie. Terri and Lorna.  Sisters, maybe?  Lovers, more like it.  Or...witches. Or...perhaps Terri killed Lorna, and this "gift" provides her  with an alibi. What, aren't you a little curious? Todd pulls over and stops. I want it to work, too. (off his look) Oh.  Is this about sex? What?  Get it over with? Don't you think it's better to be sure of each other first?   To have a little bit of trust? I know, I know. (beat) But you're not sleeping with anyone else, right? It's not such a strange thing to ask.  Sometimes relationships...overlap. You haven't asked me if I'm seeing anyone. It's silly, I know, but it makes me feel like you couldn't imagine  anyone being interested in me. Hmm.  Ask me, anyway. Absolutely not. Todd takes the bracelet, puts it on the dash, then leans to kiss  Sarah. I do want to make love tonight. I think spontaneity is overrated. Todd, the light. He switches it off.  They sit side by side and undress down to  their underwear.   They look at each other. Wait.  Don't say anything. What were you going to say? Oh. No, don't say that.  Let's get under the covers. They climb into bed and move into each other's arms. Let's go slowly. They kiss, caress, shedding their inhibitions. Then-- Oh.  Oww! Dammit...my foot.  I've got one of those...what's the word? Not a bunion.  A spasm. Oww!  No, stop!  It hurts!  I hate this! Nothing, it's fine, it's fine.  Lemme just walk it off. She gets out of bed and hobbles into-- I am so embarrassed.  Trust me, this doesn't happen all the time. Todd!  Shhh... Todd stops.  Everything stops. These walls, they're paper-thin.  This building is so poorly  built.  Everyone can hear you. Yes, the walls are...What are you saying? Of course, I am.  I'm sorry if I'm not vocal enough for you. There's no right or wrong way to do this. Todd, I don't expect you to do everything right the first time...Sorry,  that didn't come out the way I meant it... No, I didn't say that.  I was just...Let's be still for a while. Everyone expects fireworks the first time you do it.  But that's  just a myth. Let's not be too hard on ourselves. Our expectations were a little high, that's all. Todd nods his agreement. True.  What do you mean? Right. (beat) There's got to be something else. And they stare at the ceiling. Morning, Pappy.  How's she doing today? They keep telling me I'm doing fine, that I'm even improving.  protect me from? Maybe they know something you don't. Like hell. She pulls out a pack of American Spirit cigarettes and lights  one.  Sarah reacts. Nan. What?  One in the morning with coffee.  One at night with cocktails. Oh, please. Your story, that's the one I want to hear. I wish I had a story to tell. Hmm.  The last time there was talk of an admirer. All you want is dirt, Nan.  Admit it. The world is made of dirt, Sarah.  So, please, dish.  No detail  is too small. I...I'm sleeping with two different men. Hmm.  Continue. One of them is a good man.  He's good for me. Like vitamins. Sort of.  The other one, he can be a complete ass.  A total jerk. In other words...he excites you. He does.  And I hate it.  I hate him.  And, on top of that, I  can't have him. Can you see your Pappy? Sarah looks back over her shoulder.  She catches a glimpse of  her Grandfather.  He's still on the front porch. He hasn't moved. Good.  Keep an eye on him. Why? Because I'm going to tell you something he shouldn't hear.  Something  no one knows.  Once, I had two lovers.  One was your grandfather.  and people would look at us and say, "Now, there goes a couple."  And I liked that. Don't worry.  He's not moving. The other man -- he was a boy, really -- he had no prospects.  certainly had no respect for my virginity.  And I liked that,  too. But I had to make a choice.  I chose your grandfather.  The day  before the wedding, I went to let the other boy down.  Met him  by a river where we used to swim.  Well, one thing led to another,  and when I returned home that night, I'd left my virginity back  in the tall grass by that river. But I did bring something back.  A bite mark.  That sonuvabitch  left on my neck, the size of a peach pit. Did Pappy see it? He did and he didn't.  On the wedding night -- in this house  -- I managed to squeak by.  It was dark.  We were shy.  He took  me in his arms and said, "I'm glad you waited for me."  In other  words, I lost my virginity twice in the same week. No small feat. It's an accomplishment.  But the next morning, your Pappy saw  it.  He demanded an explanation.  And, Sarah, do you know how  I got out of that pickle? You lied. Damn right.  I said, "What, you don't remember giving me this?"  He said, "No."  And I said, "Well, you were so fired up last  night, it's a wonder you can remember anything." And you've never been tempted to... What?  Come clean with your Pappy?  Why should I tell him?  He  had nothing to do with it. Right. It's mine.  Not his. I wonder what became of that boy. Never saw him again.  I don't regret a thing, if that's what  you're wondering. I was, in fact. Look what I have.  I have you. (beat) And you know what else?  I have the tall grass by that river.  really beautiful that day. I don't believe it.  You're actually asking my opinion.  You  really want to know what I think? (shrugs) Boo. You'd have to pay me to live in that neighborhood. (off his look) Hey, what do I know?  I'm just the assistant. To paraphrase you, this is going to give them a major hard-on. Done.  Dom Perignon.  Fifteen cases. A messenger is meeting us at the site with the proofs. Stop it. Have you never heard of the phrase "impulse control"? They reach the elevators. People are starting to notice, Josh.  I work very hard to act  completely indifferent toward you.  The least you could do is  to keep your hands to yourself. What? Josh, just for the sake of variety, could you take me seriously  for a moment? Please, don't... Yes.  I think we should. Josh didn't expect this.  The elevator arrives.  He steps aboard  and holds the door for her. I'm going to take the stairs. Josh shrugs and lets the doors close. A beat.  Sarah considers the stairs, then hits the down button  again. I can't put my finger on it...I just don't feel it's happening  with us. I do.  I mean, I did.  It's no one's fault.  It's chemistry. Do you want your pickle?! I'm sorry.  It's just not happening for me. (into phone) I don't care if it costs the same, if it's not Dom Perignon tell  them we don't want it, alright?...Good.  Anybody else call?   Nobody, huh...Okay. Guess I'll be heading back... (shrugs) No.  None. No.  In fact, I want to thank you. For sparing me from the most unhealthy relationship I've ever  had in my life.  For that, I thank you. Are you having seconds thoughts? Let's seal the deal.  Shake. It's a little awkward, but they do. What? Oh, the bed.  Let's put it against this wall.  Away from the  morning sun. Not enough height for bunk beds. There has to be.  They need to keep each other company. Definitely not enough space for two people to cook. Oh, no.  I wouldn't put the ottoman there. It needs to go over... She waves her hand, accidentally brushing against Josh's chest. Hmmm. We have another problem. What do we do with the elephant in the room? We shouldn't be rude to an elephant. She lets her hand drop to his crotch. They can get very annoyed...if you ignore them. She pulls Josh to her and kisses him.  Josh fairly attacks her,  his hands all over her body. Josh.  The door. It's an absurd request -- the room is completely exposed, but  Josh carries her to the front door and kicks it closed. It was, wasn't it? (beat) Closure is important. jOSH Now you can move on.  You can meet someone who... sarah What?  Someone who's not a prick like you. Josh reacts -- slightly offended. joSH No.  Someone who's...free. sarah Oh.  Right. (beat) As if that would have made any difference in this...what is this  thing called again?  A relationship? Still dressed in the clothes she wore earlier.  She holds a small  paper bag. I brought you something. She hands him the bag.  He looks inside. Oh.  Sawdust.  Lots of sawdust at the job site. (beat) Can I come in? Todd puts the bag of pickles on the kitchen counter.  He sees  Lorna's bracelet...and slides it into a trash can. Need some help? Yeah.  You're fucked. Try concealer.  Aisle three. Just put it on.  And call your lawyer. She smiles. Unbelievable. I'm reading a stupid article in a stupid magazine. (ignores this) The whole issue is devoted to famous couples who are breaking  up.  Listen to this...Remember the blonde doctor on that show  you hate? She's breaking up with her husband of twenty years.  Said a friend,  "Her show's in syndication, she's thin, she's rich and she wants  to play." Josh dries his hands. It's comforting, reading about these broken marriages. Josh opens the door into the-- It's not enough for our marriage to succeed.  Everyone else's  must fail. What? No.  There's no need to talk, because there's no problem. He gets into bed next to her. You don't have to apologize.  There's nothing wrong with the  slump we're going through.  In fact, it's a good thing. Too much passion can ruin a marriage.  Look at Eric and Sylvia.  at the genitals.  And, then...total burn-out.  A marriage cannot  sustain that kind of intensity.  It's good for people to grow  bored with each other.  That way, they can meet and fall in love  again. In case you hadn't noticed...I'm trying to seduce you. You're welcome to reciprocate. Josh turns on the light and sits up. It's alright. Rub my feet. He does. I think we should have an affair. With each other. You pick me up at a bar... (ignores him) Or we could meet at a hotel.  I'll register under my maiden name. When I met you, you were a college boy. Alright.  Bad example. (rethe foot rub) You can stop. I love you, too. And he turns out the light again. Who said there was a problem? Your lovely assistant is here. (reTodd) You didn't tell me she had a new boyfriend. Hey, you two.  Todd, this is my boss Josh, and his wife Gwen. Sarah, you look great.  You've been keeping my boy on his best  behavior? It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it. I know he asks to go above and beyond the call of duty. He can be tough. Josh, I'm trying to thank Sarah for all the extra attention she  gives you. You're welcome. We should really have you over for dinner, Sarah.  It's been  too long.  You can bring... Sorry.  I'm hopeless when it comes to names. Hey, I'm still working on the first, thank you. (to Todd) So, are you two living together? We've only known each other a few weeks. Josh reacts -- he knew nothing of this. You two seem to fit.  It only took me a few days to know with  Josh.  In fact, I knew after the first date. You knew what? That he was the one for me. (to Gwen) Don't stop.  I want to hear about this first date. Well, it was the cheapest date I've ever been on. Do you know the Chinese place on Third?  That little hole-in-the-wall? Really?  I think our first dinner cost a grand total of ten dollars. It was a momentous night.  Babe, we should really go back there. You missed the on-ramp. Why? We don't have to do this tonight. We can't go in here.  Everything's different. He opens the door for her. Sarah's a very interesting girl.  Did you know she's training  for the marathon? What do you want to talk about, then? (flustered) But I thought you were over this place.  And, look...There's  nothing left.  Not one remnant of our first date...anywhere. You're supposed to wait-- (reading) "You will have a change of plans"...in bed. Josh reacts, opens a third. Hmm.  That's what I've heard. No.  You open it. He slowly cracks in open. Blank...in bed.  That's disappointing. What? (off his smile) Oh, my name. She glances across the street.  A shop window sign reads, "Bail  Bonds." My name is Gail.  Gail Bonds. Hmm.  On one condition. That you tell me your name. Is it true what they say, Bill, about billionaires?  That all  the wealth is just a way to compensate...for size? I can imagine.  It must be so lonely at the top. He reaches between her knees. What are you doing? We're not in a bed. Color.  That's the problem with this room, it needs color.  Think  of...the vibrant colors of Haiti. Personally, Haiti does nothing for me.  When your father and  I were there -- this was before you were born, I almost died  from a piece of lettuce, and I wouldn't want anything to remind  me of that trip. Alright.  I didn't say anything. Because you're not sure? No, I'm sure.  I'm sure he's sleeping with her. (beat) And I may have to kill him. Hmm. What?  You think I should just forget about it? Yes, I do. Mother, don't you think honesty is essential in a marriage? It depends.  It can be quite detrimental. Gwen begins to pace in exasperation. Alright.  Confront him.  You know where it will get you.  Your  whole marriage will unravel, and you'll have nothing.  All the  things you take for granted -- month-long vacations in St. Lucia  -- they'll disappear.  You'll be a divorced woman in her late  30s.  Lonely. Why did I invite you over?  You make me feel like shit. That's my job. The phone rings. The machine can get it. I don't monitor calls.  It makes me feel like I'm hiding in my  own home. Pick up the phone. Gwen just stares at the machine. Wow. How long has it been? College. Have you ever seen his show?  It's absolutely dreadful.  I never  miss it. If Josh isn't home, I'll watch it. Hmm.  It's Kismet, then. What? A brief liaison with an old flame.  The perfect way to deal with  your anger. You're insane.  You're an insane mother. It'll be good for your self-esteem. Did it occur to you that maybe he just wants to have coffee? "Coffee...or something."  He's flirting, admit it.  Coffee...or  something. He's stammering.  He's nervous.  He's calling out of the blue! You're wrong.  I'm right, and I'm going.  But take a tip from  someone who's been there.  Opportunity is knocking, Gwen.  You  have a chance to level the playing field. Yes? About what? Oh.  I'm glad you think so. She leans closer to inspect a new wrinkle. One. Then...two. She hands him the card. I'd like to pay in cash. Two, please. I'm surprised they weren't all over you. What did they say? See?  Those women are happy you're not doing Shakespeare. Beat. I don't think I'm MALIBU NIGHTS material. You look like you enjoy kissing them. Hmm.  Someone else in particular? If she's as tan as you, I don't want to hear about it. David reaches for his wallet. Well...Let's start with the man, upper left. Okay.  And the boy? And when did you...? No.  But fifteen years ago...That was right after-- Was I the last woman? David nods. Was I that bad? David laughs. Nothing.  I'm very happy for you.  And, I have to confess, I'm  relieved. Oh -- what the hell -- we're friends, right? I had this ridiculous idea that you wanted to get together to  have a... You know...for old time's sake. And, frankly, I wasn't looking forward to turning you down.   Which I would have, of course.  Had you...asked.  Which you're  not, because you're...you're... Right. Right. She slides her empty glass toward him. Would you pour me a little more, David? I'd like to check out. Yes.  I was stood up...by the past. Beat. No, you don't understand. No.  I need the room after all. (beat) Will you show me the way there? The Desk Clerk looks at her with no apparent interest. No. Fine. I suppose. No. He takes her in his arms. I'll be fine. (beat) This could get you in trouble.  You could lose your job, right? You don't even know me. We have nothing in common. Beat. Thank you for taking care of the room. ...And now the score is tied...Oh my God, what will I tell my  mother?  I did it with a desk clerk.  Hardly the affair to remember...Of  course, she will disapprove.  "Is English even his first language?  field?  You don't even know the boy's name--" What's your name? What?  You're kidding me. Gwen laughs -- she can't help it. Nothing, it's just-- She laughs even harder.  The elevator door opens.  David gets  out and looks at her oddly. Sorry, I just...I didn't think you'd be named David. You weren't going to return my calls. Is there somewhere we can talk? The desk phone rings.  David picks it up. Is there somewhere we can talk? Privately. I want you to be there on Sunday. You told me we'd always be friends. You're an important part of my life, David.  There's so much  history between us.  I don't want to trash it simply because-- The four of us? Stop it. But he's on a roll-- It's okay. Oh.  David Freeman.  He's not coming. Jerry reacts. No.  He's not. Yes, I talked to him.  And I... (to Wedding Planner) Would you excuse us for a minute? I talked to David.  And...I uninvited him. I told him it wasn't right.  I told him he shouldn't be at our  wedding. I don't know...I just realized I don't want our wedding to be  about where I've been.  I want it to be about where you and I  are going. Jerry... He was disappointed-- But he understands.  I drew the line, honey. I did it for us. Rosalie gives him a kiss. Were you sleeping? Liar.  You're practicing.  I can hear you. He moves to the window. It's so sad.  Why do you always play sad songs? Please let me in. You don't trust me? I'm going to wait here for one minute.  Sixty seconds. Then, I'm gone.  You won't see me again. She hangs up.  He hangs up. Fine.  I'll talk... A beat. The reason I won't just leave you alone is not because I'm "confused."  that I can love Jerry and love you.  And that one love has nothing  to do with the other.  But it's true. What? Why? That's it? Don't be so mean. David flashes an angry look.  Then, he pulls Rosalie close to  him. What do we do? Stop... She kisses him.  He engulfs her in his arms. I don't know how... David, will you hand me my shampoo?  It's in my purse. David opens Rosalie's purse and finds a travel-size bottle of  shampoo. Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the  fruit of thy womb Jesus...Holy  Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour  of our death, Amen...Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the  fruit of... Hey... Late. He looks at the time. Oh.  The girls.  Wedding talk.  We could've gone on all night. Jerry... We need to make love now. I can't explain it.  We just need to make love now. He nods.  He kisses her neck, her breasts. Suddenly she stops him, taking his face in her hands. I just need to fix this moment in my mind. A long beat.  She studies his face. I love you.  Totally.  Completely.  I don't want to spend another  minute of my life without you. No, I'm not. He laughs uncomfortably. No, I don't.  Let's not use it tonight. (beat) I'm ready. A beat. Jerry? Talk to me... Husband and wife.  Definitely. Jerry simply nods. That could be tough.  For him. The Priest feigns amusement. Sitting on the bed in a tank-top and a short skirt.  As fetching  as ever. You must be the groom. Jerry laughs. The guys were right.  You're a looker. All the better.  I like challenges. She crosses to face him. Getting married tomorrow, huh? Love, honor, and obey.  That's the drill, isn't it? Tomorrow...So, technically, this doesn't count. You can't break a vow you haven't taken, can you? I've done my share of lawyers.  They spend most of the hour negotiating  the tip. Something bothering you? Want my philosophy?  If we don't make mistakes now and then,  how are we ever going to learn from them? I've done a few of them, too. Lousy tippers.  They spend most of the hour feeling bad about  what they're doing.  But they do it anyway.  Then, they shortchange  you on the tip.  One of them absolved me once, before he left. The guys who can least afford it.  Guys with families. Hands-down.  Politicians. Jerry reacts. Sure.  Both parties.  I don't discriminate.  Besides, a penis  doesn't know from politics.  A penis is the most politically  incorrect part of the body.  It has a simple agenda. Don't worry about it. Hey, it's no sweat.  I get paid either way. That was smart.   Now, you're bleeding.  Here... She takes him by the arm into-- Better? Do you love her? C'mon.  Let's sit down. They return to-- I wouldn't know. What's wrong with a little approval? Jerry gives her a hard look. (lets him off the hook) Professional. Huh. A beat. I don't see what the big deal is.  I play roles all the time. Lorna.  And I'll do whatever the hell I want. Sure.  I do. She gets up and crosses to the window.  Lifts it up. Here's your chance. It's not too far a drop to the lawn.  You have gas in your car? See?  Easy. She sits on the bed, takes in the room.  It seems ordinary and  strange, all at once. (to Waitress) Mind if I have that? I just want the crossword puzzle. The Waitress puts the paper in front of her.  It falls open to  the Metro section, where Lorna sees a photo of Jerry and Rosalie  -- the one Todd shot. Oh my... The Waitress cranes her neck to see. Hello...It's the oldest condition known to man.  Cold feet. You're wrong.  I'm telling you he's two states away by now. If you're wrong, you're paying for drinks tonight. Well, what do you know... Lorna can't believe it -- she almost feels betrayed. Told you we should've dressed up. C'mon...we're going inside. What for?  Wait... But Lorna is bounding toward the cathedral. Lorna, we shouldn't be here. Hearing her name Todd looks up.  Then, he gathers his gear and  starts inside. Excuse me, could you tell me who's getting married in... (beat) Hey, I know you.  The wedding guy. Yeah.  You don't remember me? Right.  I must be thinking of someone else.  Sorry. What was that all about? Nothing. Nothing, my ass. Alright, alright.  I slipped. Slipped?  You broke the cardinal rule of the trade. (pedantic) Never acknowledge a client in public. What is this?  Hooking For Dummies?  C'mon... Lorna grabs Terri by the wrist and slips into-- I'll bet that dress is Vera Wang. Shhh... Jerry and Rosalie turn to face each other. I do. You're crying, I can't believe it. No, I'm not. (beat) Weddings make me cry. The congregation applauds.  Jerry shakes hands with the best  man -- his Father.  He gives his son an approving pat on the  back. We're with the groom's party. She had his cock in her mouth last night.  Doesn't that count? I don't know why he came back. (beat) It wasn't love. Guess you'll never know for sure. They start down the sidewalk-- Remember the guy I told you about -- the writer? Yeah.  He said he wanted to immortalize you.  What a line. He's been steady work.  Every Tuesday for the past month.  Well,  get this.  Yesterday, he called and asked me out. On a date? Yeah.  A date. A non-paying date. No money will be exchanged.  You want to hear the weird part? You're right.  That is weird. You gotta keep an open mind, Lorna. (beat) You never know with people. They wait at the crosswalk.  Lorna idly glances at the window  of a brownstone apartment. C'mon, what are you waiting for?
