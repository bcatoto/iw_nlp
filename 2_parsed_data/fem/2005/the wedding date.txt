Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you�re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you�ve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn�t outshine me. But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn�t feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don�t know, but your misery just isn�t working for me anymore. You know what? I�m not having this conversation right now. Hey. So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me. I�m fine. I promise. I should get going. God, Kat! Please. Don�t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me. When I freaked out at the pub? That was nothing, just nerves. Don�t worry about it. The wedding. I am so, so bad! I don�t think I should be allowed to get married. I don�t think I can go through with this. Bacardi 151. Oh, shut up and be happy. It�s always this or that. You�re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin. Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath? But I�m not taking your name, buster. I�m a feminist! I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey! Perfect. All ginny. Exactly! Today�s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day. You know what I love about all this? And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her. If Ed ever found out.... It was such a long time ago. You know all that �if these walls could talk� stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory? What for? Fred Astaire and what�s her face! Jeffrey told her last night. Say something. Please. Whatever you do, don�t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies. Or Edith Piaf.So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave? You and Amy. Reunited. Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her. And Amy wasn�t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you. Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn�t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--. There�s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know. What�s going on with you two? I�m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don�t bake. It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they haven�t made up since. Why should this be any different? Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family. I blame Tony Pee-Pants! Oh, don�t be that way. I�m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces. Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens. I�m not as square as my daughter thinks. Why, with you.Wow. You look beautiful. Sure, disappear. We�ve been walking away our whole lives. Hey. You practically bribed him with your erector set. We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend. I was fourteen. Are you sure you�re okay? What? Why? What do you mean? But I do. I will. You�re my sister. Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about-- Pub Golf? Why don�t you get my half sister her seventh hole? Drunk isn�t the same thing as happy, Amy. Christ, Amy. Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed? Except it�s Scotch. There�s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you? She did? Mom, please. Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants. I was pretty hard on her last night. And now she�s getting married. So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches. She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet. Oh, no. She tells this story at every major holiday. I�d be happy to. You�re welcome. Sir, yes, sir! Mom�s refining her strategy for DDay. Huh? My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks it�s-- Where�s Nick sleeping? I�m sorry? It�s the past. It�s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let�s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu. Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning. But not anymore. Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It�s no big deal. I promise. When we were together I was �too here,� now I�m not here enough. Is this supposed to be an apology? Not for a dog. Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do. So, what�s your point? That was a long time ago. Um, news flash: I don�t give a shit. It�s called character. God, you�re predictable. Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we�re the past. I�m not sure if you noticed, but I�m here with someone else. So, tell me, how�s unmarried life? Maybe not her least... There�s always-- Hey, you! Hey, yourself. I see you�ve met my ex. Yeah? Why, Jeffrey. Hello. Thank you. What?! No, no. You can�t-- Hi. You�re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me. You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don�t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It�s your job. It�s who you are. How would you even know if something were real? You�ve always got that to hide behind, don�t you? It�s just business! He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing. I didn�t say he was worth it. Yeah. Spontaneously combust? What would you do if you weren't an escort? Desperation? So, why�d you say yes to me? You have had girlfriends? I�m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this. He was about to un-stick me! I paid you to help me get closure. Oh, cut the crap! But nothing did. What? And what if I didn�t want you to...to do that to me? So you�re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That�s a down payment on a Ford Focus! Not if you take an advance on your credit card. Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened. Are you sure? Come on. Show me. Subtle? Oh, come on. You�re like the Yoda of escorts. Okay. This is awkward for me. Talking about it makes me feel better. My sixth-grade science project was entitled, �Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.� Trust me, I�m careful. I guess so. What?! So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart. And you thought I�d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries? You shit! Oh, no. Shampoo, got it! If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys. I have a friend at the magazine. Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K. Sorry. I�m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me. Not you. You�re not disgusting. You�re lovely. Just the idea that they�d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn�t...who never.... I mean, someone�s dead. I think that�s disgusting. A wedding. Have you ever done anything like this before? I do? What is? What? Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock. I�m desperate to start but I don�t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can�t get enough of. That won�t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant. No offense. How does it feel to get that much money just for being you? Six thousand, right? I�m compulsive and weird? No, count it, anyway. What does your gut say? What did he say exactly? I mean, you don�t think he wants me back? Of course he is. I�m here with my new man. I love it! Your magic�s already working. Let the suffering begin. Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram�. Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about? Oh, yeah. So we split it. You know, as in �share.� People do that. I don�t do naked. My sister? She does naked. Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm-- Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go! Really? Don�t get too attached. Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, it�s way better to look hot while you�re doing it. Don�t patronize me. They�ve clearly been at this a while. You have feet? Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we�re trying too hard to look like we fit. It�s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere. Hi. Hey. You knew? Dad made me go over and apologize the next day. Therapist. You didn�t have to do that. You have more than one gynecologist? Of course, don�t be silly. Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the tourists. Not exactly. I wear it. On my right hand. And only rarely. Give it back? Are you nuts? I get all the glamour jobs. Hey, Sal. Yeah. It�s complicated, Dad. That�s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back. Good morning. Meet Nick. Dad! She�s drunk. -er than me. But I didn�t really dump you, did I? I haven�t thought about that in years. I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal? �...but it�s getting there. � I�m worried. Amy�s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker? Is it �drunker� or �drunker-er�?
