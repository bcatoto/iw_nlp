<i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i> <i>Where do you want to meet?</i> <i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i> <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i> <i>$300,000.</i> <i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i> Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night. <i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i> <i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i> <i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i> I don't know. They might be dead already. <i>The FBI was breathing down Lateesha's neck... and she assumed that they were onto our scam. So she set up some college kids to take the fall for the heist. They have been under FBI surveillance for the past 6 months.</i> <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN </b> Claremont drives like a maniac. <i>The system hasn't been updated.</i> You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad. I'm pulling up right now. Evacuate the fucking van! Plans have changed! <b> EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole. I've already formulated a plan. She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there! <i>The money exchange will take place at Top of the World at the Stratosphere. Get there at exactly midnight.</i> <i>The combination code is tattooed on his right arm. You'll never get inside Edna Fender's safe without the code-breaker on that arm.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear. <i>Deliver them to the Needles DMV. Sundown at the Sam Kinison monument.</i> <i>Did you get all four?</i> You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.<i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i> What is it, Choco? Who the hell is that? <i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i> <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i> Morning. I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner. Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die. Okay. What!!? You're breaking up... I can't hear you. <i>What happened to them?</i> Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four. I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you. I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man. Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter? Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table. <i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i> Take us to Vegas. Show me the tapes. I want to see them. <i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i> <i>Her car was in the shop.</i> We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. <b> INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY </b> That's the rumor on the street. He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss. He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch. Yes. You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror. I don't know. <i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i> <i>Mescaline.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NIGHT </b> Domino and the others are all drinking coffee. Alf stares out through the windshield at the GLOW of Vegas in the distance. <i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i> Is that the decoder? Turn over your weapon, Edna! HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA! Nice to see you again, Edna. Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch! <i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i> <i>It was the beginning of the end.</i> He used to date Pat Benatar! It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter. Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation? Cunt. Cunt. I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband. Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me. The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode. Everything. It is a ghastly existence. <i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television. Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way. <i>Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve.</i> <b> INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- [FLASHBACK] TEN MINUTES AGO He said... take his right arm. Something is going down. Something bad. What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them? Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies? You have sixty seconds... here's the question... Which one of you is Frances? YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen. Hello? <i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings. <i>Mum was terrified for me. She didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit.</i> How did you meet Choco? Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?! I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar. Really? Did you play in a band? So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter? No last names. Just Domino. The less you know about me the better, okay? You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino. Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong. And I want to have a little fun. Where the fuck do you think you're going? <i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i> I can certainly think of one more!Cock-fuckers are gonna pay. Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain. Put the money in the safe until we hear from Claremont. <b> Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER </b> LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE! PROVE IT! Is that you, Domino? Chi-Chi! CHI-CHI!Where is Domino? This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is. Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks. Fast and or furious. In theory. We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark. This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television. Okay. Domino Harvey is here.Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast. Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i> <i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i> Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback. You were good.I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka. Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot. There's always a loophole with you, Claremont. Your black ass is one big loophole. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- [FLASH FORWARD] NIGHT What? That bitch called me a bitch.God help us. God help us all. <i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser. So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend? I said stop it. Stop it. Must you use that awful word? Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?! Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold. Be kind to your sitter.No. Please enlighten me. This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know. That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you. Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP] Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY. <i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i> What was your business with Lateesha that day? Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket? Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything. If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time. You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself. Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino? I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is. Where is the money? <i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad. Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
