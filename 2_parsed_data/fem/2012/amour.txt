But who would do something like that? From us? What time is it? Can't we call the superintendent? Or the police? Imagine if we were here, in our beds, and someone broke in. But it's terrible! I think I'd die of fright. I'm tired. Weren't those semiquavers in the presto incredible? What staccato! Don't you agree? No. (who comes back to the table with the egg) I hope so. The last time, he kept us waiting for ages, if you remember. (more to herself) Really? What are you doing? You left the water running. What did you say? What joke? I don't get it! Why are you talking to me like that? What's got into you? What game, for Christ's sake? What on earth's the matter?!! To what? When? Please tell me what's wrong. What am I supposed to have done? But what DID happen? When... When was it? So...?? Help? Yes. Because you left it on. I don't understand. Why? What can he do? I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me. But what DID happen? I'm here. I'm having my breakfast, and you're telling me things happened that I don't understand. No, I can't! You did! (more and more desperate, close to tears) No I can't! Do you want to torture me? Leave me in peace! No! You know how he is. Once he's got something into his head, he has to go through with it. In the end, everybody was delighted. And besides, it didn't hurt our financial situation. We're playing until the 28th. Then we have 10 days to rest, then we go to Stockholm for four days, and then to Kumo in Finland. Heaven knows where that is. At the North Pole. But Geoff's already been there few times, and he loves it. We're playing the "Dowland Transcriptions" there and then we're back in London. Liz is at boarding school and John is living his own life. He's twenty- six years old. He's a student. We rarely see him. He's got his own ideas. Life Geoff. They don't really get along. Geoff wants to advise him on everything, and John doesn't like that at all. I think so. He's less impulsive. Very industrious. No!! He's not like Geoff. Quiet, but stubborn. I think he'll do all right. At the last Conservatory concert, he played the solo part in the Haydn Concerto. It was very good. Geoff was there and congratulated him at the end. What do you mean? (with a little laugh) My God, you know him, don't you? Over the winter, he suddenly discovered his passion for a viola player who'd been in our ensemble for years. What can I tell you? It was a huge drama, and the poor little darling wound up trying to commit suicide. That scared him and he came back to me in full remorse. I've got used to it now. What's a bit embarrassing is that the ensemble, you can't keep any secrets from anyone. Yes, I think so. What's aphasia? And what do they say now? I'm so sorry. What can I do for you? (with a little laugh) It's funny. I don't know if I should say it. Maybe it'll embarrass you. But when I came here a short while ago, I suddenly remembered how I always used to listen to the two of you making love when I was little. For me, at the time, it was reassuring. It gave me a feeling that you loved each other, and that we'd always be together. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Mery. Thank you. Yes, thanks. In the living room. (with a faint smile) First come sit with me. Can you help me into the chair? It's best if you put my arm around your neck and your right arm around me, that way it'll be easy. Thanks. (in a voice just as soft) Me too. Promise me one thing. Please never take me back to the hospital. You promise? You promise? Don't talk right now. And don't give me any lectures. Please. Nothing. Just don't say anything. Thank you. Thank you, Darling. Everything's fine. You don't have to hold my hand all the time now. I can look after myself, you know. And don't feel guilty. That would be pointless. And a drag. For me too. That's good. Go over there now. I'm not a cripple. You can easily leave me alone for two minutes. I won't collapse. Did you buy the new book on Harnoncourt? And? Sure. Don't worry. It isn't that important. (taking the book) Thanks. Right now, take care of yourself. And don't wait to see how I hold the book in my hand, OK? Unfortunately the strawberries were already moldy. I'll go and get you some fresh ones tomorrow from the market. My husband will bring you the bottled water this afternoon. I'm not supposed to carry anything heavy: my back, you know... It came to 76 euros and 40 cents. There's the till receipt and here's your change: 23 euros 60. Thank you, sir. Is your wife well? ... Fine. Give her my regards. My husband and I are very glad she's back. Goodbye, sir. So? How did he react? That's cute. Why didn't you ever tell me before? Aha...? Don't tell me you're going to ruin your image in your old age? Sometimes you're a rotter. But you're nice. Listen to this! My horoscope. Motto: You have lots of verve, but need to be more serious! Love: High-class conversation is what you need. Work: You're motivated again. But proceed with care. Health: Loosen up by doing exercises. It'll give you renewed pizzazz. You have to go. Who does like going to funerals? You're mean. What would you say if no one came to your funeral? Have you talked to Jeanne since I was in the hospital? I mean, does she know I can't come? What did she say? How? Sorry. Do I talk about it all the time? Don't worry. (once she's seated in the Forgive me, I was too slow. Can you wheel me into the living room? Yes. Why are you home earlier? That's true. How was the funeral? How was it, go on, tell me! There's just no point in going on living. I know it can only get worse. Why should I inflict it on us? On you and me. You don't have to lie, Georges. Of course I did. But imagination and reality have little in common. Georges, I don't want to carry on. You're making such efforts to make everything easier for me. But I don't want to go on. For my own sake. Not yours. I don't know. I can't be bothered to think about being you. I'm tired. You tire me. Everything tires me. I can't talk. I want to go to bed. Martin! What a delight. How lovely to see you! Don't get up. Come on, sit yourself down and don't look so shocked. I'm so proud of you. We were both in raptures after your concert. Georges wanted to buy your new CD the very next morning. No, no, don't worry. We want to make a contribution to your success. Even if it's only twenty euros. You owe it to your hard work and your talent. My right side is paralyzed, that's all. It can happen when you get older. Let's talk about something else, shall we? Don't be offended. But I want to enjoy the lovely interlude you've given us with your visit. Could you do me a favor? Would you play Fï¿½r Elise? Give it a try. What's the matter? (meekly) I'm sorry. Sorry. Georges? What's going on? Who is it? Georges? What's going on? Georges, what's going on? Calm down will you! There's nothing there. It's nothing. What was it? What was? Why? When is it? I don't want that. Geoff doesn't need to come. I don't need any comments on my predicament. I can only take his British humor in small doses. Stop the CD. Where are the family albums? Can you get them for me? I'd like to look at them. Please! Thanks. That's nice. Life...so long... What a long life... Stop watching me. Of course you were. I'm not that dumb yet. What do you mean? I can't... take it any more. ... thinking about whether it wouldn't be better to invest the money in an apartment block. If inflation gets going again, property is the only sure thing. Right now, savings accounts pay 1.75% at best. Four years ago, Geoff bought some stocks with a small sum of money and the whole thing collapsed. So now we're obviously worried. Unfortunately, in the meantime, other people have had the same idea, and property prices are going through the roof. Since we came back from Scandinavia, I spend all my spare time looking through newspaper ads. It takes time, that's all. We'll find something in the end. (slowly) Yes yes I have... I have... the grandmother... woman with house... not... the house then ... money I don't understand you, I'm afraid. ... yes... now... it's all... house sel... sel... sel... was... in two strokes of... so quickly... god it's hard... to say... sell... money gone... left... there too... She only talks gibberish. I don't know what... Nothing is OK. What's going on, actually? You can't just leave her lying on her bed like that! She's unrecognizable! It's ridiculous! What does that mean, "no other options"? Why isn't she in a hospital? I can't believe that these days there's no way of handling this efficiently. I didn't say that. I'm simply questioning whether what I see going on here is the answer to everything! Like what? OK... ...Mom to the concert... ...Mom to the concert... no dress... ...Mom to concert... no ... uuu... no... (in a monotone) Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!... ... we could take turns. She'd come from 8 till 12 and I'd do 2 until 6, or 3 to 7. That would certainly relieve the pressure on you. She just has to know in time so she can arrange it in her schedule. Very well. I have to go now... Thanks for the coffee. You mustn't take it too seriously. Usually they always say something. She might just as well say "Mom, Mom, Mom". It's just mechanical. Goodbye, sir. (softly) ...Help...Help... ... Ssssur... po ... pont ... sss ... Ssssur le pont ... ... ssur... le .. ... as you wish, sir. I don't know what you were expecting. I gave up another job to come and work here. You should have thought it over before deciding whether you wanted a second nurse or not. What's that supposed to mean? No one has ever complained. (after a brief calculation) Seven hundred and eighty euros. I've never had anything like this happen to me before. Who do you think you are?! I've been doing this job for ten years. I don't need you to teach me how to do it. No. You're a nasty old man. I feel sorry for you. Go fuck yourself, you old fart! Help... help... (softly) Help... Help... Help... Help... It's me. (a bit irritated) Yes. Hello. What was going on? What's going on with Mom? Well... (gesture toward the What's going on with Mom? Why don't you answer the phone? After our last conversation, I left four messages on your answering machine. Why don't you call back? Don't you realize we're worried? Dad... Dad, what's the matter? I... Tell me, what's going on? Have you gone crazy? I don't want to sit down. What's going on here? You can't stop me from seeing her. It's me, Mom. Can I do something for you? Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Thanks. What's going to happen now? You can't go on like this, Dad. Can't we have a serious talk, you and me? (in a rush)... short... short dress... only I... only I... all long... it was... (with a small gesture to imitate a bell): ding... dong... (still rushed) ... yes... to ... fro ... you... very serious... like that... (she imitates a serious countenance, continues in a low voice): like that... serious... (smiling) yes... up... tight... ... it was n...nice... (loud) Help... Help... Help... Help... Help... I'm almost done. You can put your shoes on if you want. Thanks. Aren't you taking a coat?
