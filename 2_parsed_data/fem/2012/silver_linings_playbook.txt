I don't want him to get used to the routine here. Eight months is already long enough. What? I don't understand. (into cell phone) Hello? (into cell phone) Yes, it is. (into cell phone) What? Are you sure about that? I'll bring him back right away. You lied to me, Pat. Danny's not allowed to leave. Don't tou-... ...-ch the steering... Pat, this whole thing was a mistake. I am out on a limb for you with the courts right now. Well, he's ready. Look at him. Don't worry about that. The court said yes. Don't worry. Don't worry. It's all under control. It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat. Pat, you owe us an apology. Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy. You have to go. It's part of the deal. You can't live with us and not go. I will call them. They'll come for you. You've gotta take your medication. Why are you wearing a garbage bag? He says you're good... ..luck, honey. I'm making crabby snacks and homemades. That's him. Yeah, that's the one. Pat, don't look for Nikki! Pat! Don't look for Nikki! Oh, God! Oh, God! What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. I got it. I got it. I got it. You know I can't tell you that. But Doug Culpepper is still here. You know, you look good. Did you lose a lot of weight? Get away from me! Get away! You just have to give it some time. You know, a lot went down. People will get over it. It'll be all good. It'll work out. Good luck. Ronnie! What are you doing? Did you invite him? Well, can he make it? Get in here, please. I need you. Pat! You mean rookie of the year? DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson? (noticing Pat) Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner. Not for dinner. Oh, that's sweet. (to Pat) That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely. Hey. How did who die? Thank you. Oh, I didn't think you were. I just got fired, actually. Does it really matter? Baby, how's it going? Everyone having fun? We're gonna go on a tour now. We're gonna go on a tour now. Let's go see the house. Guess what it is. It's a computer screen. Just keep going, keep going, keep going. It's a light. It's a... Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer. ...it's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde. Don't think so hard, don't think so hard. It's a joke! It's a...fireplace. In the middle of the wall? We have a port in every room. Gimme an iPod. Who, who doesn't have an iPod? Gimme your iPod. Give it to me. Thank you, baby, thank you. Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in, I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom. Look, look, look. I can play music for the baby in any room. No. No, I don't. Oh. Klonopin? (Chuckling) Yeah. Jesus. Trazodone! God, I bet it does. I'm tired. I wanna go. No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we haven't even finished the salad yet, or the duck. I made the Fire and Ice cake. I said I'm tired. (to Pat) Are you gonna walk me home or what? Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home? I have a problem? You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things. You scare people. What? I'm not telling the truth? You can drive them both home. Now. Stop talking about me in third person. You can take Tiffany home first. You love it when I have problems. You love it, Von, because then you can be the good one. Just say it. No... ...I don't. I don't. I just wanted to have a nice, I just wanted to have a nice dinner. Oh, God. What is your problem?! Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm tired and I wanna go. (to Pat) Come on, are you ready? You really, you really wanna go right now? Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great. Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye. This is me. Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works. I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay? Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital. You're married? So am I. Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey, is that make-up on your shirt? Pat! What is it? What about in your father's study? It's probably in the attic. Please stop yelling! Pat! Pat! Calm down, Pat. Pat! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Pat! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop hitting him! Stop hitting him! It's a medication problem, but he's fine now. What? Jesus Christ, who's that? Hey! Who was at the door? Hey! What happened to your face? That sounds like bullshit. Why'd you run by my house? Did our little conversation get you upset last night? This is my neighborhood. You just ran by my house. Me too. What? Me too! I like this road. This is my neighborhood. Calm down, crazy. Hey! So am I! Where is your wife? I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital in Baltimore. I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore. There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself. Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?! Can you forgive? Are you any good at that? Hey! I wanted to clarify something. I just want us to be friends. (Pat doesn't answer) Did you hear what I said? (Pat doesn't answer still) Why are you giving me such a hard time? I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit. Pick me up at seven thirty. Hi. Thank you. Tea. Thanks. Thank you. Why did you order Raisin Bran? Because you ordered Raisin Bran. It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran. It's good. How's your restraining order? And the so-called incident with the weights. I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister. I heard about that. Wow. Yeah. You do. Me too. Yeah, let's get back to the letter. Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that. You think that I'm crazier than you. Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me. You know what? Forget I offered to help you. Forget the entire fucking idea. `Cause that must have been fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you. I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband! Forget it! Fuck you! You shut the fuck up! Yes, you do. You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you? Just leave me alone! You may not have experienced the shit that I did. But you loved hearing about it, didn't you? You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened up to you and you judged me. You are an asshole. You are an asshole! Get off of me! (yelling) Get off! You're harassing me! He's harassing me! Get off! It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh]. He didn't do anything, it was all the kids. You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's just a song. Don't make it a monster. There's no song playing. There's no song. Breathe, count backwards from ten. That's it. That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I took it too far. No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started. I know, I have a stupid sense of humor. Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry. Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part. I know. I know you didn't mean it. I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time. I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry. I know you do. Yeah, sure. Maybe we should call the FBI. "Do not go in my study or I will eat you!" What's in the envelope? What do you want with her? She's not here. Go away. I can't, I can't do it. I can't give the letter to Nikki. Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me? I know. Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing! I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get what I want, okay? I'm not my sister. I can't do it. There's this thing. It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing. It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year. Would you please! Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my goddamn husband is dead? My God. But I can only do it if I have a partner...and now I'm about to miss it for another year. What, your schedule is so busy? "Grapes of Wrath" and watching football with your dad? All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter. Think about it. What? Jordie? Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki? How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it, I wanna understand it. Wow. It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back. So think about the dance thing. What's wrong with your marriage? What's wrong with your marriage? Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him? Pat, you're up to something, I know. Oh, no. I used the insurance money to build this. I designed it. All the floors are hard oak. It has good bounce for dancers. I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It's therapy and it's fun. And the walls are good `cause I can play music really loud without anybody hearing. Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it. You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here. What? Probably tonight. Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight. Mm-hmm. No, that's good, that's really good. Yeah. I mean, I hope so. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous. Yeah. Uh-huh. All right, let's start simple. Start at that corner, walk towards me. Walk across the room. Are you fucking kidding me? A deal is a deal. Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki. And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk. You can't talk. Only walk. Do it. No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on. Don't look up until you're halfway here. That's right. Not yet. Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion. Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died? We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. (pause) That's a feeling. Okay, this is the waltz. I'm gonna teach you the waltz step. Whoa! Slow down. Your father wanted you to have this. It's his living. Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat. Football stays out of this place, so does "Lord of the Flies." I don't give a fuck. What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all about the "Lord of the Flies." It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power. And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining. Hello. Pat told me about you. What? He wrote about me? I'm "the girl"? What'd he say? No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter. Cool. Okay. And then this goes into something else. No. No, please. Bye! Yeah, what is it? What is this project, hon? I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that. These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet. And we don't have a move yet. Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju? Guess what? Nikki replied to your letter. But you can't read it until after you nail the big move. Go. I just hope you can handle it. She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared. Try to stay positive. No. I thought you were gonna read it out loud. (follows him to door) She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her. We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up! Oh, really? There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants. Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look it up. Yeah, "Excelsior." Oh Pat. Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation. I did my research. Thank you. Against the Cowboys. That's your team isn't it, Randy? I know who his team is. December twenty-eight, last game of the season. Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition. Oh God. Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team? No. No, Patrizio-- They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores. We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there. They're good. Some of them are professionals. Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break! You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading the Pat! You are not a stand up guy! Pat! I told you not to push it. You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won't do the dance and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it. There's only one way to get him to show. Oh, what's that? We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there. She won't come. She can't come. We have to tell him that she's coming. But that's a lie! It's a white lie. There's no other way. No. I don't approve. You can't do it. We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there. You gotta be part of it. We have to do it. Aren't you nervous to be lying? Yeah. A little bit. But it's for the best. Okay. Hey. It's fine. Is everything all right? This isn't working! Stupid! This just isn't working! I'm not. I'm focused. Shit. Well, you knew that. Maybe you should've scouted `em. The birds are better when Pat is with me. We settled that. What? I thought you were doing it. I want you to remember everything. I want you to remember all of the good stuff that we have here. Just check in. I gotta go find Veronica. What?! Nikki? Nikki. Oh, Jesus. What the fuck? Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down. You're killing me. You're killing me! Tiffany, please. She'll see how well he's doing, maybe she'll lift the restraining order. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Pat did not say that. He didn't say that. Bartender! Bartender, can I get a vodka, please? Sure. So what do you do? Oh, the arguing kind. Three, two, one! Philadelphia beats Dallas! They are on their way to the playoffs. Where's Tiffany? You gotta find her. I've had two vodkas. We're in what? You know, I used to think that you were the best thing that ever happened to me, but now I think that you might maybe be the worst thing and I'm sorry that I ever met you. Got it. That's really too bad, guys. That's a lot of fours. Thank you! You're amazing! Of course. Good. How are you? You looked really happy out there. Yeah. You look incredible. You lost a lot of weight. Would you just leave me alone?! What the fuck is the matter with you? Give it to her yourself! This is so fucked up. "Dear Tiffany... "...I know you wrote the letter. (long pause) The only way you could meet my crazy...." You wrote that a week ago? You let me lie to you for a week? You love me? Okay. Yeah. For, oh, maybe three hours, plus. Everything's good, everything's good, yeah. I got you, you're all down. (pause) No, Randy, he's complaining. You know he lost a lot of money. He's moaning and groaning. The restaurant's happening because of Randy, so everything's good.
