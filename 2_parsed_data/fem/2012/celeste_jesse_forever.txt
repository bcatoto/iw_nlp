Don't worry `bout me, I've Dont' worry `bout me, I've got a enough love for got enough love, for the two the...(her Blackberry rings) us. Oh please... oh shit, I gotta take this. Turn it down. Jess, turn it down, seriously! She playfully slaps him. He turns it down. A little. (on the phone) Okay. Ready? This year all trends point towards simplicity and comfort. Celeste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of them. (she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone call.(back to her call) That's enough of a blurb, right? Okay. Call me back if they need more. Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Can't you just sit still for two minutes? And we talked about this, no more smoking! Come on. They drive by "Urban Light," Chris Burden's installation at the entrance of LACMA. They are rows of restored street lamps. Celeste sneers. What are you doing? Why are you stopping? Oh wow...you are so thoughtful. Jesse smiles, proud of himself. Jess, that place is insane. They have tassels that were manufactured for Mussolini's mistress... Okay then. (whispers) Did you get the job?? Was that the job? Did you get the book job? What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah. Take me home, it's fine. Be back by six so you can shower. Dinner with Beth and Tucker. Have fun shredding your glassy peel. Love you. They opened for Darcy Fudged His Knickers. Now, they're amazing. You'd be lucky to book them for your wedding. Or you should see if Emergency Breakthrough is available. The horn section is tight. It's already done. We got the best swing band in New England. Sugarfoot and The Swingin' Scrod. I love you. We'll talk about this later. So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet zalad and zeh bolognese, riiiiiiight? I don't vant dessert. I vill joost have bite oof yorrrs. Yawh!!!! I can't do this. I just can't. Are you okay? Oh no... It's just not right. I can't hold my tongue. We can't do this anymore. Honey, weddings are stressful, I know all about it. But you guys we'll be fine! NO. WE are fine. What the fuck are YOU TWO doing?? What do you mean? What do I mean?? You guys are not together anymore! This is not normal! You've been separated for SIX MONTHS and you hang out every day like nothing's wrong! It's fucking weird! No, Tucker, you think it's weird too. Speak up for yourself. No charades. We are separated and we're friends. You guys should be happy, all we did was fight before. Yeah, everyone's cool. Everyone is not cool! This is not cool! It's just not working for me, I'm sorry. Beth gets up and walks out. Celeste and Jesse sit there and stare at Tucker in silence. Yah, she iz uber angry. Yahhh. Ahhhhh! Oh god! They both erupt in laughter. Even though this is the thousandth time they've done this stupid joke, it will always be funny. To them. It's not weird that we hang out. Do you think it's weird we hang out? Yeah you too. I mean, we can't not hang out. The last time we didn't talk for longer than a week was in 10th grade when you went to Space Camp Canada. Well, I'm exhausted. Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight, how's the heat in there? Jesse, please, you can stay here as long as you like. It's your studio. It's actually really nice to have you here. Oh, don't forget, the contractor needs to get in there for measurements in the morning. So make sure your thingys, your sculptures, whatever...are out of the way. Night. Love you too. Excuse me, sir? Did you not? So you did know. And everyone's in a rush, so... Well, it's not just her. It's everyone behind her too. So, if you want to ask all these people if it's okay to cut in front of them because you are late, be my guest. Just don't assume that your time is more important than everyone else's. (sotto) Prick. American culture is dying. We have an unrelenting appetite for processed junk food, talentless pop stars like Riley Banks and recycled movie franchises like Transformers. The more we consume crap, the more we want crap. Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there an upshot? I think there will be a groundswell movement towards simplicity. People will start to listen to their most rudimentary needs-- they will crave mental, spiritual and physical nourishment. It's back to basics. Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks for being with us today. You're great, come back any time. For more on this gloomy but interesting subject, look out for trend forecaster, Celeste Martin's new book "Shitegeist," on bookshelves Monday. Thanks so much, Rachel. So I had dinner with the drama club last night. Tucker and Beth. They're such dicks. They left in protest because they think Jesse and I are being "unhealthy." So judgy, right? We're fine. Spare me the spiritual platitudes, Scotty. If we were gay,(she motions to Scott) no one would even question us being friends! Yeah there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, what do you think? Wait, we're signing Riley Banks?? When were you going to tell me?? I just trashed her on Rachel Maddow. Great. Scott, you and I built this company so we wouldn't have to take an account like Riley Banks. She's like a...soul-less hologram. Ok. Fine. I'm gonna go eat lunch. I don't do dating. The right guy will show up. And I'm still on track for my 25 year plan. First child at 33. Second at 35. Which means I will only be 56 at my eldest's college graduation. The bad news is that I may not be at my 4th grandchild's high school graduation. But that's okay, I guess. I've got time. I'm not worried. What are you doing? Yeah don't. Do you know what you want? Um, wait, where's your wife? You guys are here like everyday together. Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay. I'll go. It's so...grotesque. But kind of beautiful. In a grotesque way. Ugh, let's keep moving. Too many feelings. Beth, the reality is I love Jesse dearly but he doesn't have a checking account. Or dress shoes. The father of my children will have a car. But...Jesse will always be my best friend. Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's your life. But I definitely don't think he should be living in your guest house. I think you're kind of breaking his heart. Slowly. Jesse is fine. Can I show you something? Sure. Okay. Look. What am I looking at? It's a hair. On my NECK. Ewww. Will you get that thing lasered off, please? What the fuck? I can't because it will pop up somewhere else where I can't keep my eye on it. Are you serious? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. It's not a turnip. Trust me, I know my body. It's a cruel land mine. Okay, well at least pluck it for Chrissake. I should, at least before my wedding, right? What is wrong with you? (in pain) AHHHHHHHHHH! Sorry sir, my friend has a really strong emotional reaction to modern art. That was fucking rude. Had to be done. Hey...you're not working? Are you watching the Olympics? Again? And crying? Again? Jesse blows his nose. God, you really love that, don't you? Well, three years ago now but... Uh huh. Hey, did you finish that artwork for the Pop Form website? I'll like it more when I have it because I needed it yesterday, so... Oh. Okay. Does it have something to do with the work you owe me? A date? Really? That is so great. Yeah! Don't cry. Good for you, Jess. Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She's cute! But so young, right? Okay, no need for that. But this is good! You gotta crawl before you walk. I mean she's definitely not gonna be wifey number two, right? Ha. Big move. I'm proud of you. Can I get up now? No, nothing. Are you gonna wear your hair like that? Not weird, just different from how it looks best. There. Better. You'll be great. You don't even need to be great. Just be you. Take her somewhere nice. Call me after? So I was in school but then I dropped out because I really wanted to work in fashion but it's really hard to find a paid internship? So I went back to school and now I work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm really looking to make money doing something I love? But I'm sure the universe is looking out for me and when the time is right, the right thing will come along, you know? Where is it? They told me it would be in new releases... Well you probably shouldn't steal it. Even if it is yours. There. But you don't have the "O" on your cover, you can't do that! Yes I can. Some people are browsing my book. Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ... Yeah, hey. How are you? Thanks, you too. How's your clothes pin collage going? Well, don't give up. Your work is really unique. And beautiful. I hope that doesn't sound... I had a lot of fun too. Oh, this is your book? I read an excerpt online, it's really compelling. Wow, thank you. That is so nice. Well, nice to see you. What is that? Story? Huh. She's pretty. Celeste changes focus again and turns to a Border's employee to loudly and unconvincingly act out "Interested Reader" for other shoppers to hear. I'm in here! Fuck Sweden! It was definitely easier to build the Brooklyn Bridge, I think. Thank you! Perfect. Ruscha meets Basquiat... Yeah. He's a vegan, you know. You're cute. Celeste looks at him. She kisses him. He kisses back. It gets hotter. They fall back. Hey. What are you doing? Okay... Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a bad idea. I'm sorry. Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were drunk, and the dresser and I thought...you're dating other people! Oh no, I thought... Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or I wouldn't have let it happen. Come on Jess, we're not getting back together, you didn't think... Celeste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up and leaves. He turns. Jess! No, I didn't..Jess! Celeste collapses back in the bed. What? Oh. Hi. Celeste keeps walking briskly. PAUL, 35, short but handsome, tries to keep up with her. My practice?? It was...wait, what?...it was fine. (who is this guy?) Are you really doing this right now? You're really doing this right now. Just gonna jump right in there. Wow, Captain Conversation. You bring cards to yoga?? (she looks at the card.) A financial analyst. Cool. No, no I didn't. I'm a trend forecaster. I forecast trends. Paul scoffs at the notion that this is a real career. You traded in your Porsche for an Audi because the economy is tanking and you're afraid you'll lose your job soon. You bought a Samsung cell phone because you think it makes you seem more "business-oriented," unlike the iPhone which is for teenage girls. You go to yoga because you went to a sub Ivy League college, spent the last ten years working long weeks and drinking all weekend and you feel like it's time to do something "spiritual." Nice to meet you, (looks at the card) Paul. Celeste walks away. Paul remains where he is, flummoxed. No, just make sure the San Fran focus group has a little more diversity than last time. It was like a rave. Without drugs. Okay. She hangs up and pauses. Then dials again. I'm glad you called. Jesse smiles big. Hey. It's me. Again. I miss you. Anyway, call me. Okay. Bye. She hangs up, takes a breath and then, to herself: Yeah, I want to talk to you too. Where have you been?? It's been like two weeks. So much to lay down...like, did you know that pay- per-view porn is available in Cantonese? Me too. Wait, you first. Are you gay? (playfully) Oh no, did you go on another date? I don't understand. What do you mean? With another person? Um. What? Sorry, I'm confused. Wait, what? What the fuck? With whom? Veronica?? What's a Veronica? Huh. But that's not even physically possible, that was two weeks ago. Whoa. Okay. Shit. Didn't know about that. But that's not important right now. This is not good. Alright. Okay. You and I are gonna deal with this. We will, we'll just have to. What do you need me to do? But you don't even know this person, right? Make it work?? You slept with her once! What are you talking about? So what you're saying is you got a girl pregnant and now you think you like her because she's pregnant? Or...I'm really confused. Can you excuse me for a second? Celeste gets up and walks slowly to the bathroom. She gently shuts the door. She looks around, not knowing what to do with herself. She focuses on a crack in the wall, she looks closer and then grabs the wall, thinking she might faint. She silently begins to sob, mouth open, eyes shut tight. She collapses on the wall. She is in silent turmoil. Is this really happening? Sorry about that. I had something in my eye. Of course. It was nothing. She forces a smile. Hey. Celeste lets out a guffaw. I'm just following Diddy Twitty. It's Sean Comb's Twitter page. There's also a singing competition on television. It's called American Idol? Keep up. Well, just part of our job, so...ready for breaking news? Jesse is having a baby with some girl. Crazy. It's this girl he slept with once a couple of months ago. And now he's "making it work" with her. Plane crash. No need, Scott, I'm totally fine. Look, I wasn't going to have his baby. So, good for him. Right. Well, let me see...mmmm, nope, I'm fine. I promise. Not in love with him anymore. It kind of makes it easier. The yahoo who did Pop Form's taxes last quarter. He's been asking me out forever. Not the one, but it'll be nice to be admired. Thank you. She hands the menu back to the waiter. OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god, oh no, we just made eye contact. Maybe he didn't see me. Wait, he did. He's coming over. Oh god, this is so awkward.(to Max) You should probably leave. Yeah, just go. Jesse is at the table. Oh, this is Matt. Mack. We're just here. Just eating. It's a date. I'm dating. Who are you here with? Uh huh. Celeste immediately scarfs down her salad which has just arrived. She's quiet. I'm fine! Celeste stares at Jesse at the bar. Nothing. Do you like bread? Cool, cool. Silence, once again. This was great! I'm free next Wednesday? Sushi? Oh, because of mercury poisoning? I think that's a myth. I go to this acupuncturist that... Thank you for your concern but I'm just fine. I guess you're just not a match for me. (sotto) Whatever. Hi honey! Hi, wow, you are really out of breath. Did you fucking run here?? From West Hollywood?? Yeah I ran. Just started. It's really fun. You're soaking wet. Isn't that like 12 miles?? 13.5 actually. I was just clearing my head, you know, keeping the endorphins up. Do you...want to sit down? Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? It's so nice. Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman approaches. I'm so sorry but that's a one-of-a- kind piece that was handwoven by a tribe of Afghani women. So if you could maybe just sit over there? The saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable looking chair. Right. Sorry. Totally. Wow, you are a sweat tsunami. You should get it. It's really pretty. Celeste gets up and there is an outline of Celeste's entire body in sunblock and sweat. They look at the wreckage. Uh boy. Don't worry. I know people who can get that out. Easily. Okay. I guess I'm getting it. The Riley account is a handful. I've been sooooo swamped. It's great you're staying busy... (about the couch) If it doesn't come out, I can have it reupholstered. Thanks. How's dating? Sorry, can I get your card? Here you go. Great. Dating's really great. Have you talked to Jesse? No, but I actually ran into him last night. I think he's getting a little fat. I think he's been looking pretty fit lately. (to the saleswoman) Can I get a rush delivery on that? So you've seen Jesse? ...Yeah, I have. Huh. Have you hung out with... Veronica? Yeah. Yes. I have. So, my first available delivery is Monday afternoon. Does that work for you? Yeah, that's fine. If you can you just call my cell... She's dumb, right? Huh? Oh no, not dumb. Simple. Simple means dumb. No, actually, simple in a really elegant way. Elegant?? Okay, so you're all set then. Elegant?? Thanks a lot. (to Celeste) I am, I just didn't realize that Monica was "elegant." Veronica. And you know what? You would probably really like her. Not one. Please let me drive you home. I'm afraid you'll drown. Sure. I have a date tonight so I should probably shower before then. Beth looks at a sopping Celeste. Yes. Shower. Who's the date? Rupert Bates. Rupert Bates? The Gap model?? Oh my god, he's so hot but he's like 15. 22. Skillz set me up. He's about to be a huge star. He's filming "20,000 B.C.?" It's the prequel to Fuck, I LOVED that movie. I loved that movie too! It really spoke to me. That was so...good. Lucky lady. So how do you know Skillz? (sotto) Ew. Celeste cringes. What a dork. Rupert slides next to Celeste and is all of a sudden right in her face. He touches her hair. He kisses her, deeply. He pulls away and takes her in. Oh...hi. Oh god. (whispers) Oh no, no, no I gotta go. Here. Do you want an Adderall? Hi Riley, I'm Celeste, I'm a partner at Pop Form. Too much sugar? Coffee? Alcohol? Um...it's actually regimen? Regime is a system of government. It's a "skin regimen." Charming. Right. Yes. Sorry. So we are going for an industrial feel with the artwork... Uh, you got my IM. Where are the guys who don't wear makeup for a living? And maybe a little intellect? A little intellect wouldn't hurt anybody. Scott has an idea. The photographer? You know him? (she sings, like she's in a musical) I'm uncomfortable with daaaaaating. I don't like any of iiiiiit. You really got to try a little harder to integrate the gayness, Scott. So you pissed in your pants? Wow. That is incredible. I think he's smiling, maybe. Well, the world will think you're brilliant. No one will ever know but me. Well, the guy who won shit his pants, so... They laugh. They are connecting. How about room service? That was really, really nice. Making out with you. They start to kiss again. (whisper) Why are you doing that? Don't do that..It was going so well. Almost where?? No! Celeste quickly grabs her stuff and gets the hell out of dodge. Vegan Vittles. No, I don't want to do a video chat. Yeah. Just tell her she needs to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she hangs up, now on the Blackberry) Sorry, one second, I just have to send this e-mail. Jesse sits there and wait for several seconds for her to finish her e-mail. A lot. (to waitress) Can I get some coffee? Um, green tea? Water's fine. Wow. Thanks. You look good too. Huh, I didn't know you did pilates. Um...work is great. My book is getting great reviews. Riley Banks is a new client which is huge. Things are going really well. It's only weird if you think it's weird. Thank you. You didn't. Glad we cleared that up. What? Where's she from? (sotto) Huh. Belgium. Elegant. Nothing. Well, Jesse, I've been busy with work. Because some people work for a living. So I haven't really been focused on what I can do to help you get on with your new life. What makes you think you are even suitable to be a dad?? You don't even know how to read the electric bill. How are you going to support yourself? Have you even thought this through? Really? Really Jesse? I paid the rent for ten years. If that's not supportive, I don't know what is. We never even talked about kids. I had reservations about having kids with YOU. Low blow. Exactly. Get a real job. Celeste exits. Jesse's a fucking vegan?? A vegan who's soon to have his work shown. At the Gagosian. The Gagosian?? You're kidding. What, the fucking clothespin thing? When?? Don't tell me actually...how did anybody even know about his art, he doesn't...I don't actually want to know...god, he's on fire right now. Breaking up with me was the best thing that ever happened to Jesse. I should break up with me. Now, now. Someone else's success is not your demise, C. Shut up. Unless it's Jesse's. Who are dressed as again? Beiber. Ooh, he just got a buzzcut. Really? Fuck. When?? A couple hours ago. It was on Perez. That's so sad. His hair was everything. I need to fucking drink. Noooo. YES. What? Oh, White trash. Snow White is silent. Celeste points to her trash bag. Yoga? I've been running a lot. Keeps you in better shape. How's your practice? (waving her finger in his face, laughing) Uh huh. What are you? You're "punny." About what? Barely an Ivy. Do you smoke? Me too. Let's go. Shhhh. Don't say open. Your costume's great. Don't ruin it. My husband of six years wants a divorce so he can marry the woman who's carrying his child. That's the deal with you and me. He's having a baby with a girl he barely knows. He's so lost. He's just going about it all...wrong. What do you mean? Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be right, I AM right. People will let you down. I've accepted that fact, but unfortunately, most of the time, knowing that does keep you from being happy. But at least it's real. Time to go, drunky. Hey, it's Celeste. You know, I still have a bunch of your stuff in the office. You should probably grab it at some point. Okay. She hangs up. She makes a decision. She grabs a box and starts throwing everything and anything in it that belongs to Jesse. You're going to be a really good dad. I don't know, I just know it. At least they recycle. It's um...Godelieve. No, Goldelieve. It means loved by the Gods. It's Dutch. What does it mean? Guitar Hero?? That's quite an extravagant purchase for a freelance writer and his "elegant" Belgian bride. Hey! I just... I lost something. My bracelet. It was a whole thing. It's over now. Yes! Hi! Wow, you're so pregnant, right! I love your sweater. Oh. Thanks! (beat) Are you bleeding? What? Oh (she touches her cheek), yeah, I guess I am. Let me get you something for that. NO. No, don't. It's fine, just a little cut. Are you sure? I'm so sorry about this. No, I'm sorry. So sorry. Well, I'm late for things. Have a good afternight. You sure you don't want to come in for a drink? Nooooo, no. That's very nice but no. Great to see you guys! Okay. Waht? Oh, yeah, that's weird. I don't know how...here you go. She laughs nervously and hands him his journal. Celeste walks to her car. You told her you liked her sweater? What are you, twelve? It was a disaster. But you should have seen the sweater. So great. Beth, am I losing my mind? Maybe. No. Please no more trash- diving. Let's focus on you now. This guys Paul keeps calling me but I don't know... C, you never know. Just go out with him. It doesn't have to be perfect... I met him at the gym. I'm not meeting my husband at the gym. Just go. Nothing to lose. So where do you live? We reveal that she is lying next to Paul, they are both about to get thai massages. Cool. Ahhhhh.(responding to the stretch) Wow, this is a unique place to take a date. I feel special. Not...that well. I've been on a real winning streak, so I thought I'd call you. AHHHH! I don't know what your definition of relaxing is but... Why would you take me to a place where Asian people beat you up? That was absolute torture. I feel great, actually. Where are we going now? Oh my god, don't, with the yoga. This place is...really cool. I am, Westwood condo. Ohh!! Celeste is into it now. She dances around him, other people watch them. Paul pulls Celeste in close. Celeste kisses Paul quickly, to his surprise. Vairyaga, bro, let go. Not everything has to have a reason. I don't know what I'm doing. Dating is stupid and all of a sudden, my ex-husband bakes cakes? It's probably fucking gluten-free. Nothing. Can you just roll a joint please? Skillz rolls a tight joint. What are they like together? Yeah. So he's not happy. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think it's perfect. Wow, yeah, there is a little of that happening. I.M. Pei. Huh. No, I'm just impressed that you know anything about architecture. I'm sorry? Are you...?? How dare you... Riley smiles at Celeste, turns and leaves. Dark little prison?? Bitch, what does she know. You know what's a dark little prison?? Having to wear midriffs for a living. What does she... Celeste is pulling into her driveway and notices...Jesse, sitting on her porch, smoking a cigarette. I can see that. That must go well with your pilates. Jesse looks sad and confused. You want to come in? Jesse, that's great. I'm so happy for you. Yeah. It's really nice to see you. He hugs her. Tight. They breathe together. They hug tighter. He pulls away, looks at her and kisses her for one second, very tenderly. She pulls away. Yeah. I don't see anything. What? Really? I don't see it. I think it's a stretch. Oh. Oh my God. Oh wow, I totally see it now. WOW. Ha. Haha. Hahahahaaha. Celeste starts laughing uncontrollably. It's the funniest thing she's ever seen. Scott, come on... You're being dramatic. No...okay. Hey. I know. That's why I called. Wait, let me say something. I don't know what happened last night. I don't know what's happening with your other situation. But I need to say this. For the record, I fucked up. I was cavalier about you. I took us for granted. And I know this may sound crazy but I'd be remiss if I didn't...if you were open to it...I think that I could do better. With you. With us. If there's a chance still...I'd like to know. Jesse can't even look at her. Hey! Jesse pauses for a moment. He turns. Oh no, I think you do. And? You're a fucking coward. Well, you never changed for me. Jesse pauses. Wow. All I did was wait for you to grow up! I rooted for you, I fucking paid for everything, I did everything for you! Right. Well, I know my success was never easy for you. And you are? Pretending to be a father? Pretending to be an adult? I just want you to admit that you're wrong! You know what, Jesse? You definitely will blow it. Don't ever call me. She's so sad. No, she's sad. I can tell. I went to dance camp. We see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke. Will it? You don't know that. Celeste grabs a handful of Cheetos from an economy-sized bag. But I didn't want it like this. Huh? Huh. You have a pet? Can I come? Will you bring me some Panda Express? Do you think the Obamas are really in love? Noon? Right, right. Hi honey, you remember Eileen from... Do you have any more of that ranch dressing? It's the fucking booooooomb. Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beth's mom, CAROL, 60, very large, a big sloppy hug. Let's get you a soda. They get to the bar. Do you guys have any tequila? I'll have both please. Beth pulls Celeste away from the bar and brings her into the house and plops her down on the couch. I'm going to recommend some quiet time for you right now. Can I smoke? No. Celeste starts weeping. I don't want to be alone forever. Not forever, honey. Just until you sober up. You'll be fine. Okay then, I'll just go to the other side of the pool. I promise I won't make you look bad. At least she's quiet now. (on the phone) Hey Riley, it's Celeste. I just want to talk to you about this "error" in your logo. I'm so, so sorry, I will fix this...call me. I just think it's corny to wear white two nights in a row. I want to rock a pattern, or maybe something in pastel... What the fuck does Riley Banks know. Um...nothing. She's a tart. Yeah dude! She's fucking moderately talented, blessed with a good face and has maybe 5 more years left of stardom. Who is she to tell ME what... Oh boy. The thing is, I have been having a really hard time in my life, everything is sort of falling apart and when you said that thing about contempt and investigation, it just sort of hit a nerve and... Oh. God, I'm sorry. I didn't even know you had a boyfriend. So you called the smartest person you know. Riley smiles through her tears. Oh, yeah, this just reminds me of someone. Yeah. A guy. Yeah, I do. Kind of. No, it doesn't. But you do. You're gonna be fine. Hi...I know I won't...no I'm on the road already! Near...Bakersfield? Of course I'll be there...love you too. She hangs up and was clearly lying. She must do something. Something she does not want to do. She looks at the stoic woman in front of her. She pursued her love of Spanish men, but missed her Tucker, more than just as a friend. And our princess returned home to her loving prince, and they've been together ever since. And now we're gonna hear from Celeste, Beth's best friend in the world. Thank you. Thanks a lot, girls, that was so...wow. There are no words. Well, this is gonna sound bad but I actually forgot that I was speaking tonight. He is so special. Not as special as that poem. That those girls did? I meant it. You know what else is beautiful? Jesse? What are you doing? Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where we find the littlest thing that resembles a penis and we just, you know... I don't get it. Celeste and Jesse stop. It's stupid. Veronica is looking at Celete's food. Oh, the foods out. (to Celeste) See you on the dance floor? Watch out for Tucker though. They leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling. She bites into the carrot. Wait, wait, wait. I think I may have to challenge. Zooecia?? That's not a word, that's my hoochie cousin's name! Yes, I definitely am. I've never lost a game of Scrabble in my life. No you're not. Will you get a condom? No, you're using a condom. What? Are you not into it? Then, what's the deal? Right, I'm confused...why not sleep with me then? Oh. (further realizing) Oh. Okay. Well, I like you too. Celeste looks distant. ACTUALLY, WEIRDLY, I'M KINDA HAPPY THE GAYS REALLY KNOW HOW TO PARTY, THIS IS A GAY CLUB. RILEY, THE CLUB IS CALLED SWALLOW. Sure... Wow, so, what, you just buy the biggest size they make? Tweens don't want her anymore. But the gays do! Ten percent of Americans are gay, Scott. You're gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod. She could be Lady Gaga by the end of the year. Huge market. We WILL make the cock in the butt work for us. The cock in the butt will be huge! Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self- consciously. Look, you do not know me. I do not want to assemble. Trust me, you do not want me to assemble. Bad things happen. Could I just take the floor model? I'll hook you up. Thanks, dude. Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart filled with baby stuff. She approaches her. Of course, yeah, hi! What are you doing? Oh, I'm getting a dresser. You? Oh, you know getting... She is? Very. And so helpful right now. Of course. (laughs nervously) Well, looks like you're really organized. Organized, terrified. You'll do great. Thanks. I hope so. No, don't. Really. There's nothing to apologize for. I'm the one who's sorry. I mean, I dug through your trash. Look, I don't blame you. For anything. This has all been so weird. Everything happened really fast. Yeah, it did. But everything will work out. I know it. Jesse's book is coming out... He's so talented. Yeah, he is. An awkward silence. You too. They both steer their carts towards each other in opposite directions but bump right into each other. Oh sorry! Oh, it's okay! Bye again. Ooohh ohhh. Til you come back to me.. No, we ARE really good. Get ready. You're first. Shhh come on. Focus. (quietly) I can't. No. I can't. No. This. Us. I'm sorry. I just...can't. I think I need to be alone? I'm not ready. I'm having fun and I feel like I'm beginning to like you and I just don't think I'm ready for that. I'm so sorry. You are so...great. But I'm getting divorced. I think I need to go through this alone. What? Thanks. I like that tie. Is it made out of organic mung beans? Jesse nods and chuckles. Ohhh, I see. All right. They've broken the tension. But it's still silent. Then Jesse chortles. It sounds like a baby pig. It makes Celeste laugh. We did it. Sure. These are beautiful. Yeah, well, I've never seen them at night. Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in. He looks pretty sad. What? Veronica? Left where? Hey...don't do that. You are not a loser. You never were. You took a chance. I admire that and I believe in you. I do. And I want to thank you. For never being the person I wanted you to be. Go get her. Well, who does? Do you love her? Then it's worth fighting for. God, I finally understand why you fucking cry all the time. Shit is emotional. So...I guess we were right. I love you too. Hey. So, you're probably giving your card to some girl in yoga right now. But if that doesn't work out for you...I think I may be ready. To beat you in Scrabble. Excuse me, sir? The young man turns around. Celeste realizes she's no longer this person. She restrains herself. No problem. She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.
