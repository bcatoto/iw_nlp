I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better. I thought General Soholob was in charge of the export business. You really think I'm pretty? Are you kidding? I'm working! I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything. Look, you can't pull me out of this right now. Let me put you on hold. Where's Barton now? But he's alive. Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me. Bozhe moi. What are doing here?! Get out! You shouldn't be here! I have to see the doctor! It's my father! My father... Please. You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. Then, what is it? Yoga? Just you and me. I did. Natasha Romanoff. No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD. We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent. Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in. I'll persuade you. You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak. Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe. This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet. Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be. Not that he's told me. Talk to Fury, he needs you on this. No one's gonna put you in a... Stand down. We're good here. Hi. They need you on the bridge. Face time. There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? They're vintage, he's very proud. Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath. That's still not gonna find them in time. You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. Loki, drop the weapon and stand down. The guy's all over the place. Not a word. Where's this coming from? Another Asgardian? I'd sit this one out, Cap. These guys come from legends, they're basically gods. But you figured I'd come. It's really not that complicated. I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out. You're a monster. (turns back around; poised) So, Banner... that's your play. Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send Thor as well. Thank you for your cooperation. You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor? Loki's manipulating you. You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you. (quietly, to herself) I'm okay. We're okay, right? Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We're gonna be okay. Listen to me. We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on my life I will get you out of this, you will walk away, and never... Bruce. This is Agent Romanoff. I copy. Clint, you're gonna be alright. We don't have that long, it's gonna take time. He didn't, I just...CLINT BARTON Natasha. I've been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I'd like to wipe it out. Go where?
