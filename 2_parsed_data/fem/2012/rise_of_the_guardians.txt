I wonder who it's gonna be? Maybe the Leprechaun? (caught admiring Jack) Well, ah, as long he helps to ah...to protect the children, right? EASTER BUNNY! HOP-HOP-HOP! Ow! You okay, Soph? Jamie, hat? We don't want Jack Frost nipping at your nose. No one, honey. It's just an expression. Jamie Bennett! No fair! Grrrrrrrrrrrr... Crud, I hit Cupcake. Wasn't me. (walla; mocking her Alright you, tooth under your pillow? Now don't stay up trying to see her, Jamie, or she won't come. Hide, hide, hide, hide! Uh uh, straight to bed now, mister. (to another fairy) Walla Walla, Washington. We've got a trampoline mishap at 1340 Ginger Lane. Hello, Jack. I've heard a lot about you. And your teeth. (moves in way too close) Open up! Are they really as white as they say? Yes! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 32. Oh, they really do sparkle like freshly fallen snow. Girls, pull yourselves together... Let's not disgrace the uniform. Jack...I don't think you understand what it is we do. Each of those lights is a child. Oh, sorry. They're beautiful. Last night, Jack. He chose you. Bunny! Enough! They, they took my fairies! And the teeth! All of them! Everything is gone! Everything. Oh thank goodness! One of you is alright! Pitch, you have got thirty seconds to return my fairies! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! They, they don't believe in me anymore. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 51. (not her bubbly self) You should've seen them. They put up such a fight. It's not the teeth he wanted. It's the memories inside them. That's why we collect the teeth, Jack. They hold the most important memories of childhood. My fairies and I watch over them and when someone needs to remember what's important, we help them. We had everyone's here. Yours too. From when you were young. Before you became Jack Frost. Of course you were. We were all someone before we were chosen. You really don't remember? I...I can't, Jack. Pitch has them. Oh no! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 54. The children. We're too late. What? We're talking seven continents! Millions of kids! Four bicuspids over there! An incisor two blocks east! Is that a molar? They're EVERYWHERE! Ow! Fine...sorry, it's been a really long time since I've been out in the field. Ah, four hundred forty years...give or take. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there, champ! He's one of us! Part of the European division. (to the mouse) Ca va? Wow! You guys collect teeth and leave gifts as fast as my fairies. You guys have been leaving gifts, right? This was always the part I liked most - seeing the kids. Why did I ever stop doing this? Thanks for being here, Jack. I wish I had known about your memory, I could've helped you. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 63. SSHHHHHHHH!! Believed in. Surprise! We came! Shhh! You guys, he's still awake. Hey, this is not proper Tooth Fairy behavior! Pretty! Bunny! Hop! Hop! Hop! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 68. Ow! Jack, how did you do that? Look how fast they're going out. Ohh no, mate. My warren my rules. Buckle up. Elf, elf, elf! Don't worry, Bunny. I bet she's a fairy fan. (flies up to Sophie) It's okay little one. Pretty! Awww! You know what, I got something for you. Here it is. (she pulls something out) Look at all the pretty teeth with little blood and gum on them. Peek-a-boo. Weeee! Weee, weee, weee! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 81. Okay! Weeeeee! I love her! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 85. I think it's time to get her home. Jack, no! Pitch is-- Maybe he just hid them really well this year. I can't believe it. There's no such thing as the Easter Bunny. Where did you get that? Where's Baby Tooth? Oh Jack, what have you done? Nightmares. Forget it, Jamie. There's just no Easter this year. (twitters - Don't give it to him!) Come on Jack, you can't have fun all the time. Jack, get down from there! Be careful. Jack, I'm scared. No we're not! (fighting back tears) Yes! You always play tricks! Jack! North! Are you okay? Look! Jack! (flies to him) Jack--! Jamie, how are you doing that?! Hey is, is that? Don't forget to floss! I will. And me. Yeah, Tooth Fairy!
