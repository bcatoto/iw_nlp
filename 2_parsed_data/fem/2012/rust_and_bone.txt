(with a hint of Southern accent) Is this all you have for him? Anna Van Versh, Ali's sister, is in her thirties. She is a huge woman, very tall with a pretty face. She wears leggings that make her ass look like a workhorse's and a pair of flip flops. At the bottom of the bag, Anna finds a passport and opens it. It is Sam's. She remembered his passport! You got to be kidding! How will you tend to the kid? I won't be able to all the time. I work, and so does Richard... Was he in school there? You don't know if your kid's in school? Back at your mom's place, did you go to school? I can try to enroll him at the school. I'll see... We also need to get him some clothes. He can't go like that... I'll ask the neighbors. (gives the child her hand) Come with me to You want to pet them? She lifts Sam up over the wire mesh. Careful. Don't step on their tiny paws. They're just babies. Anna shows him how to feed puppies, then stands back up. (to Ali) The breeder's picking them up next month. Brings in some money. Otherwise, Richard and I were thinking 300 a month for you and the kid... That okay? "Yeah" what? Is that too much? So what are you going to do? Yeah, whatever... You think there's any work around here? You think there's any more here than there? Where has that ever been the case? When you told me you were coming down, I have no idea, but if you stay here you have to pay your share, or else go somewhere else. As far as we're concerned, it's easy: we can't! How long were you thinking of staying? I have to go home... No, I came alone. I have my car in the lot. I'll be fine. I'm fine. I'm fine, I said. Thanks. How do I get my car afterwards? Seriously, I'll be fine. Trust me! We hear a voice from the parking lot. Shit. Did you hurt yourself? He shows her his right wrist. It's swelling up. He rests his hand on the wheel. After a beat: No. Yes. Oh yeah? How am I dressed? Yeah, so what? Excuse me? I don't believe this. Pull over here! Stop this car on the double! It's MY car! If I tell you to stop, you stop! Still no reaction, as if she hadn't said a thing. She is about to scream again, but remains silent, although open- mouthed. She finally settles back down on the back of her seat and looks elsewhere. A beat. That's enough now! They ride in silence. How will you get back? For a taxi. Wait, I'll go check. No! Even she is surprised by the brusqueness of her response. (embarrassed) Someone's up there. Wait here. I'll be right back. She takes a few steps, fumbling for her keys. She hesitates, then looks back. Okay, come on up. Nothing. A fight... Yeah, I'm fine. The bouncer from the Fever. He drove me home. He hurt his hand... Simon pulls Stephanie into the bedroom. Ice cubes in a Plexiglas salad bowl. Ali's hand in the bowl. He looks around. There are photos on the wall: Stephanie surfing on the back of a killer whale, Stephanie posing with a group of young people in diving suits in front of the Marineland logo, Stephanie rising out of the water on Niska's rostrum, etc. From the nearby bedroom, he hears snatches of Simon's Philippe and Christine. We decided to go out for a drink after. Feeling better? Not orcas. Just one orca. Her name is Niska. Yep... Ali nods vaguely admiringly. That what? A whore could train whales? Well, you see... Simon is at the door. He is wearing a jean. No, I'm not upset. She drinks the aspirin. I saw your face before... With that guy who dropped me off. I saw your face. I saw how you piped down. Yes, you piped down... (pause) Don't tell me what I should do, how I should live my life. Don't give me any more orders, Simon. Don't give me any more orders, that's all. She turns on the faucet and runs her lips under the water. Really... this isn't fair. No, Louise, there are lots of things you can say but not that. The pools are my responsibility and all I care about are the animals. I have to see to their environment and that starts with their trainers. Do you understand? What are you trying to make me believe, that I wasn't up to par? No, listen. Lacking in maturity? Skills? You're not consistent. We've already discussed that. The foundation of the relationship with the orcas is stability. During your internship you've had your ups and downs. It's not your competence that... You know this has nothing to do with my internship. You couldn't care less if I was competent or not! It has to do with that I fucked Michael. Just say so. Oh, please... And in fact what really bothers you is not that we fucked, but that he told me about you. How you think you're so... How you've become such a bitch. That's why you're firing me. That's what you should write in your report. Okay, are you done? We can stop here. No need to spoil the rest of your internship. Louise stands up. What... What happened? Tom and Niska... They got in each other's way. Then Louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving suit. She tries to find a pressure point. Stephanie sees Louise's face wet with tears: Stop it, calm down. I'm fine! Her hand searches for something at thigh level, without finding it. She faints. I was next doing the laundry. I'll put him in the shower. There was an accident at Marineland. Ali answers without taking his eyes off the screen. Help! Help! Please! On the linoleum, two stumps stick out of Stephanie's nightshirt: two thick bandages surround her thighs that look like two wrapped hams. My legs! What did you do with my legs? Two nurses arrive. Stephanie is back in bed, the IVs in her arms. Louise rocks her gently. Stephanie's eyes struggle against sleep. She wants to scream again, but doesn't have the strength. She I stopped by your place. I saw the cleaning woman. She didn't want me to pay her. She was... in shock. She's scared to come here. She sends her regards. She closes her eyes. Black. She opens them. - A blonde, pretty woman in her fifties is sitting behind Stephanie, her face is close to hers. It is her mother. She speaks with a slight accent. I spoke to your brothers. They wanted to talk to you but I didn't think it was the right time. We'll all come with Hugo during the next school break... I was afraid I might lose you. I don't know what I'd have (in German) Hugo wanted to say goodbye to you. We're leaving tomorrow but we'll pray for you, honey. Her eyes remain open. Black. Really? Mourning who? Mourning my legs? Yeah, it's really symbolic... No, it's the grass. I'll stop... She laughs so hard she cries. It's Stephanie. Remember me? We met at the Fever. Ali is taken by surprise. You know what happened to me? (sniggering) How do you think I am? A beat. Ali is at a loss to answer. How are you? Still a bouncer? You want to get together? I'm... crazy busy too. Every day and every night. I don't know how to manage... A beat. Now. Come now. Come in. She is waiting in her wheelchair, holding the remote control. She activates it and the door closes behind Ali. Her hair is mid-length, her face has thickened and there are bags under her eyes. She is wearing a baggy Nike T- shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom whose legs hang limp. Have you been waiting long? Was that you who rang before? She looks exhausted but feverish. Come in. Sit down. He sits down on a small couch. Want something to drink? A coffee? I only have instant. I don't know... Three or four months. Help me what? Walk? Yeah there are people. They come and go. Hold on. She manages to navigate from the living room into her bedroom. He stays in the living room. He hears a kettle whistle in the kitchen. He goes into the kitchen and pours water into the glass/mug. He finds her hunched over in her I'm fine. He opens the window. Does it stink here? It's me. He opens the curtains and looks outside. It is getting hot out. The automatic sprinklers have gone on. Yes. No. Leave me alone. I don't know. You're the one who wanted to go out... I don't care. He tries to push the wheelchair, but she stops him: Stop it. I want to puke. He notices that his moped is attached in the middle of a sprinkler area. He goes to free it and gets splashed... Heavy chain, padlock... he comes back with soiled hands. When he comes back, she's gone. He sees the wheelchair moving toward the seafront avenue. He goes to join her. Go ahead. Huh? Do you realize what you're saying? Forget it. He wavers a moment, then finally crosses the seafront avenue. Actually I think I will go in. He looks at her. She covers herself with a towel and wiggles out of her pants, revealing what remains of her legs. Her stumps are white, with terrible scars at their extremities. You have to carry me. Help me... Yes. He lifts her up and carries her to the water. He takes her far enough in until she begins to float. Don't let me go! Not right away... Do it gently. She feels unsure of herself. He lets go of her gradually. She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and grace. She stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread water. He joins her. She grabs onto him. I can't stop. If I do, I sink. Wait... She gesticulates... This is bothering me! She takes off her T-shirt and hands it to him. Her breasts press against Ali's chest. Okay, you can let go. She lets herself go and crawls like a pro. He stays put, holding her t-shirt. Twenty-five meters later, her head emerges. He hears a burst of laughter. Half asleep in a deck chair, he looks up from time to time to see how she's doing. She calls out to him. She is sitting in the water. She motions for him to come and get her. He helps her out and takes her into his arms. She hangs on to him, still out of breath. Fuck that's good! The beach is crowded now. Ali carries her back to the deck chairs. Some bathers watch them go by, others look away. They are stretched out in their chairs. She has wrapped her lower body in a beach towel. They sunbathe. Thanks. Thanks. Steph! Made up and well-groomed, she looks older than she actually is. Stephanie answers from the bathroom. I'm in here! Louise puts the mail on the living room table and enters the bedroom. Stephanie wheels herself out of the bathroom, her hair wet and her body wrapped in a towel. Shit, you're not ready! The appointment is in a half hour! It's fine! What do you mean? You're a freaking pain! I have to get back to work. Come on, let me help you. She grabs the arms of the wheelchair and pushes Stephanie toward the closet. Let go of me! Stop, I can manage alone. Oh yeah? Okay, so manage then! She lets go of the wheelchair and leaves the bedroom. (annoyed) I can do the seat belt! In front of the open trunk, Louise struggles to fold the wheelchair. Can't you call them to tell them we're going to be late? Don't you have something simpler, classier? I don't know... like a wooden leg with a piece of rubber at the end? Or just a plank. A plank with wheels and straps. And irons to move forward with. (furious) Can you cut it out? What? If I want... I've had enough of your schtick, you hear me? Come on... Shut up! Stephanie shuts up. Vitias still looks patient as Job. Go if you want… I'll take a taxi. I told them I was with you. And that works? If you tell them you're with me, do they let you do what you want? Well... Cool. If ever you want a day off, just tell me. I'll write you a note. Louise looks at her. She's not going to let her get on her nerves. There is a knock at the door. A nurse enters. She checks the resin bands, looks at her watch. 10 more minutes, just to make sure. Then Doctor Vitias will come for you. She smiles and closes the door. The two young women are again left alone. Stephanie stretches out her hand. Louise takes it. And they remain like that. Keep Sam with you for 5 minutes! She hurries to find some papers in the drawer of a commode. Ali hasn't budged. Oh! Hear me? I don't want your son in the garden. What the hell? I asked you to watch him for 5 minutes! (to Sam) He's taking them to the country. They'll be so happy there. What are you doing? Are you his father or not? Don't talk to me like that! Ali rips the child from his sister's grip. Sam struggles. Don't touch him! Don't touch him I said! You know what? You're... you're a bad person. Huddled against Anna's breasts, Sam opens his eyes. What kind of boxing? Thai? Do you use your feet? Is it the first time you're doing this? And you're not scared? How much do they pay you for this? You're doing that for 500 euros? You're going to get whacked on the face and risk your health for 500 euros? I'll give you the 500! Cancel it and I'll give it to you tomorrow. If it's not for money, why then? Why are you doing it? Yeah and look how I ended up. Your fight, if you do it... You think I can come along? Who are the other guys? You okay? What do I do? It's nothing, just a cut. (to Martial) Got anything to disinfect it with? (to Ali) Keep this on it. It's the only one I have. Ali looks up at her. Yes. Put this on it. It's the only one I have. Ali straightens up, covers himself with the towel and remains like that: invisible, out of breath, clearing his throat and spitting out the window... Stephanie observes the welts on his body. A big service station appears a bit farther down the road. Ali sits back up. No, not very. Alone in the back seat, Stephanie looks out at the service station. What do you want to know? If I knew him before the accident? Martial looks back. You find it weird that we're together? You wonder what he's doing with me? No. Martial finishes counting the bills. Why are you giving me that? Exactly. So why give it to me? He looks at her, suddenly surprised. You have a kid? You see what you're like with him? You're not around and when you are, you scream at him. Damn, you hit him! Why did you take him along if you act like that? You should have left him. What's that? Where did you get this? (pointing to his new clothes) Same place? A fight? What kind of fight? Is that the only job you could find? Is that why you have marks on your face? Nothing. He leaves her with the envelope and trots over to the rest of the group. They are packing away ice chests and folding things up. Sam and his little friends are playing in the sand with the John Deere tractor. Sam has a bandage on his forehead. Ali sits down in the sand next to him. Stop looking. No more wheelchairs! Two days. Why? Is it a problem? Well, not exactly. I need to get my balance but supposedly that doesn't take long. I don't know. I've never walked on stilts before. A little, but it feels good too. The beach... pff, I don't know... It's different today... I don't think I want to get undressed. Look in the fridge. There must be some cheese left. No, I don't have any pate. He gets up and opens the fridge. He takes the cheese, sniffs it, then takes some yoghurt too. He notices a box of cereal on a shelf and takes it. He returns to the fridge for some milk. She watches, her mouth open in suspense. You're a good eater, aren't you? There are crackers up there. Do you have a girlfriend? He shakes his head. You don't have anyone? What are they? Quick fucks? A lot? He looks at her. You mind talking about this? When, before? I was with Simon... No, there were others. But not a lot either. I... I wasn't very... In fact, I liked it when guys looked at me... I liked to feel that I turned them on... Afterwards, I don't know... they bored me. Ali looks at her, strangely attentive, as if he didn't understand, or didn't believe her. Um, nothing. I don't even know what it looks like anymore... I don't even know if it still works... Did I say I didn't want to anymore? Of course I still want to... How do you think I go about it? If I were a guy I'd say I jerk off to a porn video... I'm a girl. Ali is dumbstruck. Okay, let's change the subject... She begins piling up plates and silverware. Huh? Just like that? I... I don't know if I can like that... Wait. She wheels herself away from the table and into the bedroom. He remains alone, quickly cleaning the table. Wait! He waits. Then: Come here. Let's try. He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away gently. (a little nervous) Do you mind if we don't kiss? Yes. He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering her. She tries to wriggle herself free. You're crushing me! Okay, I'll stop. His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her thighs. He enters her. She is about to scream, but lets herself go. She grabs hold of him. Gently! Um, yes... no... I don't really know. It's different... It's hard to tell after just one try... (blushing) No, no! That's not what I meant... I just meant that it's too soon to tell... like too many things are happening at once... Ali doesn't understand. I did. A beat. What's "oper"? If you're "oper" we... Nothing. Great. Louise? Louise, are you here? Is anyone here? No answer. She looks over the office she once knew so well and that hasn't seen again since her accident: the photos on the wall, the diagrams, the case histories, the animals' names, etc... (gently) Stephanie? Stephanie looks back to discover Louise and three other ex- colleagues. They have been there a moment, surprised, unsettled and ill at ease. I stopped by the office but there wasn't anyone. Stephanie stands up with the help of her canes. The guys rush over to help her. They hug and kiss. All four remain like that for a moment. (softly) See? It wasn't hard! They smile at each other and return to the conversation in progress. Stephanie's cell phone vibrates on the table. She discreetly checks the answer, and when she looks up, exchanges a glance with Louise. From that glance, we cut to: When I feel like it, I send him a text message and ask if he's oper. If he is, we hook up. Louise reacts. What's oper? If he's up for it. If he's free. If he is, we fuck. Is that all? Yes, that's all. What else do you want? I don't know. Is that enough? For me it is. What does he do? Stephanie hesitates a moment, as if worried about how Louise will react. He fights. What kind? MMA? No. Illicit fights in the projects. Louise reacts. Whatever I say, you make a face. Just give me a second to react... Are you in love? She hesitates. He does me good. Who is it? He looks for his clothes... I didn't know you were here. You scared me. What were you up to? You're not alone? You bring girls back to my place now? Oh, my God. Poor thing! So that's him? They are sitting around the garden table. Anna comes carrying a tray. They were out of grapefruit. I took tropical fruit. She puts some glasses and two tetra packs of fruit juice on the table. Through a hole in the oilcloth, Stephanie can watch Sam playing under the table. I'll make tea. I have some cookies. You drink tea, don't you? Don't bother. This is perfect, I swear. Thanks. Before Stephanie can even finish, Anna is already on the way back to the kitchen. So this is where you sleep? It's a nice room. Sam nods in agreement. He gives her a strange look. Why are you looking at me like that? Does it scare you? You want to see them, is that it? He nods. She lifts one of her pant legs to show the prosthesis underneath. Sam looks attentively, stretches out his hand, touches it carefully. No... Want to touch it? Sam reaches out his hand. Here. He applies it to his eyebrow. She displaces a bloody strand of hair and replaces it with another. We see Martial return to the car and open the front door. Because you think bone has a taste? What are you doing there? She's a young employee in the store uniform. Is it your stuff? You work for them? She continues to manipulate her phone. Why shouldn't I? You film us! He straightens up menacingly. Is he okay with that? Why me? (laughs, thrown for a loop) Yes, sure but.... I don't know anything about that scene... I don't know those guys! He hands her an old spiral notebook. How do I do the bets? Honestly, can you see me dealing with those beasts? No. A shadow crosses Stephanie's mind. She looks at the open bags and suitcases, without really seeing them. The place looks like it's expecting a police raid. Where are you going? Austria? Was the insurance money your idea? No, no! Yes? Yeah... where else would it be? Why would they do that? No. And I don't want anything to happen to it. Now more than ever! He looks at her, incredulous, but with admiration. Do I sound like that? (loud) Huh? I can't hear you... (loud) Champagne? The guy orders. He is blond, lean and athletic-looking. He might be thought to resemble Simon. Hey there. I'm Marie. No... No, please. I don't feel like it. Not tonight. I can't... The guy looks disappointed, then manages a ‘good loser's' smile. It's best I go. Good night and thanks. You couldn't know what? You couldn't know what, asshole? Foued runs to warn Martial, Khadi and Cousin that something is wrong. When Martial arrives, he sees Stephanie collared by a bouncer three times her size. She lashes out with one of her canes, while under the bar, another bouncer tries to help the blond guy back to his feet. There's a deep gash on his skull. Cousin comes to give the bouncer a hand. Fine. I can't remember. Afterwards the cousin took us to a club at la Colle sur Loup... It sucked and it was 5 a.m. And you? You think it's good that we're having this conversation? That I ask how it was with the girl last night and you answer normal. Nothing. He grimaces at her mood. "Oh la" what? You think it's normal leaving with that bimbo in front of me? What would you say if I did the same thing? Oh yeah? You wouldn't care? Wait, let me put it differently. What I am for you? A friend? A pal? Sort of a buddy, like Foued and the others? Tell me something: do you and your buddies fuck every now and then? He snickers. No? Really? Never? That's the difference. Her looks at her. Dammit, stop looking at me that way! You wanted us to continue... Isn't that what you told Martial? Well, we have to go about it well. We have to show each other manners, and consideration... Hey! Stop acting like an idiot. Do the words bother you? You know what I mean.... Tact... You've never stopped being tactful with me. A beat. He looks away. So... is that a plan? She waits for his mind to come back before continuing. We'll continue... but not like animals. He smirks, with a flick of the chin. Cat got your tongue? Ali stirs his cup without answering. He feels her eyes on him. He smiles. What? (softly) You are really a dog. He stands up. What are you doing? Why? You're bored? What I'm saying bores you? Are you acting like a jackass on purpose? I'm the one who's leaving. She gets up. Ali finishes his coffee. 3400. Are you ready? Walking with a slow, deliberate sway - aware of the effect she's having - she ceremonially opens the passenger door. The remarks cease. Here. He sits up. She is embarrassed. No, don't look! I'm going to pee. Five. I don't like it when you see me like this... I called the numbers they gave me at the gym. I spoke to an organizer, Günther Bower. She yawns. There's a gala in Turin next week. He told me that we'd have time to meet there. I'm going to go. Later, in his gym in Dortmund. He wants to organize a test match, to see what you're worth. To see if you've got the "Göttlicher Zorn""... Ali comes out of the shower. Turn on the water. Turn on the water when you pee. It's disgusting. He runs some water. How's your nose? It doesn't seem broken. (in German) Mr. Bower? (in German) I'm Stephanie Granget. Günther looks about fifty and has obviously spent many of those years in the ring. (in German) Can you get me a ticket for tonight? An accident. In another life. I was an animal trainer. I worked with orcas... The show took a turn for the worse. Why? Of course, Mr. Bower. (in German) What? That? So do I. He draws her inside. The door closes. I got fired. What are you doing? Close it! Don't eat here. Ali stares at her, stunned. Don't eat here. I was fired this morning. I'm unemployed. They had cameras in the storeroom... They filmed us when we took the expired food. They fired us. Ali's head spins. You had your sister fired. How does it feel? How much did you get for that? You get paid per person or a flat rate? Nothing to say? I take you in, I take care of your son and you have nothing to say? You couldn't know? You couldn't know what? That you were screwing us out of jobs? That you were hurting people? Ali tries to find something to say, but his sister's hand delivers a resounding slap. He takes it like a man. A moment passes. Ali is red from the slap, red with shame… until he suddenly straightens up and knocks over the table. Go to your room. Go upstairs immediately. In his message he said he was in Strasbourg. No news since. I don't know what he's doing Did you try the gym? Yeah. They don't know. If I had an address or a number, I'd give it to you... Even if I think it's dumb. Do you believe me? Yes. After what he did to me... Sam sees Stephanie join Anna near the door. She's about to leave. He abandoned his kid. He doesn't give a fuck about anything. All he ever cared about was himself. He's totally selfish. Sam watches the two women swallowed up by the light. You don't know him. Me? What did you expect with him? I don't know. Not this. Fade to black. Black. We'll take care of you. Come with me. He doesn't understand. Then he notices the blood prints his hands have left on the ICU window. He looks at his scarred fingers, his broken, bloodied hands. It's me. (pause) Do you mind? How is he? Is he injured? And how are you? Is it serious? I'm okay. You mean in general? In my life? I'm not asking for anything. I'll be going. I'll call you back to see how Sam's doing. Give him a kiss him from me... I won't hang up... I won't leave you. Black.
