Merry Christmas, John. Well, I think we had a wonderful Christmas this year. Really, sweetie? Well, that's exciting. Oh my god... My god, Steve... it's a miracle. A Christmas miracle. ...young boy's stuffed animal has magically come to life for as yet unknown reasons. Scientists are stumped as to how... (SPEAKS JAPANESE FOR A FEW MOMENTS) Thank you./Thanks so much. Hi you guys. Aw, thanks Alix, I worked out this morning. Oh wow, congratulations, John. Don't you think after four years, maybe she's probably hoping for something more than dinner? Well, if I were her, I'd be expecting a proposal. Hi guys. Ooh. I think you just got me stoned. Turkey burgers. No, just you homos. Wait, who's that? Is that good? Oh nice. Is she pretty? Good. Rex is fine. He only hit on me once today, so that's good. He's harmless, I can handle it. Jesus. Y'know, I think I might also have a Martina Navra-ti-brewski. Bullshit, what do you mean? I thought we were just doing funny names. Oh, look, they found those missing hikers. It says they got separated and one of them had his foot trapped under a rock for five days. You would? No, I think it's only cannibalism if you swallow. Really? That's not what I heard about you. I can see that. Y'know, speaking of classy, Ciao Bella's a really expensive restaurant. If you want, we can go somewhere else tomorrow night. I don't care, as long as we're together. (leaning in to kiss him) You're disgusting. Ooh. Oh, are the new wines in? I love you, too. (shaking her head) I don't understand it, 35 years old, and you're still scared of a little thunder. Wow...Baby, I'm not saying this to be nasty, but you look really tired. Oh, I'm okay... except I didn't have time for breakfast, the garage was full, I spilled coffee on my leg, and I have a boyfriend who can't sleep through a storm without his teddy bear. I don't understand why you keep putting up with him. Yeah, I mean, the guy's thirty-five years old and he's working for a rental car service. No, it's not that, I don't care about that. I'd love him even if he was a janitor. I mean, he's got a huge heart, we laugh together all the time, and it's just a bonus that he's like the hottest guy in Boston. Yeah but the hottest guy in Boston is like being the classiest Kardashian. I just wish he could get his life together, you know? Our life. And he can't, and I swear to god, it's all because of that bear. You should give him an ultimatum: it's you or the bear. I can't do that, he'd be devastated. And I mean... what if he chose Ted? Oh come on, you don't really think that. Not really, but what if? Well then... things happen for a reason. No they don't. That's just something girls say when something bad happens to them that they don't understand. Fuck off, Tracy. Actually Rex, I have a lot of work I need to get to-- Okay, fine. He's such an asshole. Out of control. Such a sleaze. You guys are so pathetic. You're shitting on Rex, and you both had sex with him. And so did you. Well, I didn't want one of you whores getting promoted before me. So... what do you need to talk to me about, Rex? You promised this was about work. I have a boyfriend, Rex. I think you know this. I'm very busy. Goodbye, Rex. That was perfect. Oh no, I'm fine, thanks. What are you, five years old? Ooh, Cristal. It doesn't seem like four years, does it? You had no business being out on that dance floor, but I'm glad you were. (a little stunned) Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. Well, yeah, I... I would hope it was an accident. Um, yes. My head hurts a lot. (beat, noticing him for the I'm Lori. Okay, here's a question that'll show how much you actually care about me. You remember we stayed and talked until the place closed, and then we went for late night eggs and waffles, and we stayed there til 5 a.m. watching a movie on the little TV in the diner. Name the movie. Gold star. I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt. Your dancing was bad. So do people with Parkinson's. Yeah, how do you remember it? Whatever you say, baby. No, we didn't. There was no such rule. Oh, John. Oh. Yeah. Great. Thanks. Well, um, here. This is for you. I remember you liked it when you saw Tom Brady wearing one in GQ. John, I don't need the Hope diamond, all I want is-- Look, I'm only saying this because I love you, but that's not realistic. You're never gonna have any kind of a career if you're always partying and wasting time with Ted. John, please get him to find his own place, so we can get on with our lives. Yeah. Fine. Let's talk about it ten years from now. Well, it's good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates, but John, you're not eight. You're thirty-five. And unless you're too blind to notice, he's not your only friend anymore. You have me. And I love you. Look, I've put the best physical years of my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now, but in a few years my body's gonna fall off a fucking cliff. Things'll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man. I need to feel secure in the fact that you won't leave me when that happens. And, my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place, so that's a lot less movin' around for you. Exactly, and you can do whatever you want with the other hand. We can achieve critical acclaim and become rich just by screwing each other. We can't put the real conversation off forever, John. That's my ringtone? What is it? It sounds negative. All right, well I'll see you upstairs. What the hell is all this?! This place is a wreck! Who are these girls? What is that?!!! There is... a shit in the corner! On the floor! There's a shit! There is a shit!! On my floor!! What the fuck!!!! What!!! The fuck!!! Oh, god!! It's so gross!! No! Oh my god! AAAA, I got some on my thumb! Shit! Hey there. Listen... I just wanna say thank you. What you did with Ted was a big step, and I know it wasn't easy, but I just want you to know that I love you for it. And, I think this a new beginning for our relationship. Y'know, I don't have to be at work for another twenty minutes... You know what my favorite thing about you is? After four years, you can still surprise me. To step up and change such a big part of your life just to make your girlfriend happier... I dunno, I bet you most guys couldn't do it. I'm sorry if I was pushy about it... (huh?) Inevitable. Well, that's... romantic? I think? That sounds like something Stephen Hawking would say to his girlfriend. Yeah, I do. And I feel exactly the same way about you. (smiling coyly, as she Yeah? That's the new bag girl. I don't know her name, but she seems cute. Hey. How you holding up? It's gonna be all right. Y'know, I went through something like this with my last boyfriend. Yeah, we were dating for eight months, and I was really in love with him, and then he was deported back to Iran. So, I get it. Yeah. Jesus. Um, I've been good. Not much going on. My company's 20th anniversary is next week, that's something. It's not that big a deal. I'm surprised John didn't tell you already. Seems like you guys have seen each other every day since you moved out. So, Tami, where are you from? Tell us about yourself. I'm always... fascinated to meet Ted's girlfriends. No, right, I was-- all I was doing was asking. Ted's very... attractive, I'm just always interested in the... type of girl that can snatch him up. What? No, I-- I was just asking a question. What?! It's not my fault she can't speak English. What a cunt. Huh? Well, you didn't exactly stick up for me. Yeah, well, I think you're being a little more fair to him. Y'know, your boss called this morning and asked me how my arm was. Yeah. Because of the dog fight I tried to break up. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that was some bullshit lie you made up so you could take off work and go to Ted's. Am I right? John, Ted moved out so we could give ourselves a chance without him. You're not really giving anything a chance if you're blowing off work to get high with your teddy bear. (with a bit of anger) Yes. It will. I wanna break up. I'm just... I'm done. This isn't gonna work. We're in two different places. You promised me you were gonna grow up and take our life together seriously. Jesus, he might as well still be living with us, John. You spend more time with him than you do with me. I need a man, John. Not a boy with a teddy bear. John... this really is your last chance. I can't do this anymore. Okay. Did you really just fart? Oh. Wonder where it'll hit first. Who did this to us?! God dammit! I'm here on business! (smiling at him warmly) I'm glad you're here. Play nice. Please. Sure. I want you out of the apartment... tonight. Gimme my car keys. No. I have given up a big chunk of my life for you. Just give me my keys, John! You're asking me out the day after I broke up with someone. Okay. Rex, I don't think it's smart. Fine... I guess it beats crying myself to sleep every night. Thanks so much! We're gonna take a short break, but we'll be back in a few! (turning, recognizing) Teddy!! How you doin', you fuzzy little asshole? Well, half-Indian, but thanks. (shaking his hand) Ha. Whoa, relax there, sweaty. You ready to bring down the house? Well, you're probably not used to seeing me fully clothed. Actually, you weren't so bad for a guy with no penis. Okay, I'm gonna give my chops a rest here and invite a friend of mine up to the stage. He's gonna sing a song to a very special lady in the audience who he loves very much. Let's give a big hand to John Bennett! Oh my god. Jesus. Someone call an ambulance! Yeah, I'd rather just not talk about it. Nope, I think I'd rather you just take me home. Nope, not really feeling up to it. Just to be clear, I am not embarrassed. Listen, John and I may have our problems but at least he tried. You know what? I don't feel like talking to you about this. Taking a cab. I'm going home. (pulling towel closer to her) Ted? What're you doing here? What do you want? Look, if you're here to fight John's battle for hi-- Ted... that's a very nice offer, but I don't want you to do that. This is about John and me and our problems. And I don't think it can be fixed. I'll talk to him. What... now? Alright, alright, I'll go. You can thank Ted. How are you? Well. Shall I sit? Yeah. Work's fine. There is no Rex. (a little taken aback) Wow. Thank you. I appreciate that. Hey. Kinda late to be walkin' home by yourself. Listen, John... there's something I wanna say to you, too. John, I just want you to know that... I mean, I hope you don't think that-- I, um... I just feel like we should... keep talking. Because-- What's the matter, is he all right? Where is he? Why? What happened? Can you call him back? Which way? I'm trying! I know. I know! Shit! Oh my god. (spotting the action on the Wait, John! What are you-- Oh my God... John... I don't know if this is gonna-- John... I'm sorry. You did everything you could. I'm... I'm just so sorry. (almost too softly to be Welcome back, Ted. No. I wished for my life back. Because I love you both. Yeah, that's my big brave man. I love you. (beat, she smiles) That's all I ever wanted.
