He needs to come in if he's to wash himself. So one of you is doing what the good Lord made you for. Bonjour, Lili; bonjour, Masha; bonjour, Grisha; bonjour, Tanya. Who's coming to see Grandmama? Tsk, oh . . . Stiva! . . . and Dolly found a note from the governess. Stiva wants me to come to Moscow . . . to persuade Dolly to forgive him. It's for Dolly's sake too. (a button missing) Tsk-tsk, who put this shirt on you? Never mind. I'll come and hear you read. Alexei, do you think nine years of mar- riage and children should count for nothing against a . . . an infatuation? You think of the children! Their lives are ruined now! Because that's where Aunt Dolly lives. I told you, Serozha. She's not well. I must go to see her. Now, don't make Mama cry. I'll be back before you know, and bring you a present. Oh . . . my little Kutik . . . That's better. It's the first time I've left my little boy. So you are leaving your son and I am return- ing to mine. I am Countess Vronsky. countess vronsky (cont'd) I've been in St. Petersburg for the christen- ing of a granddaughter--my elder son mar- ried Princess Chirkov. You're a charming creature. Why don't I know you? I've never been in Moscow society, really. But you know my name? I've heard you mentioned . . . Talked about, you mean. Ah, love! Was it love? Always. My sons are ashamed of me. But I'd rather end up wishing I hadn't than end up wishing I had--wouldn't you? I . . . I don't know . . . Konstantin! No! Come up! Look at me! I'm receiving for Papa and Maman who are late to dress. It's my first reception. I'm so pleased you were able to be with us, Konstantin Dmitrich! Stiva told us you were back. How long are you staying? On me? I can't. I'm sorry. It was yesterday! He is sick. I'll come back. You don't look ashamed. Charmante, don't you think? (to her Maid) Wait for me in the carriage. I'll take Tosca. Long enough for you to start a little love affair, I hear. There, Countess, you have found your son and I have found my brother. Madame Karenin has a son, too. It's the first time they have been apart, so she frets about him. We passed the time telling each other about our sons. Yes, I've been hearing all about you. Au revoir, Countess. Au revoir, my dear. Let me kiss your pretty face. Can't anything be done for them? I've you to thank for that. Have you known Count Vronsky long? Oh . . . But we should be discussing you and Dolly. What have you got to say for yourself? Don't be home late. Kitty's coming by to see you. She's all grown-up, and a bit frightened of you--the belle of St. Petersburg society! Is that who I am? Dolly . . . Stiva has told me. Dolly, I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart. My poor lamb. So you'd rather accept your fate . . . My fate? But I haven't done anything! It's him Do you love him, Dolly? You love him, and he loves you, but you can't forgive, so your lives must continue like this for ever, with both of you wretched. Grisha, don't pull so hard, you're getting it all in a tangle--and look for another G for Well, that's the end of that. Will you stay for the Bobrishchev's ball, Anna? Oh . . . I always feel dull at a ball. How can you ever be dull? Stiva! Tell Anna she must come to the ball. . . . and God go with you. She's old! She's a hundred! I know why you want me to come. You want everyone to be there because you're sure it's going to be your night. How did you know? I know everything. Oh, to be your age again . . . surrounded by that blue mist, like mist on the mountains And you also, master. He is watching. He is merciful. How can there be anything if God didn't make it? That's sinful talk if the priest heard you. Your father built the church. You're con- fessed a while yet. Will you bring me something from Moscow? Soap, the kind wrapped in paper to look pretty, and smelling like for a proper lady. You may, Boris. I'll save you the third just because it's your first ball. There. How are you, Stiva? No, ask Anna. No . . . I don't . . . Come on then. For goodness' sake, what have I done? Is anything the matter? Don't ask me, Maman! He'll dance the mazurka with Kitty, you'll see. I call the mazurka the now-or-never. I am not used to being spoken to like that by a man I met once at a railway station. Then, for Kitty's sake. You're not dancing the mazurka? I won't have it. countess nordston (cont'd) I'm engaged by General Glub--I give him to you. I didn't know you were . . . Why are you leaving? This is wrong. If you're a good man, forget everything that happened, as I will. That's enough! Is Serozha all right? Yes, quite comfortable. Count Vronsky. I? Oh--Dolly and Stiva . . . yes, I think so . . . I'll be off home if I'm in the way. Sssh . . . I'm writing to Dolly . . . and to Kitty. What new Statute? No one mentioned it. Oh, thank God, doctor--my friends say you're the only one who can save her! (to the Prince) You're not a doctor! I want to give a small dinner before the opera. Is there anyone you would like me to ask? Yes . . . Yes, the Metropolitan Bishop of St. Petersburg. The last one was to meet a missionary, the one before was for a lecture on the union of the Greek and Roman churches. I'm sorry--I know you're fond of her. Come on, or we'll be late. You didn't come to my dinner. "She" didn't come either. . . . work never ceases for great men. Your husband is a saint and we must all cherish him for Russia's sake. I hope you can come on afterwards--Father Kristof's report on the Chinese mission will be with lantern slides. I'm expected at the Tverskoys. No doubt, but I'm sure Princess Betsy can wait for you, my dear. Yes. In fact, I think I won't go to Betsy's. You're caught. Now, there's a phenomenon, look-- Anna's shadow has arrived before Anna! In my opinion Karenin is a fool, and Anna is the best of us. And we all love you for your contrary opin- ions, Princess. Alexei . . . You look desperate. That's not attractive. Hope of what? Persuading a virtuous woman to break her marriage vows? That's not attractive either. Besides, I was never virtuous. He's gone. But you're just in time for the surprise. I would prefer to try a cigarette. Thank you. I'll try another one sometime. Just as I was thinking your manners have improved since Moscow. You behaved badly, very badly. Give me a cup of tea. How nice--Alexei Aleksandrevich has arrived. I'm not sure my nerves can stand another Alexei at this moment. So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner. The sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou- bles, and it was ghastly. We had to ask them back. I gave them a sauce that cost eighty- five kopeks and it was a triumph. This must stop. You make me feel as if I were guilty of something. I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty to forgive you. If you have any thought for me, you will give me back my peace. Your husband is impossible!-- his opinions are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he wins every argument. What? No, I'm staying. Send the carriage back for me. No. I don't want you to go. Waiting up? How unlike you! What about? It's late. Where's Annushka? Well, if you want to talk, but we should go to bed. I have nothing to say to you, and I'm tired. I don't know what you're talking about, and it's really too late for this. Excuse me, please. Too late. Oh God forgive me. It's the end of everything--I've got nothing left now, only you. Remember that. Happiness! You murdered my happiness. Murderer. Murderer. Go on. Go on. Go on. Yes. Go on. Go on. Go on. There. Oh, I'm sore with his feeding! Would you like to hold him? Well, don't hold him like a parcel . . . It's Aunt Kitty, darling. . . . Little face . . . little fingers . . . look at you . . . Doesn't he make you ashamed of dwelling on your troubles . . . ? I have no troubles. That man wasn't worth the tears, believe me. I don't care about him. I don't even think about him. Or her. Except to hate her. Then we'll never speak of it again. There are better men waiting for you. Stiva says . . . Kitty, my lamb, did Konstantin Levin . . . ? What has Levin got to do with it? Anyway, I'll never get married. The whole business of . . . it's become disgusting to me . . . and look what it's done for you! Why do they call it love? Because it's love. I want you to. I don't care about it. Pooh! Who says? You're squeamish. You a soldier! Would you faint? But I'm damned anyway. You love me. Only me. Apart from Frou-Frou. But me more than your horse? Are you happy? And you love me? How much? This much? This much? This much? This much? And this much? And this much? And . . . this . . . much . . . ? So this is love. This. I've come from there. I'm distressed that you haven't taken your usual house this year. Near Princess Betsy. And . . . The Guards are in summer camp at Tsarskoe. Alexei Alexandrovich, forgive me but you are too tolerant! Your wife . . . Alexei, what is it? I'm pregnant. How can we, Alexei? Do you think my husband will make you a present of me? Leave him and be your mistress? I would never see my son again. The laws are made by husbands and fathers. Unhappiness? I'm like a starving beggar who has been given food. I unhappy? No, this is my happiness! Alexei!--you got away at last. Can you stay? Go and find Vasily Lukich. I have to change. Princess Betsy is sending her trap for me. Would you like to come?-- she's taking me to watch the race. Exquisite creature . . . you really ought to be the spoil of victory today . . . Kusolev. Done! Alexander Vronsky . . . Alexei . . . ! Stiva! What are they saying? No, leave me alone. I'll bring her home, Alexei. What? I don't understand. What are you talking about? Yes. And how was that? No, you were not mistaken. I love him. I am his mistress. I can't bear you, I'm afraid of you, I hate you. Do what you like to me. Are you hurt? I told him I'm your mistress. He thinks I can give you up and go on living. Alexei Aleksandrevich . . . congratulations. You're the only man my husband would do this for. (To Prince Tverskoy) Tell me your latest find for your library. I can tell you're happy. You've put on a little weight. Both true. Alexei . . . I can't . . . I'm sorry . . . But I'm his wife now. (she turns to him) I am having his child. Why ask me? Don't. Would you compromise me? And Lisa? No!--no. I will not live like this! Waiting hour after hour while you're drink- ing champagne with naked actresses-- don't think I don't know!--Lisa Merkalova still calls on me. Yes--I'm sorry--it's my demon, I can't help it. Did I? Well, I am! But don't worry! It won't be for long, I'll soon be out of your way--soon! No, it's true. I was told it in a dream. Yes, and I'm only going to die having your baby. Tell me it is, tell me it is. You love me. Only me. He was late. Serves him right. And you. Why do you call him my husband? He isn't my husband--he's a clock, a wooden doll-- Do you think of my honour when you're sharing whores with your Hindoo! I'll be glad to die, before you start to hate me! Put your hand there. There! Did you feel him move! I wanted to see him because . . . What are you . . . ? Alexei . . . please . . . leave me Serozha . . . ! Well, is he coming? (drily, amused) We nearly met at the Shcherbatsky's last winter. Kitty is here. Konsantin . . . what a long time since we saw each other. When? Oh, but why didn't you . . . ? I hope not--I was young and silly in those days. And you haven't changed. You Petersburgers think yourselves so de bon ton compared with dull, old-fashioned Pryachnikov's wife, naturally. Still, not many of us can say that our lover died for love! Would you die for love, Konstantin Dmitrich? Ah, an idealist! . . . but she will be nobody's wife, she'll be ruined. Alexei Aleksandrevich--look at me. You will have no peace of mind until you forgive her. It was Anna who taught me that. What is that? Do Not . . . Did. Did Not. The last word is Never. Why doesn't he come? He is kind. He will forgive me. He's here--look--look--can't you see him? I want Alexei! Why doesn't he come? Give me some water. No, I mustn't, it's not good for my little girl. Or let her have a nurse. Yes--don't bring her here, because Alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her. He's come, my dear--look there . . . Oh, what nonsense. I must be asleep, that's what it is. You think he won't forgive me but you don't know him. No one knows him except me. I'm not afraid of him now. I'm afraid of death, though. Oh, my dear. Don't look at me like that. I am not the one you think. I'm afraid of her. She fell in love with another man. I'm the real one. But I'm dying now, then she'll be dead, too. Poor man! Let him come in. Alexis! Alexis! Take your hands away from your face. Look at my husband. He's a saint! Take his hand. Alexei--take his hands away. Forgive him, too. Thank God, thank God . . . So you came. If I had died as I wanted, you would be free of your troubles at last. Look at you. You look like what you are. A laughingstock. I fancy you are to be asked to leave the regiment. I will go when I'm ready to go. A little affair with a married woman puts a finish- ing touch to a young man's education--but this morbid, selfish obsession . . . ! You have publicly humiliated a man who has devoted his life to Russia, and it will not be forgot- ten. You'd better come back to Moscow with me. You're finished here. Konstantin!--what-- ? You're not allowed to see her! No. I don't understand at all! What's the matter with you? Are you mad? Have you changed your mind? But I do love you! Oh, Konstantin! . . . and there was her husband wearing her best ballgown, rouge all over his face . . . ma chere, le scandale! . . . But I'd better tell you some regimental news . . . No--stay. I am so glad to see you. Everyone asks after you. We have been talking too much--so I'm going. Princess Betsy came to tell me . . . I don't want to hide anything from you . . . Count Vronsky asked to come to say goodbye--he's going away. I have said I can't receive him. Goodbye, my treasure. All I know is that I sent him away and it's as if I'd shot myself through the heart! I would die for him, but I won't live like this for him. When he knows about love, he'll forgive me. No . . . I can't . . . Excuse the liberty, Your Excellency . . . it's for a bonnet and some ribbons Her Excel- lency has overlooked. If you wish us to address ourselves to Her Excellency, please be so good as to tell us where we might . . . I have forced my way in! I have heard! My dear friend! Don't give way to sorrow. Our Lord Jesus Christ has you in his care. I understand. I understand everything. I am going to act. The household arrangements you can leave to me. I will come every day. I will be a second mother to Serozha. He that humbleth himself shall be exalted! You must not thank me. Thank Him whose love pours through me! I am very pleased to meet you both. No--I want to see everything. . . . and now I'm doing kitchen maid's work because Nadya's parents won't let her set foot in this house, and who can blame them!--it's indecent! I'm sorry . . . I couldn't leave him. I know I've done wrong. I couldn't go against Nikolai Dmitrich's orders . . . Good. A clean nightshirt and sheets. A towel and a clean pail of warm water. Ask Agafia for vinegar, and to prepare a bed somewhere for Masha. Wait. And bring the perfume bottle in the outside pocket of my handbag. I'm not looking. You're such an expert on love, Kostya . . . why didn't you know it when you saw it? Alexei, they're back! Here in St. Petersburg! She has written to me. My friend . . . you would be blowing on the embers of a fire which must be allowed to die . . . Let me write to her. I'm here to see Sergei Alexeyich. I have brought something for Sergei Alexeyich. I've come to see Sergei Alexeyich. Oh, my dear little boy. I won't cry. It's time for you to get dressed. And I almost forgot your present, look . . . open it . . . Darling Kutik, Maman can't stay . . . Yes, I must, and you must love Papa-- he's better than I am. When you're grown-up . . . Where's Anya? She's still asleep. Should I take your coat? Are you feeling unwell, Madame? I'm not sleeping. I can send out for something. To where? To whom? I didn't know what happened to you. Does it take all day for you to meet your brother? Does he need you more than I do? How good you are to come. You're the very first person to call on me since our return. I received a note from Princess Betsy asking me if I'd call on her between six-thirty and eight. Or was it seven? Alas, between six-thirty and seven is just when I'm unable to see her! I would love to be there if I could get a box. I see why . . . Alexei is so fond of you. Annushka! A bath. I'll come in and choose a dress. I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've done: are you ashamed for me? Why do you keep a room at the hotel? Aren't we together? Have you changed towards me? If that's the case, I don't know why you aren't coming with me. You're afraid. Well, I'm not. Anna . . . ! princess myagkaya (cont'd) Something has done you good--you look wonderful. Should we visit or stay put? Stay put. Minister! Congratulations. Come in for a moment. princess myagkaya (cont'd) Princess Sorokina and her daughter, they're from Moscow, neighbours of Countess Vron- sky, quite well off, no sons, she's a widow. princess myagkaya (cont'd) My dear, I'm a sales catalogue. Oh, Alexei . . . I'm fond of you . . . but . . . I'd call on her if she'd only broken the law. But she broke the rules. Who has made the decor? Haven't we got a programme? Colonel, would you be so kind . . . ? Thank you, how very . . . It's a disgrace! Take me home! Fetch my cloak! What are we coming to? Is this the opera house or a--or a French music hall-- ?! Yes, why don't you? Rescue her and put your seal on the fiasco. Alexei . . . you see why she must divorce. Marriage will solve everything. When will it be? But, as you saw, she isn't. That sounds like a good idea. . . . you had an excellent night! Does your mother want you to marry the widow or the child? Don't make a joke of it. If you loved me, you would have locked me in to stop me going. Go to bed. I won't sleep. Anna . . . I am very glad to see you. Are you well? How is your little one? Stiva wanted to invite you and Count Vron- sky to the house but it's impossible . . . I understand. No, no--you don't. Kitty and her husband are with us. She's in Moscow to have the baby. Kitty . . . ? Oh, tell her how pleased I am . . . ! Perhaps I'll wait a year or two. (she gulps a laugh) Oh . . . love! Yes . . . love! Don't you disapprove of me for what I've done? No. I wish I'd done the same. But no one asked me! Well . . . I wouldn't have been brave enough. (she blinks tears) Stiva, you know . . . he doesn't change . . . like all men, I suppose. Madame . . . Madame . . . Are you ill? What time is it? Is Anya up? It's afternoon, Madame. I'm all right. It's all right. Get them to bring up all our trunks and travel cases. We've been here long enough. I had an inspiration. Why do we have to wait here? Why can't we wait in the coun- try? I don't want to hear any more about a divorce, or think about it. If I bore you here, I'll bore you in the country. It's absurd to you because you have no understanding for my life here. You've stopped loving me. You've given up everything for me, and it's turned you against me. Why lie about it? Because I've been living off your love and there's none left, so this is over! Finished. I'm sorry. I don't mind when we go. You should leave me. Why? Is that your way of telling me you'll be at your mother's with that simpering little princess? Well, I know what that means. Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine in soci- ety, I won't eat with the band. Who was the telegram from? I told you I don't care about the divorce, so why hide the telegram? What else do you hide from me? Why do you care about the divorce? What has it got to do with us loving each other? You're perfectly free to marry anyone your mother wants. Yes, we are, and, by the way, compared to your mother I'm the Virgin Mary. So it's the child. Unpack everything. We're not going. Anna Arkadyeva . . . When Count Vronsky comes back, tell him . . . I don't want to be disturbed. Count Vronsky . . . ? He went out early, to the stables, he said. Oh, Annushka . . . I should have died. Do you remember? Don't take it to heart, Anna Arkadyeva . . . I've made him hate me. Tell Michael to hurry. Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina? It's all right, the mistress is giving Mitya his bath. And what was that? He's very advanced for his age. What did you understand?
