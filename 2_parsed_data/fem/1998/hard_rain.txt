Jesus H. Christ, Henry, I told you  to stay away from the damn window. We're setting traps. You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell,  are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff?  Didn't you lose an election? I sure  as hell know I didn't vote for you,  and neither did Henry. That's what they said in '73. When  we got back, anything the bastards  didn't steal they broke, just for  the hell of it. Damn right it's not. Soon as we finish setting the traps. I was setting up pumps. I wouldn't expect you to, Wayne. I was gonna go as soon as I filled  the pumps, but the next thing I know,  I've got a looter on my hands. Now,  maybe I'm crazy, but I was expecting  a little gratitude? I told you -- he was looting it. It was a crucifix. It was the only thing there! I have to fill the pumps -- Did you see the stained glass windows,  Phil? Did you see what a good job  they did? I can't let anything happen  to the church, not after all I've  put into it. If you're not going to take me back  to the church, then I'll swim. What am I saying? This is my boat. You swim. They'll get him out. I owed you -- for hitting you and  all. But we're even now, okay? I don't know. Maybe another levee broke upriver.  They've been -- Tell them where the money is. Well, I can. So what do we do? Look, I've spent the last eight months  of my life restoring that church,  and I just left it to come save your  ass, so spare me, okay? No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked  in. You ever been robbed before? Oh. What'd you do before this? How'd you end up in this? Nice favor. How's he gonna feel after  tonight? Oh, God. I'm sorry. Well, whoever it is, he listens to  Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the  soundtrack to "Footloose." What? Hurry! You so much as breathe funny and  your head is going back out that  window without you. Real slow now. Like you were in a  big jar of molasses. That's it. I've got everything under control,  Henry. You go back up. Well, isn't that just wonderful! Now  these bastards are gonna want to  kill us, too! Why the hell did you  have to come to this house? We thought it was empty. You know what? The house next door  is empty. So whaddya say we go back  downstairs and you two keep moving? Oh, we're not, are we? Then what's  your plan, General Schwartzkopf? You can't swim that far in fifteen  minutes. Henry! Henry, he is not taking our boat. Here. You want a TV too? How about  some china? Maybe our silver? Henry! Henry, you leave the boat  where it is! Watch yourself, Tom. I really don't  wanna have to save your life again. You give away our only boat in the  middle of a flood. You are a genius,  Henry. A goddamn genius. Jesus, Henry, what are you waiting  for -- a kiss goodbye? Get back in  here. I hope you're proud of yourself,  Henry Sears. I told you not to give him the goddamn  boat. We could be safe in our home instead  of out here in a boat with these low- life scumbags! Faster, Henry! The bastards might  change their minds! Stop lily- dipping  and move it! What're you doing? Henry...? Yes, of course, I -- Tom went off in their rowboat. Back to the armored truck. Stop! You'll hit Tom! Sorry, Wayne, but I'm not playing a  part in your sick little play. Or what? You'll kill me? You're gonna  do that anyway. I'm sure you can hurt me. But it's  all going to be the same when I'm  dead. Happy Birthday, Wayne. There have to be keys. There -- God, I am really beginning to hate  fine craftsmanship. I'm handcuffed. The railing's bolted to the wall. I've got a saw. In the kitchen. In the tall cupboard  beside the -- You gotta go! The dam's gone! You gotta go! Come on, Henry. Forget that "Go to  the light" crap. Come back to me.  You're all I've got. Oh, Henry. Thank God. Whatever you say, honey. No! No! Do you need any help? It's coming along. What'd you get? Yum. Ha ha. That's what he said last week. And I will.
