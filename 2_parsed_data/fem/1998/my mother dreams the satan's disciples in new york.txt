Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything. Well, I'd love to see inside your club. What about yesterday? Kicking that poor boy? I'm just concerned about my daughter. And you don't deal drugs? My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe. Is that true? Excuse me, sir. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday. Have a nice day. Oh, let me get out of your way then. Oh, please, don't hurt me. Goodbye, sweetheart. Mm hmm. I can make my own decisions. At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better. Dear, I was thinking. Why don't we go to Paris next year? I've never been. Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling. Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything. Mm hmm. I'm sorry. Aaron? Oh, I hope so, dear. If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it. Oh, that has nothing to do with it. What's wrong? My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people. Oh, it's so nice to meet you. You know, you never tell me anything. He seemed quite taken with you. But I was dusting. Well, they were right out in plain view. You know ... ... whoops! What about the fellow in those pictures? Dating anyone? How are you doing sweetheart? I just can't seem to focus on anything these days. The motorcycle gang? Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls? ... What are they all doing there? I wanted to ask you something. Those motorcycles across the street ...? Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word! Well, once you're inside, it's nice. I wonder what they do in there? Don't they frighten you? They all look so ... He's an organic farmer. You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single. Poor man had to leave town. And I hear that other women came forward. Oh, it was such a big scandal. Men ... they're all the same. Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister. Oh. You need a cappuccino. She's at work. I'm her mother. Who is it? Forty-five? I thought it was only supposed to be thirty? I see. How much? This way? You mean it's dangerous? Ohhh. Do you know the East Village? I'm from South Dakota. Where are you from? ... And the children thought I should take a trip. Uh, yes. My husband passed away recently ... She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here. I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter. I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous. It's my first time in New York. Just a minute. Are you sure you got my bag in?... Manly? Oh. Well, that would be a ... change. Thank you, Mrs. Peterson. You have a very reassuring voice. What does he do? What happened? Really? And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize. Calls made at three and four in the morning. So, I called the number ... and a woman answered. And I ... I hung up. So, then I followed him. Just like in the movies. And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn. We had been going together for almost a year. I'm sorry. I had a wretched night. Oh. I thought today was Saturday. It's Marika. Is Paula there?Well, bye. And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring! I love you, Mom. I have to run. You remembered to call the limousine service, right? Mother! Here you go. I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing. Okay? I'd love to. You wouldn't be in the way. I like having you around. I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer. It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it? Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk. You know that guy in the pictures you saw? No, I had a dream about daddy. Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him? Mom, I need to talk to you. No, no, it's my fault. I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own. Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking? Mother, I ... Don, this is my mother. Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer. That's not true. Besides, I don't want you dusting. I want you to see New York. I don't want to talk about it. I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications. Behind the books. Mother! What pictures? No, I'm working too much, I don't have time. I'm good. That's why it's good you came to visit me. I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village. I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night. That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters. Uh-huh? That's New York. It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day. You'll get used to it. You don't like where I live? So, what do you think?
