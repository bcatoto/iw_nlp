I love Antigua. Maybe I'll come visit you. And where might that be? Thanks. She's going to wash your Jeep? Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid? Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...I'm fine. Nice TV. So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters. Suzie. Then you're not her grandmother... And the child... Was there ever any kind of investigation... She still work there? Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway? Try, Kelly. You mean he withdrew... Then what? Did you try to fight him? He was large? That's okay, Kelly. You're doing fine. But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt. Was this the first time a man was inside you? Was there penetration? Did he put himself inside you? I understand. Take your time. I know you do. How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute? Suzie? You could tell me where you were last night. Ray thinks she was murdered. She didn't cone home last night. We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket. Suzie Toller is missing. Weren't you a little worried about her...? Did you call anyone? Did you call her house to see if she got home? Did you call the Masons? And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car? I'd like that. It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it. I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track... He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit. I'm tired, Ray. I'm going home. And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up? Ray, you heard him... We don't know that, Ray... Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away. And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal. Where's the body? Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth. If you want company... You have someplace to be? Ray. We don't know anything yet. She could be anywhere... We all have... You could say that. Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life. Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway? Eliminate the competition. This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it? So what about the girls? Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother? Surely her father... Why? You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life. He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing... Unless what? Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial. Lombardo's settlement? That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile. It's a pretty dismal place. You mean Camp Sixty-Nine. The skinny brunette. You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark. You know what you get? More bark. And more bark. There's no core. Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water. And now they can't get rid of them. They've tried poisons. Nothing works. They don't die. All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid. We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there. Same with the kids. They saw her running down the street, but that's it. With no physical evidence, what do we have? Her word against his. Same as him. They saw her come. They saw her go. They saw him follow. Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do. We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary. All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here. Back to the land of grownups. What was that? At that point were you able to fight him off? Did he come in with you? So you were alone. And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there? He dropped Jimmy off first? We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us. Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride? Why is that? That bothers you? You know what that will mean for Lombardo. I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years. We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers. That doesn't make him a child rapist. There's something else. This girl's had some problems. Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars. Ran away... I think she's acting. I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her. I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...I know one thing he said. It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up. He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that. He said, "No little girl can ever make me come." Not at first. He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything... He said we had this secret. And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that. I don't know. It's hard to remember, exactly. He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen." Then he just stopped. I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.' No. I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated. But this hurt... like, he was built... you know... Yes. I said stop. I screamed. I mean that's how it sounded in my head. He hurt me... He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something. I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor. They were in me. Both places... you know. The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind. His fingers... his fingers... I just want to get it over with. My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it. Shit. I think we just need to get wasted. Nothing. Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain? Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp... Oh, for Christ's sake. You can trust me. I can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you? Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me. Right? And Sam. Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere. He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it. Stay strong and he can't do shit. Will you calm down. Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him. Get off my property. Police -- God -- get a life. You're out of your mind. Excuse me? About what? How to improve your breast stroke? Is there some reason why you're here? A friend of mine bought a boat. Don't bother. I'm taking a trip. You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me... Yes. God, Mom... I was raped. By Sam Lombardo. No you don't. I miss Dad. No thanks to you. My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash. You notice my new jumper? Which one of your "bodyguards" is that? Hi, Mon. Um-huh. And guess what else? I have toys. I'm running away. No little girl can ever make me come. Say you love me. That never seemed to worry you at the Glades. Okay. I love you too. But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber... I don't know. I want to see you... I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit... I can't help it. He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him? She's not that way. I think he did something... I'm really serious. That cop, he keeps watching me. God, I've been calling you. Hello? There was no way. That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb... I'm here. You know what it takes. Why can't you come... Yes. Stick? Do it to ourselves? Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party. Of course I'm crazy. Ask my mom. How much? So you got my mom's money. Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust. How do you like that? I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you... Mr. Lombardo. We're running kind of late. How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons? You could give me a ride when you find the ticket. Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo. Aren't you forgetting something? Your coupon. We gotta have it. Where's the hose? We can set up. Look, he forgot. I knew it. Don't forget the car wash. Deal. You know, I just looked out front. My ride wasn't there. You suppose you could give me one?You okay? And the other girl, Kelly. Suzie's niece. Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child. He was a good boy, till the army took him. She had it, before she drank herself to death. Wasn't exactly a love child... Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here. He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes. One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp. That came with her. No. Not after that night. I don't know what happened. Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy. Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night. It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away. That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette. Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear. He used to come around here. He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades. About Suzie? You come all the way out here to watch Walter? Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye. He don't use it for no good deeds anyway. Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit. They see out the sides. That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.Where, the mall? I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children. I'm leaving again tonight. He... Sam Lombardo? What? He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married. Jesus. Well, I do too, sometimes... Kelly. What is it? I would hardly say you look like trash. Okay, what's the matter? Whichever one I want. Sam! Hi! Is that Sam Lombardo? You can't... Where she lives. In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about? Who is it? That's right. Grab a clue, Sam. You're a hired hand around here. Enjoy it while it lasts. Look. I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter. So what? To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday. Shit. Here we go again. Listen, Kelly skipped school. Have you talked to her? What? Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat... I'll bet. Look, Sam. Why don't you come by this weekend. We'll take the boat out... Why don't you come in, have a drink? What? You're going to drive off without even saying hi?He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come." He did say something. No. He stopped by himself. Okay? That's all. Let me go. I guess. Yes. No. Yeah. About a year ago. You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news. Yeah, maybe, a little. He was my friend at first. Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me. I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares? You wanna know something? When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette. Now they're gonna get screwed. This wasn't my idea. I said he did. Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp. He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt. Okay! He did. He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me. Now, can I go home? Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway... I wanna go home now. Yeah... okay... he did I wanna live at the beach someday. I thought we were goin' to a movie. What are you looking at? What brain? You are. You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you? I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust. Man, I wanna smoke a joint. Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me. You've got family and they've got clout. With we it's different... with me... Hey, Ray. Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's? Shoulda, coulda, woulda... Get him in the water. Davy. Shut up. Get away from me. I don't mean who you're thinking. I have other friends... I don't have to listen to this. And you can't shove me around. I have friends now... Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle? About what? That's cop bullshit. You got something against cigarettes? Then he'll be back at Blue Balls? Will they? It's Celine. He's okay. He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are. I did. At Blue Balls. Walter. He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years. I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold. I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass. What do you think, Mr. Lombardo? Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already. I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it. What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back? Trust me, the guy's dirty. He'll like it. Especially the part about offing me. Now get out of here. Go make yourself a new friend. Seems to like some of the same places you do. Funny you never met. Fuck the winch. I wanna drive. What? But then it is better this way, don't you think? No loose ends. The guy was history when he killed Kelly. You knew that. Are you mad at me? Yeah, right. But I.. Sam... How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
