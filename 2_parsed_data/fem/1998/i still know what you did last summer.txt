Then I'll call the mainland for a charter. I want off this island. Listen to me. He's here. Storm season? We haven't exchanged anything. Your what? It sure is a beautiful old hotel. You're okay. Thank god. No, you're not. I'm right here. Grab my hand. Come on, you can make it. There's no way to lock it. Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else. Then, we fight -- I've got to see. We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good. Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose. Let him go. I believe him. Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth. They never found the body. I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here... We've got to get to the radio and call for help. Karla! Cancer in a box. Nice move. It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too. Some. The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there. Not me...no way... No. No way. Don't even think about it. I miss Ray...I tried to call him. Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute -- Karla! You promised. Where is everyone? I'll ask -- I will, and you remind me of the same thing. I'm the King of the World. Oh! Then, don't. He does work hard. But, he said he'd try. He's not coming. I thought he was just... Ray, come on. I want us to be together. Okay, okay. You're right. The number's unlisted... That could break the machine. Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here? Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers -- No. There's nothing between Will and me. I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings. I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed. That was heart attack time, Karla. What are you doing in my closet? What are you doing in my closet? You know me to well. I love it here. Never do that again. Ray...what are you doing? Ray...please try. I really miss you. Okay. Bye. Will you try...for me, please? We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and... You know... Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her. It's okay. No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one -- It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be. It just isn't. I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand... Ray, I can't... Why are you being like this? Ray, we're just friend. Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him. Wait, it's Nancy -- I don't know. Voodoo. Ben Willis. We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one. I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there. Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature. ...Why? I trusted you. Why are you doing this to me? He's in it with Willis? Did you get help? I wasn't dreaming. There was a body! I swear it! It's in my room! Are you sure? I really appreciate it. No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry. No, no, no. This was really sweet... Oh, Will! I'm sorry. He did something to the screen...it, it, said... It's...him. Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore. It beets being on the mainland. You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning. Deep breaths -- Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood. What? I'm okay. Right. Now I remember. I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place. It was one year ago... It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school. I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months. It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me. I'm fine. I'm fine.What the hell would you call this? What about a radio? Wait...Did you say off-season? Julie, we're talkin' suites! That'll be just fine with us. Is that bad? Checking in...Karla Wilson. Is he? Oh, god, it's you -- ...Nancy? I'm holding your hand! Julie? I don't know... What do we do? It's too late for that. I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood. Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place. Be careful, Julie. I know I don't want to stay in here. What do you mean? Come on, Julie. You saw his room. Julie... Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here. I think we can classify this as an emergency situation. Just kidding. No, this is the safe sun. It's better than a day at the beach. I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it. Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress? You get any sleep at all? Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see? Yes. Yes. Okay, I won't. Karaoke -- perfect. He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... But... I also promised Tyrell. Their stuff in there... ...and ours in here. Hello? Hello? Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years. No, I'm the King of the World. Hey, sorry... He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste. Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can. And I don't want to have to say I told you so... He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing! Julie, you left four messages... Four. You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas? I know it, and it feels good. Hi, Ty. Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt. Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact. Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway. No means yes. Say yes. Yet. Nothing yet. Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street. Yeah, right -- whatever. No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time. i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them! I thought you were out of town! I thought you were out of town! You think that's a good place to hide? Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree? Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own. We gotta get out of here. Now. Hey -- I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle. Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet. You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie? 'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this. Tha's it. I've decided. I'm changing my major to finance. And going to Wall Street. They all start to look the same once you've worked in one. Am I right, sister? Rio, baby! Oooh, the mainland -- Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true. I wanted you all to have a good trip. Honey, some folks just can't fly. Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on. Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance. If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it. I don't think so. It's pretty crowded. Why? He can't help us. How's Julie? Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James. To a great weekend -- I said we start having fun. And that means now. Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh! No. Yes? Rio de Janeiro! Still here...thinking... You mean Brazil, the country? Yes! Well, I'm in school and -- Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson. Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up. I've never seen a dead body before. You stumbled into my hiding place. I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this -- Cool. What's going on? No. I shot him. Not anymore. Wanna drink? You guys lost?
