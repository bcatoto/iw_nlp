Why? Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point? Why? How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go? I can't do this. I can't leave you... I don't care! We'd be together. One more time. Show me again. Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to -- I won't ask you to. What?! This is Mr. Booker, Robert. You missed a button. I am comfortable. Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese. How did you find out all that? That's very important to you, isn't it? Home. We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be. It is. It's lovely. Why didn't it work out? How did you meet her? Son? How long did you live here with your wife? OK. Yeah. Thanks. Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas... Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill? Poor thing. The answer's no. I can handle it! Shit. You too. Are you shy, Mr. Booker? She did? He's beautiful. Oh yes. I forgot. I have a way with animals. I thought you lived in Chicago? I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts. I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine. If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies... I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run. I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat. Well, I, uh... you didn't... You were married to a woman in Chicago? You lived in Chicago? Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain. Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world? It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to. That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me. You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger. You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that? What? Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron. It is cocktail hour yet? Branding? I haven't branded in years. Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim? Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later-- Well, that'll be a little complicated -- Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim? You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check. Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again! I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the... -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal? Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car. Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's... Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel... It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs. Mr. Booker, if I could just ex -- I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class. Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner... Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number. I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly -- I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized -- This is Annie MacLean. Go ahead... Hi. How's everything? Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful. Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home. What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim? Let's bring your bags inside. Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me? What? Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity. I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you. That's not true. What?... Oh baby... When? Tonight? Started what? What did you say? Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not. Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry. But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong. I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be. WHAT?! How can you -- I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you. STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!! Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing... I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and -- Grace, I don't hate your father. What are you talking about? Honey, nobody's trying to cure you -- Well... So you tried riding again? Grace? Is everything all right? Can we talk? Did you go riding? Thanks, honey. Does anybody out there want something to drink? You're right. Good. Well, one was for salad... Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way. No. I just thought... forget it. Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight? You got everything you need? Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you? You already did. Hi. He's still sitting in that damn field. There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it? Don't they believe in signs here? You buckled up? You cold? It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers. That's not true! Did he tell you that? That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this. I don't believe this! Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you! Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you? You know what I mean? Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on? How long is this going to go on? This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this. I don't care. Would you like to see that? You don't. Oh. You didn't tell me. You should call your dad before it gets too late. Fine! IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!? Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine. No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough -- You want to take your bath? We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to -- What? Yeah? I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it. Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down... Have you decided about Pilgrim? Grace, I put it on the table near your -- I brought it to you in the hospital. It's still early. What's your next class? You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out. Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well... Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what -- Oh, honey... What happened? Dad'll pick you up today, all right? Why don't you go lie down? Liz is taking care of him. The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can -- Uh, yes... Sure, David. What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me? Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything. Exactly... David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you? Yes. We're suing. Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you. David? Where to? I have so much to tell you. Mmm. I made good time. Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow. What do you mean? Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"? I don't understa- What do you mean? Yeah, what? Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark. Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut? Let's not talk about that now. No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right. You don't have to explain. You have every right to come. You're allergic to hay. Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise. About what? Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her. Everything all right. Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off. Night. I know. We miss you too. Okay. You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know. Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new. Well, it's good that you're there. Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit? No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right. She will if you think she should. Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her. I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it! I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will. I can't say he's been all that effective with her. Why?! I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer... He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride. I'm not asking you to. I'll do it. No. I was just researching. Calm down. I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way... Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her. He did, but... I think I can change his mind. About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses... No. Yeah. Why did you go? How was the dinner? Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time. You've got to stop doing that? Do you? Do you really? Aw... that's so sweet. You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early. Sing it to me, Frankie! Oh. Right. I'll call him. Okay. We're very lucky. No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up. I should go get some of her things. What did he say? Tch. What are you -- Robert, you leave it up these people...! That bag's almost empty. What about Grace? Yeah. Bye. I don't know. We'll figure it out. I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone. Sure... What's Grace up to? I should be in by two. Hi. It's me. What choice!!? It's so cruel. Absolutely. I made enough for an army. Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager? Oh, I don't know... You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows... I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to... do their... work. You too, Diane. Promise. It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks. I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for. Between you and me, I could use the time alone. Oh, how sweet. No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list. Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping. I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want. What? Sounds like something Tom would say. Frank's a good man. Did you always know this was the life you wanted? Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to. No, it's more like a leave of- Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me. Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud. You and Frank ever take a vacation? But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time. I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe. Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was... I was there for that shot, actually. Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to. Thank you. You're all doing too much. I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one? She calls him Tommy... Where does this go, Diane? It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel. Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose. Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture? Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him. Of course not. Maybe we should give him another sedative. And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem! I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay? Please. ... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is -- - See, what you can do for him --... Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so -- Well, of course, right... Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive... Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.Good luck to you, Annie. Promise? Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing. I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart. Well, I am going to go after lunch. He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land. Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time. Yes, it does. They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all... I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us. Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home. You don't seem to upset? They fired you? Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh? Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there. I'd love to go there one time... What was it like? I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt? No reason you should, no reason you should. I'll help you with the coffee. Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway. Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise. Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same. Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's... Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom... Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow. How's Peterson's holding up for you? No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place. Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner? Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah. Sure. Does your daughter want to come inside? There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom. Frank's touchy about his cousins. Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean. Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room. I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter. You! They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy. What? I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long. ... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way... You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen! Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve? I have some brownies left over. Want one? Ain't brain surgery. Ha... Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York. What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.Great! Good. So do you. Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye. Tom's gone. Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves... Sure. Who is it? So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway... I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be... Why should they? Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will. Who's going to want me now? I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom. My period. I said... I started. LEAVE ME ALONE!! Yeah, well, you've done a great job. FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman! Well, now you know what it feels like. NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom. Yeah, you know everything!! Tom? I can't remember the last time you made him dinner. You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much. ... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home? Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?! About what? Nothing. I'll take care of it. Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork. I thought there were too many forks on the table. I'll come. Why? There's no food in the house? If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy. Did he mention it? Did you ask him to come visit? We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you. Dad wants to talk to you. I think they call it a pasture. I didn't see it. What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock." Gee, this looks like a fun place. Little. No, you just act like you do. Then why do you want to leave? He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him. You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom! You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to. You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it! Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something! What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it! What? You were never thirteen, Mom. I don't care. I didn't know I had to. I already did. This morning. When you went running. Fine. Whatever you want. I don't care. -- enough time tomorrow. I know. Fine -- I'll take my bath. I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me? Maybe they should put me down too. Mom? I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that. What about him? Doesn't matter. No, you didn't. I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India. Fine! Is that your version of a pep talk? I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home! Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all. Okay. I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough. I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!! You know, you're a good kid. I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody. Of course I have. Would you let me ride your horse? Why do you always wear that hat? Don't you go to school? No! No, you're only going to hurt him some more. I want to watch. What does that mean? Sure. I can't... not yet... I know where he goes. Are you afraid of anything? We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him. I don't know if I can. I don't know if I can with my leg. I can't... Drive? I'm not old enough yet. That's not a question, is it? Isn't it like, obvious? Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK? She's an editor. Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day. Yeah? Jude, you okay? No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"... You want to go down or stay along the river? Do you want to go around by the old road? ...Oh, come on! You think the same thing! Can I come? I'll start a fire... So? You want to go to a movie tonight? I did. He said he had work to do until late. Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom? Did you notice -- no cane? I want to see Pilgrim. NO! Maybe... look -- just... No, I'm just not that hungry. Dad! I can do it, OK?! How's Pilgrim doing? Have you heard from Judith's parents?I'm okay... I'm okay. "... and I said that"... We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back. Why don't we just cut through the woods? I just could never say it! My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger. I thought your mom's coming up? It's warmer than I thought.Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio. Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case? It isn't right to make him suffer... Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same. I understand, but Annie, please... Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain... Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim. Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?Honey... I was always good. Does a horse miss a saddle? Long enough. What are you looking at, young man? The number's by the phone. Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up. Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for. Fit? You want to check my teeth. Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner? I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time. Hey, darlin'.What do you mean? About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders? Where did you learn all this stuff?
