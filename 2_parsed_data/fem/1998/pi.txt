Max, Max! Can we do one? Jenna! Jenna! What's three hundred  and twenty-two times four  hundred and ninety-one. Right. Jenna... Okay, seventy-three  divided by twenty-two. Maximilian Cohen, please. Mr. Cohen? Hi. my name is Marcy Dawson.  I'm a partner with the predictive  strategy firm Lancet-Percy. Can I  speak with Mr. Cohen, please? Mr. Cohen! How  are you? It's been a long  time. Sorry I haven't been in  touch. But I was hoping you  would allow me to take you to  lunch tomorrow, say one  o'clock? We're very anxious to talk  with you, sir I'm prepared to  make you a generous... Mr. Cohen, give  me a moment... Max, good! Your hair. Your hair, you can't go  out like that. Don't worry. You need a mom. Your somosas! You stopped? Oh God... Farrouhk! Mr. Cohen. Marcy  Dawson here again I was just  looking over my schedule and  I realized I'll be in your  neighborhood tomorrow around  three. Marcy Dawson from  Lancet-Percy I'm so anxious  to meet you. It will be worth  it�for both of us I promise.  See you at your house at  three, okay? Oh, don't worry,  I got your address from  Columbia. So three it is.  Looking forward to it. Stop thinking, Max, just  feel. Use your intuition.  It's the only way to get into  the flow.  What did you think of Hamlet? It's been a month.  You haven't taken  a single break. Have you met the new  fish my niece bought me? I  named her Icarus. After you.  My renegade pupil. You fly  too high, you'll get burned. The more I see you, the  more I see myself thirty  years ago. My greatest pupil.  Published at 16, Ph.D. at 20. But life isn't just  mathematics. I spent forty  years looking for patterns in  Pi, I found nothing. I found things, but not a  pattern. Your mainframe? What happened? You have a printout? The picks, the number? What was the number it  spit out? How many? What was it, a  hundred and fifty, a  thousand, two hundred  sixteen!? How many? I dealt with  some bugs back in my Pi days.  I was wondering if it was  similar to one I ran into. Have you met Archimedes.  The one with the black spot.  You see? Remember Archimedes of  Syracuse? The King asks  Archimedes to determine if a  present he's received was  actually solid gold. Unsolved  problem at the time. It  tortures the great Greek  mathematician for weeks.  Insomnia haunts him and he  twists and turns on his bed  for nights on end. Finally,  his equally exhausted wife,  she's forced to share a bed  with this genius, convinces  him to take a bath, to relax.  While stepping into the tub  he observes the bathwater  rise as he enters. Displacement.  A way to determine volume.  And thus, a way to  determine density, weight  over volume. And thus,  Archimedes solves the  problem. He screams  "Eureka!"�Greek for "I found  it!"�and is so overwhelmed he  runs dripping naked through  the streets to the King's  castle to report his  discovery. Now, what's the  moral of the story. Wrong. The point of the  story is the wife. Listen to  your wife, she will give you  perspective. Meaning, you  need a break, Max, you have  to take a bath, otherwise  you'll get nowhere. There will  be no order, only chaos.  Go home and take a bath. Mr. Cohen! Perfect timing. I was just waiting for you.  I thought you stood me up,  so I was going to head home. Oh...Marcy Dawson. From  Lancet Percy. We were  supposed to meet at three. I can't tell you what a  pleasure it is to finally  meet you. I've studied  your papers for years. I have something  you won't be able to say no  to. Why don't we take a spin  in the limo? We're excited by your work.  We can't wait to discuss... Farrouhk? Max, is everything all  right? Iodine...did you cut  yourself? Ah, science, the pursuit  of knowledge. One second. Here we are. What are you  examining� a potato!? The neighbor's up  to his old science... Next door. Shh! I just helped ... Farrouhk! Shh! C'mon, Farrouhk. Shh! Baby! Come here, baby! Humph. Max? Relax, it's early. Now, what's up? Excuse me? Oh, you mean the bug. I  found it working on Pi. What's this all about,  Max? Religious Jews? Really? What's it mean to  them? It's just a coincidence. Yesterday's stock picks? Hmmm. Max, it's a bug. Come with me. Listen to me. The Ancient  Japanese considered the Go  board to be a microcosm of  the universe. Although when  it is empty it appears to be  simple and ordered, in fact,  the possibilities of game play  are endless. They say that no  two Go games have ever been  alike. Just like snowflakes.  So, the Go board actually  represents an extremely complex  and chaotic universe. That is  the truth of our world, Max.  It can't be easily summed up  with math. There is no simple  pattern. So? That is insanity, Max. Hold on, you have to slow  down. You're losing it, you have to take a breath. Listen  to yourself. You're connecting  a computer bug I had, a  computer bug you might have  had, and some religious  hogwash. If you want to find  the number two sixteen in the  world, you'll be able to pull  it out of anywhere. Two  hundred and sixteen steps  from your street comer to  your front door. Two hundred  and sixteen seconds you spend  riding on the elevator. When  your mind becomes obsessed  with anything, it will filter  everything else out and find  examples of that thing  everywhere. Three hundred and  twenty, four hundred and  fifty, twenty-three.  Whatever! You've chosen two  sixteen and you'll find it  everywhere in nature. But  Max, as soon as you discard  scientific rigor, you are no  longer a mathematician. You  become a numerologist. What  you need to do is take a  break from your research. You  need it. You deserve it  Here's a hundred dollars, I  want you to take it. If ,you  won't take it, borrow it.  Either way, take a break. Spend it however you like as  long as it falls in the  category of vacation. Real  world stuff, okay. No math. Just try it. In a week  you'll laugh about this.  C'mon, Max. Think about it! Mr. Cohen? Mr.  Cohen? Please stop for a  second Mr. Cohen? I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.  I admit I've been a bit too  aggressive. But all I ask is  for five minutes of your time.  Here... ...a stopwatch.  Already ticking. Allow me the  four and a half minutes left  Let me tell you what I want.  Let me tell you what I can  offer you. Afterwards, if you  don't want to talk to me, then  fine, we part as friends and  I promise that you will never  see me again. That's fair,  isn't it? Good. It's funny,  even though we have different  aims and different goals  we're actually incredibly  alike. We both seek the same  thing�perfection. I know... clearly we're seeking  different types of  perfection, but that is what  makes us perfect candidates  for a fruitful partnership.  If you let me, I can be your  greatest ally. Take the  acacia tree...in East  Africa. It is the most  prevalent plant in all of  Kenya because it has managed  to secure its niche by  defeating its major predator,  the giraffe. To accomplish  this, the tree has made a contract  with a highly specialized red ant.  The tree has evolved giant spores which  act as housing for the ants  In return for shelter, the  ants supply defense. When a  giraffe starts to eat the  tree's leaves, the shaking  branch acts like an alarm. The  ants charge out and secrete an  acid onto the giraffe's  tongue. The giraffe learns its  lesson and never returns.  Without each other, the tree  would be picked dry and the  ants would have no shade from  the brutal African sun Both  would die. But with each  other, they succeed, they survive,  they surpass. They have  different aims, different  goals but they work together. Max, we would like to establish  a mutually benefiting alliance  with you. Allow me to dose. As a sign of good faith we  wish to offer you this. The suitcase isn't filled with  fifties or gold or diamonds. Just  silicon. A Ming Mecca chip. You're right. They're not. But  Lancet-Percy has many friends.  Come here, take a look. Beautiful, isn't it? You know  how rare...are you okay? But what about... What? Mr. Cohen!? Max, Max, can we do one. Please, Max. Mr. Cohen? I'm so  Happy... You tech guys. I think you  know what we want. C'mon, Mr. Cohen. We can work  together We can both profit  from this information. We both  need each other to get it, so why  not work with us? We're willing to take the risk. Done. Anything else? How do I know you're home? Fair enough. He's just a bit unique. He's alive. His eyes are moving. Yes, hello? He's busy right now I'm sorry. Max is sprawled out in front  of Euclid. A large amount of  blood, from his nose, is  semi-dried on his chin and  chest. Devi hangs up the phone. You were screaming... Who told you you can put extra  locks on the door. You're out, you hear me, you're out.  I've had enough of you. Look at all  this junk. Are you okay? What is this stuff? What does it do? That's it, no way. You're  the one out of here, mister. Are you okay? Max, is that you? Max?  Max, just talk to me. Things  are a bit out of hand down  here. People are getting  desperate.  We had a deal, Max. A deal.  Talk to us, Max. You're early. I was just  studying our... What did you do to yourself? I thought you were going  to take a break. You have it? Okay, sit down. I gave up before I  pinpointed it. But my guess  is that certain problems  cause computers to get stuck  in a particular loop. The loop  leads to meltdown, but  right before they crash they... they become "aware" of  their own structure. The  computer has a sense of its  own silicon nature and it  prints out its ingredients. In some ways...I guess... No, Max, it's only a  nasty bug. A door in front of a cliff.  You're driving yourself over  the edge. You need to stop. The bug doesn't only  destroy computers. Look what it did to your  computer. Look what it's doing  to you. It's killing you. Leave it  unknown. Max, I got burnt. It caused my stroke. Max, there's more than  math! There's a whole world... Max, it's death! Get out! Max, get out! Out! Let's take a ride, Max. We had a deal! NOW get in the limo! Enough, Max, c'mon out. You're responsible for this. But we did. You have to be careful  where you throw out your trash. You gave us faulty information.  You gave us the carrot, the right  picks, but then you only gave us  part of the code. C'mon, Max. This isn't a  game anymore. We're playing  on a global scale. We used  your code. Foolish...I admit.  But we can fix things if we  make some careful picks. Give  us the rest of the code so  we can set things right. Look, Max... Information is  the private language of Capital. We tried to  establish a symbiotic  relationship but if you choose to compete and  enter our niche we are forced  to comply with the laws of  nature. C'mon, Max. You  don't get it. I don't give a shit about you. I only  care about what's in your  fucking head. If you won't help  us help yourself, then I'll  have only one choice. Destroy the  competition. I'll take you  out of the game. Survival of the  fittest, Max. And we've got  the gun. Can I help you? Were you a friend? He had a second stroke. Max. Max! Are you  okay!? Oh my God, Max! Max! Breathe, Max. Breathe! Yes, Max. Listen to me... Breathe, Max! Breathe.  Focus. No, Max. No.  Stay with me Max. Stay with  me. That's right Max. That's  Right. Breathe. Breathe. Yes, breathe, Max.  Breathe... Max, Max! Can we do one, Max, can  we? How about two hundred  and fifty-five times a  hundred and eighty-three. I got it! I got it!  What's the answer? Forty-six thousand six  hundred and sixty-five.
