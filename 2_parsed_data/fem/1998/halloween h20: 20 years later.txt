Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again. Thanks for your concern. Goodbye. I never stop thinking about it, Detective. The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times. ... I think it would be best if you both left. Detective... I'd prefer you didn't. I'm very busy. Do I know you? Think Eddie had something to do with it? Do you know who did this? My god... A dead body? Bruce... what's going on? The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival. That would work. Call me Laurie, will ya? Please, get on the bus... John... John, you can't help her now. Just get on the bus. Get on the bus. Where are you going? I was trying to protect you from this... No. Yes. Afraid not. You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family. I was trying to get away from someone. Will, sit down... Oh, so now it's my fault? It's an option. Wrong. There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not. You're kidding with that answer, right? Shit, John! What the hell were you doing out there?! I know. I thought you'd never ask. Where are you going? I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want? My point exactly. See, we both agree. Forget it. You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top. Somehow his opinion doesn't count. No. And I should have a son who calls me "Mom". Looks like we're both shit out of luck. Betcha' didn't predict that. Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no." Who?! Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night. Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what? We've got to get these kids out of here... I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things. Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will. Yeah. Are you going to leave, too? Shit happens. No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking. It's the truth. He's my brother. Michael Meyers. My name hasn't always been Keri Tate. It was once Laurie Strode. There's something I have to tell you both. It's going to sound strange... I'm fine. I just need to lie down... What? Bye Will. I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark. Need anything? Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie? It's not going to happen. He's been living out of moving boxes for three months. It's always John. Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix. Looks great. It does.Can't you? I have to pee. Wait. Look, they're staring right at us. Oh, don't be such a victim. Let the party begin. Very insightful. Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria. Thanks! Nope. Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume? You're so easy... BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH! Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing. I'll pop a Benadryl. Shane's going as a condom. Ooooh, busted. Better her than me. You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl. Fuckin' A. You aced it, didn't you?Yeah. I'm okay. I guess. It's just hard to believe. You really think Eddie killed her? Alright. I'll come out. Just be quiet. Then I'll get caught. Are you crazy? You'll get caught. I can see that. Why? What are you doing here?! Is that all you guys can think about? Amy never came back last night. Maybe she's in trouble. I can't afford to get caught. Not me. You stole it? Where'd you get it? Michael Meyers! Linda! He killed Linda! Okay... thank you. I know. I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate. Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here. Have enough fun for the both of us. But the dance is in the gymnasium. Where's Shane? Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus. Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?! Shit, Linda! You think they'll let him in dressed like that? I thought you were allergic to latex. Big time. And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight. You're unbelievable. What's this? He gave me a fuckin' A? Wow. I did alright.My office? Nothing's missing? You sure? No. Wait for the police. Jimmy, what are you doing? No shit. I think someone broke into my house. My blood pleasure. You scared the hell out of me.
