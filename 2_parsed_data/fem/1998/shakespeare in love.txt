God bless you! Be good to her, my lord! Be patient, my lord, she is dressing. It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord. Lady Viola is pious, my lord. My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell. He looks well enough for a mountebank. Your mother, and your father Verona again. As a nurse. Like Valentine and Silvia? Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight. Playhouses are not for well-born ladies. Be still. When the Queen commands it. I liked the dog, for laughs.But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true. Above Lord Wessex? And--? They are not acted for you, they are acted for me. Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love? What do you love so much? I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond. Stand up straight, girl. Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA. Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts. How much was the wager? As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder. Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon? There was a wager, I remember�as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today. You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?Will! Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart. You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again. When will you write me a sonnet, Will?Every word. Thomas Kent! What happened to Sam? No Juliet?! I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor. I am sorry, Will. Nobody knew! You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig! Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming. From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome? A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King! He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona. But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players. No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play. I will have love or I will end my days as a . . . All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all. I am not so well-born. But at the playhouse. Nurse? But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another? Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks. Oh, but they can! And I love poetry above all. I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed Your Majesty Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Write me well. Nor you for me. I don't know. It's a mystery But all ends well. But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?�she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke�Orsino. An excellent beginning Let him be�a duke. And your heroine? The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night. If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier. It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise. A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love. "I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day." "It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die." Will you read it for me? But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified. If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare. You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come. I love you, Will, beyond poetry. Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet. You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed. You lie. You never spoke so well of him. Will! What--? Stage fighting! Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday. You cannot, Wessex will kill you You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go. What will you have me do? Marry you instead? Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season. Oh, but it will end well for love? That's my line! Oh, Will! Oh, do not go It is broad day! The rooster tells us so! Oh--no, no! Mr. Henslowe? It was the owl--come to bed Moonlight! You would not leave me? And that was only my first try. Even your play. I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play. I do not know how to undress a man. Then kiss me again for I am not mistook. Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare? Can you love a player? Oh, not for the world! If they find you here they will kill you. Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart. Oh but why "alas?" Anon, good nurse. Anon. Master Shakespeare?! Who is there? He is dead? Mourning? Who is dead, my lord? It is to be expected on a Sunday. I am going to church. It is not my riding day, my lord. I mean�Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can Good morning, my lord! I will do my duty, my lord. The Queen has consented? But why me? Virginia?! I do not love you, my lord. Do you intend to marry, my lord? You flatter, my lord. Lord Wessex. You have been waiting. So my lord? I speak with him every day. My lord."Out of her favour where I am in love." "Out." "Not having that which, having, makes them short." "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?" "Is the day so young?" "The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine." "O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?" I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here. "She speaks. "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek. "Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again." "Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd." "Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair." "�Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute! But what of Lord Wessex? I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player? What of her bosom? She sings too? And her voice? Like lark song? And her lips? Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat. Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful? Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will. I � Her letter came to me by the nurse. Does she say so? It is only ours you can know. If you love her, you must do what she asks. I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two. No, sir. Yes, sir. Are you Mr. Shakespeare? I . . . My hat? Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
