Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ... He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test. Three days. Peter ... Fear ... Hope... Secret ... Nature ... Flower ... Love... Black... Red ... I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ? Blue ...Would that I could say the Same. So I'm still ... How long have I been here? ... love ... ... love ... ... love... ... preserve... ... power ... ... death ... ... death ... Knight ... ... head ... ... bottle ... Sir August...? What now? Promised? Who promised? Have we met? I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it? I've come to apply for membership in Brolly -- Really -- what happened in 1922? I have an appointment. As you see. Impossible? Mr. John Steed, please. Then who wins? Rules are made to be broken. This isn't a game. Your voice -- it's so familiar ... Quite a collection. Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ? Thank you, Steed. Next assignment? So am I. To find out who killed my husband. Who? The Institute ... the funding ... To you ... ? I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that. What are you trying to do to me? Watch me. I resign. After the cold war ... Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible. He tried to warn us ... Ropes? How curious ... Let me guess -- 'Father'? Hmmm ... I'll never marry you. What are my choices? How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter. Then what's stopping you? The result would be ... Such as? You're mad. Ring? Valentine, listen to me ... I'm already married ... 'Our revels now are ended.' But -- why? But I found you. All the clues led me here ... Too many cooks -- You killed my husband. Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ... You. Thanks, Valentine ... Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby? Pity your mother came, too ... Our little paradise -- just made for two? I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed. Have you any place in mind? Still a bit chilly ... '... in a beautiful pea green boat...' What kept you? If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't -- But -- You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect. Where are you going? Have a look at this. 'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception? Trubshaw again? What now? Shall we? When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit. What is it? It's called Black Leather. Have we been invited? Hurry? What for? I'm just now -- Aren't you coming? Why's he called 'Invisible'? I'm a wanted woman, I know ... Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody. ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children. No idea who. No idea why ... You lied. As far as you trust me. No, after you. Please don't tell me it's how you play the game. I'm playing to win. I thought you played by the rules. You're playing games. But you did suspect me. Is that all? Mmm ... what are you doing? It wasn't me; you have my word. And do you trust me? Yes ... ? Because you always obey orders ... I could save you the trouble. To kill me? You followed me. It was Peter -- I saw him ... Was I? Where am I? Steed ... ! Someone didn't want us to get to the party. This must be the last straw. Barely. Have I trespassed on a male prerogative? We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ... Is that what you think? Not that I know of. Explanation? Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ... Three agents killed by bad weather... That's what we were working on. Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ... The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'... Not quite. This is my field. But Thanks ... I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello? She had this in her mouth. There, there... Is that written in his shoe? Any ideas? Very good, Steed ... How on earth can you tell? I should have thought that was obvious ... I'm in mourning. You mean my other self ... Did you say formal? I must dress. No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this. That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised. But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style. You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead. Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you. I mean your man Trubshaw. Your bullet-proof waistcoat. I thought you were just overdressed. You were very lucky. Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank. You should be dead. How do you feel? So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How? Any other vices? June, July ... August? An eccentric recluse? No thanks. I have no choice. Why should you risk your life? Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking. How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work? Do we always follow Mother's instructions? Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first? That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know. And I suppose you're the knight. But why? What's the point? You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk? That place is so absurd, so out of date ... You can but I wish you wouldn't ... Steed, we really must be -- Or half cocked. I thought we were on our way. Do you? I had a feeling you would. Touche! My father always wanted a boy. A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating? We're not here to talk about the weather, surely. Mother? And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you? Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel. And just what is the game? Rules are made to be broken. Whereas you are. So what was all this -- some sort of test? 1922. Why the kippers? I had a spot of bother at the door. And you must be Steed. Please don't get up. Decontamination -- ? You don't believe him? Where's Mother? You're saying I have no choice. I'm no spy -- where do I fit in? I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed? I shall need a small plane. Let me guess: Wonderland Weather. ... and now? Well, I can't possibly go like this. I fail to see -- Getting to what? Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd. Who's now vanished. Surveillance? By whom? I know all this. Peter's brother? But -- I see.Choices? Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel. The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle. With this ring my plan will be complete. One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring. Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure. Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples... Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air. Entirely. On the other hand Mad people get things done. Let me show you -- That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ... Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring. You know, I believe she's actually jealous. Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here. Think of this as your second wedding feast ... Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ... You disappoint me, Emma. Can't you guess? For you. It was all for you ... Of course. I planned that, too. Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ... For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ... An unholy trinity ... A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ... Darling Emma -- yes, we: the true genius behind the Prospero Project ... Good luck ... Peter ... Emma. Ugh ... Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for -- Aren't you forgetting about something? You said ... one shot. If you say so. That's not playing by the rules. You wish. But did they teach you this? You're better than I expected. The last one you'll ever see. John Steed.
