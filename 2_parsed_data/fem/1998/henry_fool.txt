Where the hell have you been? Mom, come on and eat. I'm not hungry. Then why'd I cook! I don't know why you cooked! I don't  know why you bother! Sit down and eat, Simon. God, I wanna get fucked. You OK? See ya later. Say something. What? Kiss my ass. Did you throw up all over some girl? They were throwing bottles at the  house. She's got some ex-con in there she  met at the bar. Tattoos all over  himself and a big red bloated nose. What's the use? She might as well  get it while she can. She's not always  gunna have the ass she has now, you  know. That's just how life is. Take me home. Shit, Mom, we gotta get him to a  hospital! Oh, shut up! Turn around. This kinda thing has happened before. How do you know? Stop that. Keep still! Fine! You do it, Simon! I don't care! Mom! Simon's got a broken rib, his  shoulder's dislocated or something,  and he won't let me disinfect the  gash in his head! Fay, just take him to the hospital,  will ya! But he won't go! Simon Grim, you go to the hospital  with Fay right now, do hear me! So, do you have, like, you know, a  girlfriend, Henry? Do you find me attractive? I look young for my age, don't I? How old do you think I am? How young? But how... I mean, do I look more  like twenty, or... you know, thirty? Listen, you geek, after a couple of  drinks plenty of people mistake me  for eighteen! Hey, Warren, are you a registered  voter? It's everything you need to know  about the upcoming elections and  congressman Owen Feer and all the  really good things he wants to do  for our country. He wants to win back this country  for us Americans, Warren, and restore  some kind of cultural-moral standard  to our way of life. Nine o'clock. Well, I don't know, Warren. I mean... How dare you put something like this  up where anyone can see it! It's pornography! The product of a  diseased mind! You oughta be ashamed  of yourself, Mr Deng! It's disgusting! There oughta be a  law or something! What are you doing there, Simon? Pardon me, Simon. Uhm. Look, ah... I'm the editor of  the high school newspaper now and... One of the editors, and we... I... wanted to know if we could print  your poem in this month's issue. Because I think it's great. Please? Ma, you take your medication? Guess so. What do you want? Well, leave 'em there on the counter,  then. Where is he? Henry? Mommy!!!!! You bastard! Get out! That man's a bad influence. Oh, shit! Not you again! Yeah! Get outta here, you freak! Eat shit and die, Henry! Beast! Fiend! Rapist! Oh, shut up, Mom! Oh God, really I don't know. Thanks, sure. I gotta go, thanks. Don't you dare talk that way to me!  And keep your hands off my brother.  Pearl, what are you doing here? You and Vicky get back together? I saw this retard on TV this morning. Keep dreamin' Warren. The guy's a  Nazi. Gimme a light. You still sell dope? Come on, Pearl, let's go play at my  house. I'm not saying you did, I'm just  saying one was and since you do have  this criminal background... Don't you even come near me! What do you mean, you quit? Why! Like what? Are you drunk? I am not gettin' a job! Who's gunna look after Mom! Pearl, go outside. Simon, don't be retarded... Mom can't be left alone with no one  to keep an eye on her. What happened to her, Simon? How did  she get this way? Will it happen to  me too? Huh? Why are we so fucked  up? What's up? I'm creating my r�sum�. This  computer's got a program especially  for it. I bought some special  stationery too. It's scented. Look. It's roses. That's your poem? Simon, Mom's right about you. A poem's  supposed to be a small, delicate  kinda thing. Kinda feminine. Gentle.  Look at this. You've made a fuckin'  telephone book. Gnoc, gimme a value pack of Kleenex,  will ya? I would have said Dickinson, maybe  even Eliot, and so on. But I agree  with the punk roots... Push over. When were you in Paris? No, I'm not alright! Your poem brought  my period on a week and half early!  So just shut up. Everybody just shut  up! Yeah, but when were you in Paris? So what about this friend of yours,  Hot Shot? The publisher. Yeah. Angus James. How about sending  this poem to him? When's it gunna be done, Simon? Well, you oughta be home writing  instead of hanging out over here  with all your groupies. Hey, I'm not a groupie. Pardon me, swivel-hips. Is that your  PowerBook? Yeah. Can I see it? What's 'scatalogical' mean? That's what the Board of Education  called Simon's poem, yesterday;  scatological. Hello? Yeah, I'm listening. My name is Edna Rodriguez and I write  the human interest column for the  Queens County Examiner and I was  just wondering if I could have a  word with Simon Grim? Simon! Thank you. You can't talk to him for, you know,  too long or anything, 'cause he's  gotta, you know... he writes all  day. That's all he does. Can you  believe that? Hey! Simon! Get down here! Simon, this is Edna. She's from the  newspaper. Simon, the Parents' Association at  the local high school are calling  your poem pornography. The teachers  are defending the students' right to  exercise their critical tastes and  sensibilities. The county agrees  with the Church and considers the  poem emblematic of modern society's  moral disintegration. How do you  feel about these controversial  reactions to your poem? Simon, answer the woman. I need my prescription filled. Mom, this is Edna. Edna, Mom. Mrs Grim, what was Simon like as a  child? We all thought he was retarded. Everyone did. Never said a word. He masturbated constantly. Had no friends. Till he met Henry. And that's when all the trouble really  started. Simon, wake up! The guy's in a dream  world! His reputation as what? Gimme a break. If he's such a great big fat genius,  why doesn't he write books? Like you  do. Yeah, I bet. It's probably disgusting. Have you read it? Yeah, well, what ever. Listen, Simon,  forget Henry. Go straight up to this  Angus James character yourself and  make him read your poem. I'm gunna apply for a job at the one- hour photo joint and then go over to  the Mall to see about that job in  the bank. Make sure Mom takes her  pills. See ya. Yes, it was nice. But it was  unremarkable. Yes. It does. Simon? Hi, I'll take that. Aren't you the messenger? Are you here to fix the plumbing? Are you? I'm sorry to disturb you, gentlemen,  but... Angus, there's a particularly  wound-up young garbage man out here  who seems to have written a poem. A  long poem. And I recall how, at last  month's meeting, you stressed the  need for us to be on the look-out  for more marginalized verse from  unestablished quarters of the American  scene. Right-e-o. Because he's a very important man  and, well, you're not. Be reasonable. Sorry to disturb you again, gentlemen,  but... Angus, I'd like to call  security for this one. Though, before  I do, I just wanted to ask just how  marginal the as yet undiscovered  voice of American poetry should be? He's been denounced by his local  Board of Education. He's adorable. Just say 'Yes'. Have a seat, Mr Grim. What about Steve? How do you spell that? Ontologically. Never mind. You feel the same way. I can tell. I  can see it when you look at me. Yes you do. In the street. In the  parking lot yesterday. That night on  the highway. You think I'm stupid. You do? I remember Henry. He used to be the janitor here. Anybody home? Mom? Ma, that you? Hey, Henry, you in there? Gimme a  cigarette. Henry? Henry? What kind of... Well, I mean... What  kind of... perverse things would you  do to me? No, really. He's a good man, Henry. Nobody's  perfect. He's terribly disappointed. Thanks. She gets scared. I love him. Go away. Is there something you want? Yeah. So what? I don't wanna talk about it, Henry! What? No. Because. I don't know if he would want us to  do that. I don't know. Henry... He came by this afternoon. No. He thinks I'm a slut. Jesus, Henry! Hey, Henry. You OK? Oh. Oh, Henry. Simon, do something. Look. It's all over the Internet. They're even talking about it on the  TV news. Simon? There's a guy from the radio station  over at World of Donuts and a story  in the newspaper about some kids  burning down a school near Boston! God, Simon, I mean, like, you're a  total fucking rock star. It's really that bad? Play! Henry, what did I tell you about  bringing the kid in here! How you doin', sweetie? You wanna  Coke? Ned! Ned! Henry! Listen, you degenerate, I've had  about enough of this! Ned, have you been drinking? Henry, don't come home tonight! I'm  warning you! Don't come home at all!  Ever! You want some? Come sit here. That's what my dad always says. 'You want some?' People say you were once in jail for  having sex with a girl my age. You want some? I was here first. You go home. Wait! I can't go home. He beat her up again. Do you think I'm pretty? I'll suck your cock if you kill him  for me. What do you think you're doing, you  idiot! Mind your own business, Henry. Yes. It is. That was... I dunno. Fifteen...  Sixteen years ago. We were married seven years ago. Pardon me? I didn't know that. No. Yeah. I don't know, honey. Leave me alone  a minute, I gotta think. What! Yes, Ned, he is. He's in big trouble.  Now just be quiet for two minutes. I'm warning you, Ned. Sure you can, honey. You can be  anything you want. Promise me you'll be on that plane  at seven, Simon. Yeah, well, tough.
