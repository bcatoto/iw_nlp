Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been a year since my last confession... I've never told anyone this. Not my mom, not the poice, not even my friends -- except for the ones who were there and they...well they're not around anymore. You see I...I... I killed a man. Well, I thought I had...then... You've got to understand...It was all an accident. A terrible accident. It's been a whole year. I've tried to get past this, but I just can't. I have these dreams...horrible dreams. And this man is always there with me. You see, he was a killer. He murdered Helen and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if I hadn't...gotten away with it. I don't know, I guess I just need to deal with the fear, the guilt...to finally say his name. Ben Willis. His name was Ben Willis... You know? But how could you... I'm sorry -- I'm fine. I'm fine. I had another dream, Will. It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me. I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months. It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school. It was one year ago... I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place. Right. Now I remember. Are you getting out of town on the fourth? I'm okay. Thanks for the talk, Will. You're good to me. Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me. Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him. Ray, we're just friend. Why are you being like this? Ray, I can't... I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand... It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be. It just isn't. Hey, why don't you stay up here? They have fireworks over the river. And...there's a million things to do. Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while. Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm just scared...that's all. Okay. Okay. Face your fears... There's nothing... Quiet. I thought you were out of town! What are you doing in my closet? I thought you were out of town! What are you doing in my closet? i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them! That was heart attack time, Karla. No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time. And we're going to put away the utensils and you're coming with me. I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed. Yeah, right -- whatever. I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings. Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street. There's nothing between Will and me. Yet. Nothing yet. What we gotta do is keep moving. No time to mope. I'm working at the club tonight. And you, dancing queen, are coming with me.  No I'm not. Fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed. I don't think so. It's pretty crowded. If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it. Ask her to dance. Go on. Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature. Say yes. No. No means yes. Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers -- Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance. Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here? Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway. What? Ben... That could break the machine. Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact. It's Tyrell. The number's unlisted... Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt. Okay, okay. You're right. I know it, and it feels good. Hi, Ty. Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson. Jules, it's Mark in the Morning. Well, I'm in school and -- Yes! Brazil? Um... You don't know?! You have to know. You know everything... ...South America...Carnival... Still here...thinking... You mean Brazil, the country? Rio de Janeiro! No. Yes? Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh! Magic 96.7! I won. I won...I won, I won, I won. Now, let's see...There's Tyrell, that's one. And, there's my parents ...And I got some cousins. Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark said four tickets. That means you gotta get yourself a date. Hi. No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one -- It's okay. Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her. We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and... You know... It's not you, it's Southport. And it's the Bahamas! And it's free! You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas? Ray, come on. I want us to be together. Will you try...for me, please? Ray...please try. I really miss you. Okay. Bye. That boy has got fish on the brain. Hey, cheer up, Charlie. We're going to the Bahamas. Bahama Mama, yeah... Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire. He's not coming. I thought he was just... Julie, you left four messages... Four. But, he said he'd try. He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing! He does work hard. Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can. And I don't want to have to say I told you so... Then, don't. Oh! Hey, sorry... He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste. I said we start having fun. And that means now. Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on. You know what? This rocks. We're going to the Bahamas! We goin' Bahamas, I'm Ty's Bahama Mama. We goin' Bahamas... Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood. Deep breaths -- You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning. Honey, some folks just can't fly. I'm the King of the World. No, I'm the King of the World. Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years. I will, and you remind me of the same thing. It's pretty remote here. Check it out. Take a bath, maybe. Hello? Hello? Where is everyone? I'll ask -- Checking in...Karla Wilson. It sure is a beautiful old hotel. Oh, what? Is that bad? Your what? We haven't exchanged anything. Julie, we're talkin' suites! That'll be just fine with us. Wait...Did you say off-season? Storm season? Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true. I wanted you all to have a good trip. It beets being on the mainland. Oooh, the mainland -- Why's that? We won a competition. Rio, baby! Their stuff in there... ...and ours in here. Karla! You promised. I also promised Tyrell. Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore. That's your number twelve -- Get me some help down here. We got a flatline, room twelve. You guys lost? Wanna drink? How about some ID? Kidding. Didn't anyone tell you this is -- That's none of your business. Not anymore. No. I shot him. What you want is a Dark and Stormy: Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch of Tabasco. Sailors drink it for luck in the hurricane season, trust me. Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute -- He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... But... I miss Ray...I tried to call him. Ray made up his own mind...so, you're free to make up yours. For the next foury-eight hours... Your smile is a frown...turned upside down. They all start to look the same once you've worked in one. Am I right, sister? I'm Julie. This is Karla. Nancy. Welcome to Tower Bay's most happenin' hotspot. Four Dark and Stormies... To a great weekend -- I'll drink to that! So what do you do around here for fun? Make fun of tourists mainly. Or let them make fun of themselves... Karaoke -- perfect. Don't even think about it. Okay, I won't. Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is for somebody who really needs it. Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese! Everyone thinks their a singer. No way. Yes. No. Yes. Not me...no way... Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James. You asked for it. Song number thirty-nine. First I was afraid...I was petrified... I will survive...I will survive... It's...him. He did something to the screen...it, it, said... Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry... Julie... There's no way...just stop it right now... Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic. Oh, Will! I'm sorry. No, no, no. This was really sweet... No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry. Are you sure? I really appreciate it. Tha's it. I've decided. I'm changing my major to finance. And going to Wall Street. 'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this. Jacuzzi. I spent a hundred bucks on it...even if it's just so you can pull it off. You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie? Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet. Don't you get feisty... I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle. Ty! How's Julie? Your not out yet, slugger. You gotta just get back up there and keep swingin'. Will...? Will? Is that you? It's happening again! There's a body! It's in my room! There was a body! I swear it! I wasn't dreaming. Listen to me. He's here. What's going on? Cool. I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there. Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see? The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there. Don't look at me -- I want off this island. Then I'll call the mainland for a charter. It's dead. What about a radio? What the hell would you call this? Housekeeping. Housekeeping. You get any sleep at all? Some. Hey -- It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too. Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress? Nice move. I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it. Come on, Vampira. I got just the thing for you. Cancer in a box. No, this is the safe sun. It's better than a day at the beach. Come on, a little photosynthesis and you'll feel like a new -- Houseplant. Exactly. Karla! Just kidding. Gee, Karla...That'll break the machine... Damn. How many pairs you got in there? You say something? Karla! Somebody? Hey, this isn't funny. Julie! Oh, God, get me out. Get me out. I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here... We've got to get to the radio and call for help. I think we can classify this as an emergency situation. We gotta get out of here. Now. There were boats here? Refresh my memory, there were boats... We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one. Ben Willis. Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here. They never found the body. Two summers ago. We lied to the authorities. We hit Ben Willis with our car. Ray, me, Barry, and Helen ...We threw the body in the water to cover it up -- Julie... Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth. I thought Ray and I killed him on the boat, but we didn't and now he's back to finish up the job. Julie, we have to do something. It's not him. Voodoo. Julie, where are you going? Leave him alone. Let him go. I believe him. Come on, Julie. You saw his room. He's telling the truth. He could've easily killed me. He didn't. Look, we didn't even answer the radio question right...This whole thing was a setup. What do you mean? Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose. I don't know. How do we know you're not? I know I don't want to stay in here. We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good. Did he do it? Be careful, Julie. I've got to see. ...Today's July fourth. I'm not dying on this island, Will. Do you hear me? You want me, Ben Willis? Come and get me. I'm right here. My grave stays empty! Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place. Then, we fight -- Why? He can't help us. Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own. Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree? I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood. Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else. It's too late for that. I'm so sorry. I brought this on everyone. It's my fault. You think that's a good place to hide? Ty! Wait, it's Nancy -- I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this -- You stumbled into my hiding place. Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up. I've never seen a dead body before. Get used to it. Who's doing this? I know where we can hide. Give me a boost up -- There's no way to lock it. What do we do? There's no way to grip this thing. Watch your step... You sick freak. Oh, god, no -- Karla! Oww... It's locked! It's gotta be one of these. He's inside. Please! Hurry! Come on... Hurry! Nancy... It's jammed! Come on!! No way!! Move! Come on, gimme a shot -- Julie, come on. It's over there. I don't know... Come on, you can make it. There's a light somewhere. Julie? I'm right here. Grab my hand. This place has emergency power. Just ease you way down the stairs and I'll find the light. Okay. I'm at the bottom. Karla, just get my hand. I'm holding your hand! No, you're not. ...Nancy? All right -- Help's here. Help's here. Did you get help? What happened? He's in it with Willis? Your stomach, you're hurt -- Oh, my god, you're bleeding to death. We need a first-aid kit. I saw one in the lobby. I'll come with you. Will, just hold on. We'll get you fixed up. Look up there. I'll look over here. You've got blood everywhere, but I can't find the wound. Help me. Come on, come on. Why are you doing this to me? I trusted you. ...Why? OMIGOD -- No, no, no -- Just...Die. Oh, god, it's you -- You're okay. Thank god. Is he? You know, it's true what they say about package vacations...You get what you pay for. Now, how about we get off this piece of crap island. We don't have to tell anyone it rained the whole time. It can just be our little secret. Ray...what are you doing? Never do that again. I love it here. You know me to well. What is my problem?
