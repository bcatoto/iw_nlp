Sebastian, do you know what time it  is? What is it this time? Not your business. Not anymore. So you calling about anything in  particular, or were you just hoping to  catch me sleeping in the nude? You cracked it? You sure? Eleven months with no progress and you  suddenly come up with it out of the  blue? How? I hate you. Yeah, I think I can find him. What are  you going to do? Hey... come on. Sebastian just called. We gotta get to  the lab. Give me some credit, will ya. He cracked reversion. We better take our own cars. I know. It s just You re his best  friend. He ll feel betrayed. Morning, sir. Your team s in early. Something  special going on? Have a good day, sir. You okay? Yeah. She s become a lot more  aggressive in the last few days. Go take care of that bite. I ll get  her. Knock it off. Isabelle! What s that make it? But I m catching up. Can I have a word? Don t you think you should test the  protocol on the liver samples before  you inject Isabelle? That s beside the point. Fine. You can mop up afterward. Kill? More like liquefy. Yes, Sir. You said you wanted the beat vet in  the country. Maybe that s why she s so good. Normal. Okay. We are rolling record on videos  one through twelve. Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting  serial protein Caine One Two Five. Propped. Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. Elevated heartbeat. We re still in the green. It s working. It s actually working. Heart rate s up. She s scared. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Subject may be in pain or extreme  discomfort. Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating.  Brain activity going through the roof.  We ve got a problem. It s her heart. We can see the heart  beating in the ape s She s going into cardiac arrest. Got the crash cart. We re losing her. Clear! We ve got something! Still. erratic. Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do  it. You can fucking do it. Come on, monkey. Stabilizing. Welcome back, Isabelle. I think she s gonna be okay Screw you, Matt. We should celebrate. I thought you'd gone. A little "I am become death... the  shatterer of worlds"? Since the day I met, all you wanted to  do was change the world. Listen, I know we've... I mean... well  ... I just want you to know how proud  I am of you. I know it probably  doesn't mean a lot... You're positively maudlin. You should  be happy. Do you have any idea what  you've accomplished? Nothing. It's just... He is who he is.  Sometimes I just have to be reminded. I'm sure he had a reason. You did have a reason, didn't you,  Sebastian? It's their money, Sebastian. It's  going to happen eventually. Isn't it a little soon to be moving  into phase three anyway? She's right. We haven't even finished  collating the phase two research. You don't even know if any of the  protocols will work on humans. Sebastian ... humans can talk, build  houses and cook in microwave ovens.  Gorilla's live in trees. That's a  helluva 2% if you ask me. Why you? Why not one of us? What if you're too valuable to lose? In the past six years, I've never once  challenged your decisions, but this  ... Sebastian. I don't think you  should do this. Oh please. How long were we together?  You must've said it a million times  ... Nobody knows who built the lunar  lander. All they remember in the first  man on the moon. But what if something happens to  you... what about the project? He refuses to listen to reason. Sorry. I just can't let it go. So how can we let him do this? In a heartbeat. Let me ask another question. Is the human race really ready for  what we're doing? No really. Is it ready? We're  barrelling down a road that begs moral  and ethical questions that I don't  think we can answer. This night is still young. I mean, when you think about it, it's  creepy. Do we really want to live in a  world where people can just disappear  in the blink of an eye? O.K. How're you feeling? Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit  elevated. No reason for concern. He's ready. Start recording. We're hot. All systems nominal,  Houston. Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs. We can still shut down, Sebastian. Injection was administered at Vitals are stable. Nothing's happening. Maybe we overlooked something. Frank? Here we go. Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 100. What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP Pulse is 165 ... 170 Blood pressure  180 over 100. ... Prop the crash cart. We can't! Something's happening. I didn't think the human brain could  spike that high. Pulse is 180 .... holding stable. Pulse is dropping. 170.. Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at No. He passed out from the trauma. Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110  ... dropping. Blood pressure 130 over Pulse steady at 70. You did it, Sebastian. You're the  first. His breathing's hypnotic. How long's  it been? Where are the others? I keep looking at that hole, wondering  if he's really there. Did you see... Your eyelids are transparent. Yes. Your arms ... your whole body... It  worked, Sebastian. It worked. Your system received quite a shock. Sebastian. Sebastian? Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea,  headache, body-ache, disorientation. Why don't you ask him? Sebastian, how do you feel. He can't close his eyes so they're  sensitive to light. So, what was it like? C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off. Index Mark. 112125. It's late. Time you got some rest. Hate to pull rank, but you're my  patient now and you need rest. We've  got a busy day tomorrow. We've set up a thermal camera for  observation and I've arranged one of  us to be here 24/7 in case you need  anything. The team's gonna be on alpha- call alert for the duration. If  anything goes wrong, we can all be  here within... I was trying to be reassuring. What's that? Please. I'm just doing my job. You gonna be okay? Fine. It's not like I have anything  else going on in my sad pathetic life. Carter'll be in at six to spell you  and I'll be in by nine. Call me if  anything happens, okay? I'm fine. Go on ahead. Days only get longer from here. Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are  you in here? Dr. Caine? Dr. Caine, please report in. Dr. Caine, report in please! Shit.  Dr. Caine? Sebastian? Come on, this  isn't funny. I know you're in here.  I must be going crazy. I found him later in the lab, running  samples. Why didn't you call me? Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not.  I mean, I could've easily been  dreaming. God, I feel so stupid. I can talk to him. No. I mean... It was probably nothing. I  shouldn't've mentioned it. Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why  would he do that, right? Just, this  place at night can be kinda creepy,  y'know. Yeah. Why? No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This  might hurt a bit. Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid,  but are you... are you looking at me. Just felt like someone was staring at  me. Sebastian? Goddamnit. That's what worries me.? What happens when we turn the project  over to the Army. Ever wonder how much  fun they're gonna have? Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny. Grow up. Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow. Recording? De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial  Protein Caine One Two Seven. Ready? Tough. Heartbeat elevated. What's wrong? He's not breathing. Pulse erratic. Carter! Sebastian! Sebastian! Sebastian! He's reverting. Got him on the table.  Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven. I got no pulse. No pulse. Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you  hear me? How are his pupils? I think he's going into shock. Guess so. I was just thinking about the Apollo  missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and  Chaffee... What it was like for them  on that launch pad that day, thinking  they were gonna reach the stars only  to burn to death. But he didn't die, did he? What if we can't bring him back? What  then? No. I want to be here for him. Hey... You almost died. I should be making you feel better.  Not vice versa. You could almost pass for human. Could be the barium or the radiation. Do you want me to stay? Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile? You got that right, sir. I was  beginning to worry 'cause your car  hadn't moved. I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna  swing by his place, just in case. I don't want him to see. Sebastian? Sebastian? Oh shit. Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No.  He's taken his make-up off. I don't  know...He must be outside somewhere. I don't know where he went. I'm coming  back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed  to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM!  We're going on alpha call.  I want  everyone at the lab now. We're gonna  need thermal visors and we may need  tranqs. What are the tranqs for? Use your imagination. Are you saying he's dangerous? The Metro stops running after midnight  and he's on foot, so he can't have  gotten too far. This program is classified. If he's  out there it means someone might find  out about him. He could destroy the  whole program. Bullshit! I went to your apartment and  I happen to know you did a helluva lot  more than pick some stuff up. You, of all people How could you?  You put yourself and this project at  risk. I saw your face and your clothes. That's not good enough. When you're  outside the lab there are a thousand  variables none of us can control. It's  just not safe for you to be out there. You volunteered for this, Sebastian.  You knew going in there could be  consequences. For the security of this project, I'm  gonna have to ask you to confine  yourself to the compound. You're right. It's your decision. But  if you leave the compound again, I'll  notify the oversight committee. Then  they can make the decision. You  understand? Pack 'em up... Everyone go home. Hold still. Not enough to worry about. What are you talking about? I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when  a classified experiment disappears in  the middle of the night, someone's  gotta run the show. Look, I know how hard this has been  for you. Now it's a gift? Where're you going? Want to talk about it? "We are the hollow men, the stuffed  men, headpieces filled with straw." I don't want to fight you. I just want  what's best for the program. You can be scared. That's okay. You're talking like you've given up.  It's only been a few months. That's all we need. I don't blame him. I'll go talk to him. Good morning. I restructured the third genome on  your radiated protein strand. Thought  you might want to take look. I thought you'd want to take a look at  it. I'm telling you, I know him.  Something's going on. If he knew about us, he'd be angry and  that wasn't angry. It's fine. I just didn't know you were  there. Goodnight. What was it? Thanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye. Phew. You awake? Notice anything unusual last night. Franklin Three. He's dead. His neck was broken and his windpipe  collapsed. I thought maybe you could tell me. He was alive last night when I left  and he was dead this morning. And you  were the only one down here. He never left the room. A windpipe doesn't just suddenly  collapse. Someone or something killed  it. Then we have a problem, because I the  cage was locked from the outside. That  means it was opened, the dog was  killed and the cage was closed and  locked again. Only a human could do  that. Are we sure? Quiet night at home. Maybe a book. He's still in the picture. Why? Maybe someday I will. See you in the  morning. Forgot something. Asshole. And you think he's violent? He killed a dog with his bare hands. Either way, we aren't equipped to  handle this. We have to inform the  committee. What if he doesn't come back? They'll go after him. Who has tonight's shift? I do. Pretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just  do what you're doing so he doesn't  become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll  go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot  the committee deal with it. Thank you, sir. What was that about? You coming up? Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry. When did he say held call? I'm gonna call him. Yes, Dr. Kramer please. Excuse me? When? I'm so sorry. He's dead. Drowned in his pool last  night. Yes, General Thompson please. Thank  you.  Hello? Hello? I'll be right back with help. Foster One Delta Eight Three Five. That's a first. Foster One Delta Eight Three Five. Tell me this isn't happening. We've got a problem. There's no set check in procedure. It  could be weeks. You think you can got in? Some security system. Whose? Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us  where you are. Sebastian... where are you? C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me.  Tell me where you are and we can talk  about it. Sebastian! Sebastian! I want search parties. Thermal goggles  and tranquilizers. Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine? Sebastian? There's something over there. She was strangled. Multiple blows to  her head. We got a big problem here. Get everybody to the conference room.  Now! Gimme that. It was just working. Shhh. Give me the visor. C'mon. Janice is dead. It's clear. The man has checked out of reality. He wasn't. He is now. No. We find him, before he finds us. We designed it to help find the rats  we kept dropping in year one. They  were too small for thermal scans. I've got movement in Corridor Six. Check. Check. Be careful. Take a right at the next accessway.  He's working his way back to the  offices. If he keeps heading in that direction. I lost him. Matt, I lost him. He was there. I got movement again! He's right on  top of you! Right on top of you. What's going on? Are you okay? Matt, he's coming toward you. Got outta there. He's close! He's coming right at you! Twenty, maybe thirty feet. Those signatures ... they're coming  from the heating vents. Get out of there! I'm going! That's why I'm going. Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to  the lab. We'll meet you there. Do it. This way. Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow. It's pretty severe. We have to get him  to the lab. For godsakes, help me. I know. He's gone. Habitats. His pulse is faint. He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold  this. Keep applying pressure. Don't move your hand until I got back. This'll hold him but he needs blood. Supply is right down the hall. I'll be  two seconds. If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on  the wound. He's let the animals out. It wasn't  him we were tracking. You okay? Me .... Don't ask about me. If he  freed all the animals, we could have  dozens running around the lab. Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors  and pray to God Frank can reprogram  the elevator. Frank? Who's there? Dr. Caine? Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me  go.  What are you doing? No! Help me! Oh God. Somebody help me! Where is she? I said no one goes anywhere alone. He's dead. Oh god. Sarah! No... This didn't happen. This hasn't  happened. He's here! Sebastian! Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me. I don't know if you can understand  this, but what you're experiencing is  a psychological breakdown. This isn't  who you are. You goddamn bastard! You goddamn  bastard. You're gonna pay for this.  I'm going to bring you back to  visibility and then I'm going throw  your ass in jail. Fuck you! Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man  than you'll ever be. Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No... Matt! Frank!  Matt! Matt! Frank! Jesus! No! Hang on! You won't get away with this. They'll  find out about you. They'll hunt you  down. How can you be so brutal? Just keep going. I'll fix you later. Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now. Shhh. Don't talk. We gotta move. Hang on. You feel that? Your losing blood, but he didn't hit  the vitals. Sutures and thread. Goddamnit. This is temporary. You still with me? Just keeps getting worse. Oh shit. There's got to be. Matt! MATT! We're not dying in here. Sebastian! I can't let you leave. Come on out and  I'll give you one last chance. Aaaaaaahhhh! You wanna see God? I'll show you God. Nitro... He's rigged the centrifuge. Grab on. Fuck you. Give me your hands. Climb! Climb! Keep moving. Oh God! Move! C'mon. Before it slips. It's him. Get off me. Let go of me. Go to hell. What happened? We lived.
