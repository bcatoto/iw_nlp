Somethin' went wrong, huh? Like I just ran, or something.... Feel one lung short. All of us. Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking grateful. This beast wasn't made to land like this. But cripes, you rode it down. C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason we're alive is a'cuzza her. Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse? Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me. We're worried you'll scare us. Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're goin' to Taurus Three like we were? Yeah, but...do we even have enough food to get there? Or will we have to resort to cannibalism? A'course we will. My bloody oath.... Three suns? He'd probably get you right here, right under the jaw. And you'd never hear him coming. That's how good Riddick is. Okay, it was me. What'd I do now? What're you goin' on about? She's been right here for the last.... Zeke? No! It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just.... What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke? If you're afraid, I'll go. Did you find him? You find Zeke? Oh, right. Let's all line up and beg his forgiveness. Right you are. So I can talk to him now? Not a star-jumper. Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get it up and chuggin'. Talkin' to me? Looks like geologists. Advance team, moves around from rock to rock. But why did they leave their ship? Sure. Coulda had a real drop-ship take them off-planet. Long gone. Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know. Why was the door chained up? Why the bloody hell would they lock themselves in like that? So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you saw it. You was right there. You were tryin' to kill him too. Take it. Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it. Yeah? What's special about that? If we need anything from the crash ship -- I suggest we kick on. That sand-cat's solar. We stay together! C'mon! Lookit. Lookit! Tell her to stay there. Stay down. What if...what if she's still out there... still alive.... Why do they do that? Make that sound? Maybe it's just their beads again. Imam, are you still -- You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there? Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope? I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything.... What's he talkin' about? What're they doin' up there? What're they doing? What're Gonna lose everybody out here.... Three full bottles. But almost time to refill. What? What is it? Why's he still out there? He's not coming back, is he? Glow worms.... More, more, we need more.... You came for us.... Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started. Where you goin'?
