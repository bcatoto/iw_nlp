I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound. But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji? The memory of who? What's he doing?It's beautiful! What are you waiting for? Well, what do you want to do? If we don't go now, it won't happen. Now. No. No...I, er. I'm sorry. It's not up to me. --I'm not allowed to talk to you. That's right. Lauren. Oh, yes.--Truman, you're gonna be late! Truman, stop it! You're the one talking to the walls! Do something... You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening. I've tasted other cocoas. This is the best. Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink? All natural. Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners-- That's not true. Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well. So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea? I'd better call your mother when we get there. She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this. So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans? Truman, what about that sign? Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath! There's been an accident, Truman. Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own! Truman, that was our house! You blaming me for the traffic? Truman, I think I'm going to throw up. So why do you want to go? You hate gambling. What?! You're upset because you want to go to Fiji. Is that it? --we need more charcoal. I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday. I thought I'd make my potato salad. Remind me-- Put some butter on it--or ice? I don't know-- Oh, my God! Surgery. The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night. Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors. Non-union contractors. Monsters. We're starting with an amputation. I'm sorry, I'm late. See you in a minute, sweetheart. I'll take you home, Angela. Why don't you leave those with us for a while? Come on, Truman. Haven't you studied enough? I made macaroni. Your mother called. You shouldn't upset her like that. I know. What're you doing down here? This'll pass. Everybody thinks like this now and then. Come to bed. I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure? We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments. Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations? And then what, Truman? We'd be back to where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager. Every time you and Marlon-- Oh, God. Where have you been? Did something happen today? I was hoping we could have a special evening. A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw. We got three of his fingers back on. Hi, honey. Look at this. It's a "Chef's-Mate." Dicer, slicer and peeler in one. Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe. Well, what do you think? It's a surprise. Truman, you're gonna be late!Because his mother got sick - very sick. He couldn't leave her. He's a kind boy, maybe too kind. Shhh! They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory. Things always do--when you look back. Hold on a minute, dear. Here's us at Mount Rushmore. You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive. You slept all the way there. You know he was an only child, like you. I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm. But I don't blame you, Truman. I never have. --Darling-- About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown. We don't want to end up like the rest of the country. It doesn't sound insane, Truman. I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces. I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday. I feel certain my condition runs in the family. Can't this wait, dear? You look very pale, Truman. Are you taking your vitamin D's? You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear. Oh, just so. Well, I made it through another night.Fine. I'll tell her. When you get to Fiji? I'll try. I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.You must listen. Everybody's pretending, Truman. --It doesn't matter. Everybody knows about it. They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared. --And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman. There's nothing left to explore." Just listen. You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan-- They're going to stop me talking to you. They're coming. Any minute.
