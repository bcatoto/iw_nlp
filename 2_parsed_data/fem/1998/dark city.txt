I�ve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompson�s office searched, as I believe you instructed. All clear now, sir. They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man. The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand. I�m your new assistant. Patricia Crenshaw. Sorry, sir.That's easy. You... They're dead, John. Of course you are. You couldn't do those terrible things. Come home with me - maybe things will make sense then... It's the truth... I need you. I know you're innocent.
