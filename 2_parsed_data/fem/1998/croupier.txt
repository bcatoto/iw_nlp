What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone? You're all scumbags. Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now. You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are. Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew. You fucking little shit! You shopped me. Sorry. Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit! Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others. Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it? I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that. Well it is. But I know where I am. Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves. I got scared. But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M. No blow jobs. No screwing. All men are cheats. You're shaking. I'll take you up on that. My car's in the garage. Jack. Do you need a ride? How do I look? Hi, Jack. Welcome to the cesspit. I'm Bella.Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you... Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am. Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months. Jack! It's Jani. It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you. Would you like a drink? I took the bandage off yesterday. Bruise? Oh, yes. It's better. The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats. Do you? Well, life's not fair. We know that. Thank you. Is it yes? I have to take the car. I'm sorry. I told you, all bets are off. Let it go. No, forget it. The bet's off. I want you to forget what I said. I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend. I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean. Next time it'll be my neck. These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you. You keep the ten thousand pounds. It won't. I've come to know you. You're honest. I trust you. You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all. You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen. Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal. The point is, they want a man inside. My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino - They mean it. Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion. I know that. But you can now. I owe a lot of money. I'm in trouble. I didn't. That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before. Which side do you like? You don't like cheats, do you. What happened? He doesn't gamble. That's fine. Just an accident. Nothing. Toss you for it. I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off. I must go. Let me pay for this. Do you believe in astrology? That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there? And the lies. Gamblers are born liars. I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother. Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there. Near the casino. No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership. I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar. To coincidence. That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me? You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink. Well, thank you anyway. You know where I'm from?Where to? Too much. Eighteen hundred. I might. I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on? I'm Lucy. You've been avoiding me.How can anyone be that naive? What? Why did you take the money? You're already alone. Here...use a spoon. Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple. Nothing about you. It's probably easier for you to eat the rice. I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend. I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here. Really? I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time... Aren't you ever tempted to gamble? You were talking in your sleep. You will? It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong. -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I? I hope it brings you luck. No. Answer it! The door, Jack. Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it. Without hope there's no point to anything. Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack. There's no hope in it. I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you? Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and -- I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic. I don't like it. Well, that's our life now, isn't it? I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on. What are you doing here? You know the rules. Haven't you got a conscience of your own? What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me. Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier. This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started. Are you drunk? Take that back! Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more. Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine. When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep. I loved it blond. Poor baby. This'll relax you. You're shaking. What is it? How did it go? What's the time? You've got such beautiful hands. I love you Jack, you know that. You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me. You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers. 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training? How did you land that? What job? I want to hear it. You're my prisoner. Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you. Take it back. Till you sell your book. You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you. Where did you get it? It's not just inner beauty, is it? I won't be that long. No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer. I couldn't resist them.
