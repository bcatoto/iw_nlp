She's dying and Rache is your mother now! So what's up? Who's marrying who this time? Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol... Ben! What's wrong? I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me! I can put myself to bed. I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk. I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie! I'll miss you so much. Yes. Until he's old enough to read. I'm not. I don't want to say goodbye. And bring my knees up, real hard, yeh? You cannot believe what he said, it was the worst instant of my total life on Earth !! Mom? What's wrong? Maybe twenty. This'll work, huh? This is a joke, right? I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame. Not with my mouth open. ...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some really clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings. Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded dorkface little adoring out-crowd henchmen ... Great. A debate. Man's inhumanity to woman. He's pro women. I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted. She is only the Princess of Cool. Mommy is the Queen! He wouldn't know. I saw her in the shower! I said... THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON! Where's Rache? It's Thursday , we get to be with Rache ! You lied. If you lied then , maybe you're lying now . I can never belive you again ! And don't tell her I told you. Actually. She's kind of cool, when you get to know her. She knows every neat junk food place. ...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself. Are you kidding ? It is so much better than the one Rachel showed me! Wow. Who's that for? I'll be there for you. Like how? No I'm not. I don't care. Why should I care? I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced. Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother. Nobody even asked me if I like her. If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh... Or blush. You look pale. But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates... Then why are you putting on mascara? What are you gonna talk about? I like talking about it. At least, to you. Because it feels really incredibly good. Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh... I live. In the same country. During sex. Why does Rachel scream? Sex. Of course. I'll ride ahead. Nelson, protect the Queen... I'm gonna call him. Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now. What happens when he loves Rachel more than us? It just slipped out. Like who? I'm not upset. Why would I be upset? Mass hysteria. I don't want that to happen. Why would I want that to happen? I didn't say that. Why would I say that? I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up. I hate when you say that. I don't care. But Rache... In high school. Uh. What is it? No. But they stand out, a little. Like this. Uh. He thinks his nose is too big. But it's not. Not use my words, please! And Mom says anger never, never solves anything. It makes every- thing worse . No, his mother's always on time. I did what she said. I used my words, I told him what I felt , and they... IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT !! Suits me fine ! You're just a stepmother . So stop bossing , cos nobody's listening ! You think this is funny? That doesn't bother me. Annabelle pick up the phone. Why don't you say hello? Here's weak ...Mom said she was gonna talk to the teacher and Brad's parents !! Can you believe the humiliation ??? You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me now ? In front of the whole world ? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!! I killed my math quiz, A-minus. It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm way too young. It's just for play. MOMMY! Now could she just... forget me! What if he's kidnapped? I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up. But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant! It starts at seven! Just where I wanna be all Saturd... And this is my room so get out! This is my daddy's house -- I don't have to listen to you! You're not my mother. Don't touch me! I'm allergic to you! You swore. You owe me a quarter. Did you remember my egg carton? I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today. I'm gonna beep daddy at work. Never mind. I'll just eat my lunch. No. I told you. I like apple butter not butter butter. You lost Ben?! You forgot to wash my purple shirt. I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today. Cos she loves you. There's worse things. YOU'RE WORSE THAN SHE IS! WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, TOO ? You owe me a quarter. No they're not. Don't take my picture! I hate her. I really hate her. Ice cold water.Good. That's very good. Don't be. I'm going. Where we all go. Now how can that be bad. Are you afraid for me? Where I'm going. Keep Ben's for awhile, okay? Until he's old enough to not open them all at once. Let me be the judge of that. Thank God. I got to see you. Grown up. Don't. Take me with you. No, that never solves anything. You talk like the big girl you are. About what you feel. And how he's hurt you. You know? You tell the truth. I know. I know how rough life can be. And how unfair. So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk straight up to that little jerk... Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem? And I think it's time we move to Plan B... Nothing sweetheart. Annabelle...wake up honey... How many devilled eggs can you eat? Oh, yeh. He's not even there. You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys. You have to ignore him. And what do you do wh... Good girl. You wouldn't kiss him, huh? You don't like his friends. Actually. I could only help him. I could help with the debate. What's Thursd... She is but an arriviste. And...? ...I'm not deaf, y'know. I can't hear you. We make mistakes. And we forgive each other. Because we love each other, very m... I know how scared I get when you're sick. So I waited to tell you. Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr... Secret's safe with me. I bet. Like a big sister. I hope it's the right kind. Well. It's for you. That happens. To families. Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us. But we do have a choice. To make it better. Instead of worse. Daddy and I tried hard. We really did. Look she's upset -- Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara... I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up. Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual... Because it's quiet. And he wants to talk. Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime... So why are you asking me? ...why do you think? How would you know sh... Scream. Well, not exactly s... Daddy was washing Rachel. In the shower. What did you think that was about? Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops. I fear for the women and the property values. Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always. You can call him after dinner but... That will never happen. It happens. Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty. Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face. You wind up looking like... Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in. Well you're telling your teachers and your friends -- Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen. Excellent point. Thank you. Those were all words. I hate the planet Uranus. Terrible name for a planet. Never say 'never' -- it's not fair to say 'always' -- and no name calling. Use your words. I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you are in the purple family. ...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple. No, it isn't. Because it isn't everything. And we want every- thing, don't we? Always. Always. And you won't hear a voice. But in here . You'll know. What I'm saying. Right here. Right here. Inside the magician. Shhhh. The world. Thinks I'm gone. But only the magician. Knows better. Half. Of him. If a soldier loses his legs in a war. Is he the same guy? Sure he is. So what do you think we're gonna talk about? Well, don't make him disappear before I see him. Find the bird cage? I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie. And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar... Okay. These are good. Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day. Ben. God doesn't like visitors. Ben where do you have to get to? Where Ben? Ben! Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing! Ben listen to me... Sugar. I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born. In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight... I'm still sick, but I'm better. Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds. Hers was very bad. I have cancer. Do you know what that is? Mommy's sick, guys. Pray. We never find out. ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD SUFFOCATE IN THERE!!! Thursday's fine... I'm fine, ba... That I do. Always will. Do me a favor? Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay? Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup. Of course, you do. Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food. So, all the more meatballs for you. But you know what. I'm somewhere, thinking of you. And meatballs. And you know what? Not a lot, sweetie. It's a country. Like Canada. Only smaller. You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden. Honey, this is Thursday. I pick you up tomorrow, and we do big spaghetti. What honey? Yes...if you like big hair... People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money. Ben, mommies work too. They work very hard. Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working. I just don't get paid. No, that's your fault. It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority. Which means, the most important job. Ben! Oh my Ben! Are you alright? Thank you Ben. Annabelle! Seven of clubs. Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it. Lava's hateable. I never thought of that. I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together. Hate . I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches? Why would his worry? Or my children's worry. Or anyone's worry. Help the sit... I have to get dressed. My ex-husband has asked me to dinner. God knows why, he was very mysteri... That's necessary, huh? So we'll...radiate some more? People beat it, don't they? All the time. I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller. I live or I die. Walk in the park. And thanks for the 'we'. I know. I wouldn't know what to say. If it were you. Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him? Boy, kids go wild for that. Never stand between that kid and a meatball. It's temporary. Stop. You're making me insecure. And we all went through that together? The great thing about life is that things keep changing. No. You think this is going to help the kids then you do it. You're on your own. WE are over. You can't be an 'us' just when you want to. You can't play that card when it's convenient. To make it easier for them or you? Just not to me. Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago? The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting. Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it. And I'm supposed to care. Slugs . Have faster learning curves. Trees , even. You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war. But I'm doing this for their well-being. Called him. We set an ap... We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke? I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one. I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement. I'm seeing a lawyer. Not to me. Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today? How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did? He could have been... ...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her? At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know. I said I'd get 'em back tonight... Just outside the big top, we're almo... Easy enough. Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend... ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I'm worried. You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes... It's Wednesday night. She's at my house. I'll talk to her. Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up -- They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father. We're not discussing your age. Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age -- Something's up wi... Because you don't really seem here. Are you here? Remarried. There is no move. Just sit me up. Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first. Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes. I have their past. You'll learn. You're the hip and fresh. What do I have that you don't? Why didn't I? He only remembers I found him. My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you. I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off. Doing my imitation of you. I lost him. I was panicked. Come on, a wuss like me? The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back? Is scary. But you want it. Gimme some truth here. No, there isn't. What's this about? Because we fought ? She likes a Stolie, no ice. Thanks for coming out. You've turned her into you. And I may not get another chance. To turn her back. And there will come another moment. When the stakes are really there. And she will look back on this. And remember how good it felt. How easy it was. Well, that's what parenting is about , little girl. They are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell showed her. Doing the right thing. Knowing who you are , inside. Not caving to peer pressure, or lowering yourself to that level, steering your own course... Shut the fuck up. I didn't go behind your back. See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity. For some real growth. Well, maybe your version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'. You think I didn't have some dirty words for that little putz? You think I couldn't figure out some low blows? You taught my child that I am some limp dick loser . Who didn't care about her pain. So you became the hero. And I became the schmuck. You had her lie about that... that fancy-boy model ! You put filth in my child's mouth. You are defending what you did? Actually. They'll want Annabelle's mother. Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so. And they'll b... Now, 'limp dick', I know. What. Is 'snowballing'? And I'm going to win. Now we're going to have a fight, you and I. He looks familiar. Did he do a Calvin Klein ad? Who in the world is he? Is that what he told you? Took 28 hours. She just wasn't sure about entering this world. Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that. He loves to hear that story, over and over. How he was born a magician. Feeling the pressure? That's motherhood. That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They need you to be happy. I know you, huh? The car pools, he measles, the PTA. It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run. You have to think long term. Yes. I made the choice that was right for me. And I don't regret it. But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible. And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough. Juggle it! Move the darkroom into your house. You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway. Don't lose your confidence. Don't lose your edge. You mean, after I'm dead? Do what you've worked your whole life to do? I'm thinking. Do I know you well enough to really chew you out? ...go to the park. In the worst way. It's covered , okay? I appreciate your concern. Can I talk to her? Thanks, but it's under control. How's she doing with Brad? Eat your heart out. Is Annabelle there? What else? Keep on keepin' on. He's relentless. A major asshole. The primo stuff is great for pain. You try to center on the big issues, y'know. What it's all about. What this whole trip has meant. But then, the really big issues keep swamping y... Yeh, that's bull. I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there. I really look like shit. It's promising, this one. We're upbeat. It's a mess, right now. That's my project when I get back. And you said...? She's devastated. Oh, my God. ...going out, yeh. I had kids of my own, once. Moi? She hasn't mentioned this. You're a cross-dresser. Small world. Ironic, huh? I have given them more love and more care every fifteen minutes of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty years ! They came out of my body ! You are marrying the greatest guy who walks this earth . Who I have loved from my heart for twelve years ! How would you know anything ? How the hell would you know? Life's a trade-off. You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you do get to smoke dope. Really. By what right? Six months of part-time screw-ups? Then let him talks to me. We don't need you to solve our prob... Did I hear the word... Bi-coastal parenting. Happens every day. Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and... Nobody likes a snoop. Don't flatter yourself. You WHAT? My boss. I don't know wh... Let's...hold up for a bit. It may not happen. Our secret, okay? ...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight. ...thinking of going back to Random House. On a part-time basis. Not great. Plus, I've got things on my mind. You know. Yes? She was angry at herself. Anxiety. Hey. At least it's not an editing machine. It's okay, it's twenty minutes. The horse'll be there. Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish? Ben likes to be read to. Do you know Dr. Seuss...? Bandaids for cuts. Bandaids for new shoe blisters. Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex. Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms... Fine, forget it. However many. It's not enough. I have an appointment this after- noon. I need someone to take them to the park. So why did y... Those are my children you're practicing on. They deserve first- rate care. Every minute. Of every night. And every day. You're not terribly good at taking care of h... I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite... I'm sorry. Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but... A court order is gonna say that woman is never alone with my children! Ever again ! Do you HEAR that? I am not here to make it easier for you. These are my children. They don't want to be with you. You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once. That woman has nothing more to do with my children. Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now. Think twice. Before you ever pull that again. Of all the cheap excuses. To break a child's heart. Machines do not EAT message. You got to hell! Get out! Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother. You mean for you. A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family. She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen? This isn't going to work out. Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards? I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers. ...a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item, which her father and I have already told her she is far too young to own. But you apparently want to buy her forgiveness, with... What did you do? What happened with Annabelle? Has nothing I said gotten through to you? Annabelle, how's your video rep... We don't have any coffee. Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday. It's not that hard. Didn't you have a mother? How do you hold down a job? It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.A suitable boy, will be at this flagpole, on Monday, with a very expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an escort service! The guy I see is in the eighth grade at Prep School, and he laughs his ass off every time we talk about you. He'll be impressed. The clincher is, you walk away, then whip around... Oh. It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to. But it's real. Does he have an older brother? Great. Big ears, too? Help me here... No, baby. You're gonna use my words. And you don't tell her. What you're going to say. That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be. Now, just this once... Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking heart out! ...laughed, yeh. They laughed real hard. Oh, baby, I'm so sor... June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad. And then I will be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th... No. I think it's ugly. You think this is funny? That doesn't bother me. Annabelle pick up the phone. Annabelle, I know you miss your mother. So why don't you say hello. Honey, she won't d... That's so weak. She still packing for her trip? See, I... Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency? And she called me. And we switched days. Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and... C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom... He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN? GODDAMMIT! Lunch time Sleeping Beauty. Where's Ben? Is he in the bathroom? It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon. Hold lunch! The timing was off -- I need this light. This is my house too! What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom. You don't need another one. But when you're at this house -- Thank God for that! I'm sorry, okay? Let's not fi... Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything. He's badgering a witness. Eat. I'm almost done making it. Alright Ben -- you deal with the tardy, you write yourself a note, your daddy told you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH! Here. Of course not. Does he look lost to you? BENNNNN!!! I didn't forget. I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else. Orange Red. That's your color. Few can carry it off. Now please. Help me find your brother. IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP. 'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man... Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad... How could I be? We learned some magic... That's nice Ben. &quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot; &quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben! Mmmm! Tasty. You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad. &quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot; Thank you Ben. That was so sweet of you. Goodnight Annabelle. Sweet dreams. Annabelle let's get something clear. ...EGGzactly. I'm putting on my coat -- We are late. We are seriously late. Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed -- Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door... Ben! Knock it off! It's gonna go beautifully... Damn it Ben -- Alright starve. Then have a donut -- Fine. Fine! Eat in the cupboard. Oh my God. That is so not funny. You're late. You're really late. Now get out here and have some cereal. Sure. I was just doin' my nails. And when did that pass? You say that like I don't know that. Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow... No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to keep , not a job that's hard to lose , can't be both. Duncan. I've got an even better idea... They're losing one mother. They can't lose two. Which part of no don't you understand? I've got it. It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th... It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab... Duncan. My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again. Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing -- You know, there's nothing you have to say. Because they know your heart. You don't have t... Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds. You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know. You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's happiness has been wrapped up in you , every moment... You ride with Annabelle... Everything. You're...the Earth Mother incarnate... With good reason. They fucking worship you as it is. Uh. You hate my guts? Ben never mentioned it. You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 seconds , you could find him from a coma , there is no WAY! You're lying. Maybe I was wrong on that one. Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh? You die young, you always look golden. Perfect. The memory kind of burnishes the image, and... I never wanted to be a mom. Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life... And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be. And I can't handle it. I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love... Don't flatter yourself. I always liked that line. Double. Neutral ground. What's up? That's what it is. And that's all it is. And she'll fight back again. God help me, what have I done. She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering yours . Oh please. You weren't passing 'em out. That's not wh... She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni... Worked. Like a charm. Aw. Right down to the ground. Let's get to it. Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA? Give 'em my number. It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h... Don't be too sure. Are we. Looks nice enough to m... You really didn't have to come, you know. I'd have brought them straight t... He won't discuss it. Just calls it history. That thing you said before. Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood... And her...? My advice to you? Don't die. I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or... It's the same choice you made. Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna. I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n... It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others. It's just not the right time t... No. Hon, maybe your mom would like t... Yah? Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever. Needs to know when to find a Plan B. Cos Plan A is not and will n... Can I say one thing? I mean, the last thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b... Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti... And you said... I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.' Brad Kovitsky. You look sick. But you look... together. Mentally tough. So. Hopeful. Can I look at the pictures? Beats me. Ask your mom. Doesn't begin to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, this is serious. Right. Which is the whole point of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date. Anyway. He walks up to her on lunch yard today. And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.' As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit. They don't actually go to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're... Toi. They've been 'going out' for two weeks. She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it. That. And. Annabelle is over her head. With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky. So I have to tell you something in confidence... Luke's depo ran late. I promised I'd take notes. Okay, I'm undeserving. See, I know that. And cigarettes. I smoke, too. I don't, but... You bet you are. You're not dying. I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too. ...it's my problem, too. Luke. Can't live like that. We can't live like that. But I came here to... And I know checking into your life was inexcusable... Look, you've never liked me... You're taking the kids. And moving to San Francisco. You're not working at Random House, I talked to them. I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets. And the note. From your new boss. Uh. Have you told Luke and the ki... Hey, any help you need, we'll cover. Wowie. How wonderful! You feeling all right? When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you... Jackie? Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell -- What about obsessively picking her split ends? No way. I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens... I'm sorry, I just... Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's. Not personally. Why not just bring the whole toilet? I'm already on thin ice. Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me. What? And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors? I did it for her. I need practice. She already hates me. You've seen to that. I didn't do it for you. Believe me. I have a snoop. I don't recall inviting you. ...in. Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y... Jackie, if I thought for one moment... I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration. I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb... Yeh? Look, I... But it's not on the schedule! Maybe the problem is your kids . Maybe they're spoiled, coddled brats ! You're damn right. I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit. I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker. If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead! I have a life! No. I thought it might be uncomfortable for her -- I was in there in him. Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking. Forgiveness? For what , exactly? She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only... Nothing. Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you... Maybe you could back off just a little bit -- What is this? The Betty Ford Center? Can I please have a cup of coffee? This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays. I got it right here... I'm gonna get me a drink. How about the promises we make to our kids? About their future. Do we shrug those off, just that easily? Because you've changed so much. 'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?' No, here's ugly. 'I love you , babe. It's just our life together I'm not so sure about...' No, she threw you out. What a difficult woman. Excuse me. 'Things are so confusing for me, Jack. Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able. It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules. When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...' By way of saying you were unhappy. Let me put it this way. Hell, no. What do you call it? You told her you had doubts. ...while she watched the kids. Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer. But she said... You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another. Imagine my relief. So what's for dinner? Just like to make sure. That your past. And my future. Are real different. Hold your applause. We're not having fun, here. No problem. I know that. Great, wallow in guilt, you sure you're not Jewish? Are you hungry? You could make us something? It's just an assignment. It's no biggie. What's eight, ten years? Hell, you'll still be ambulatory. I think. Everything's gonna work out. The kids and I...we're going to love each other. Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing? I think so too... Oh my God. Are you serious? You haven't done one goddam thing to make any of this easier... Why are you taking this out on him ? Our weekend. At that sweet little B &amp; B. Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo... Uh. Annabelle's video report has been switched again. You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long! Jesus what did you see in her? I don't get it -- I just don't get it. Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand... Really? Look in your ex-wife's eyes. And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work -- Look. I know they hate me. I know how responsible, caring adults parent children. I'm bribe 'em. But 'em a dog or something. Maybe a Doberman. But? But what? You don't trust me to be alone with them. Can't handle them myself is what you mean. Can't. I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around -- For what? Jesus. So I'll have to order in? You'd rather spoil our walk home. Uh-oh. I mention marriage, all of a sudden... Ve haff to ta... The way you cook. If you could make love, I'd marry you. Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it! Boiling down half a ton of bones... Okay, if they're going to have a sauce, put something in it besides flour and chicken broth... Something came up. C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three... No. I'm doing it behind her back. Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer. In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she? Does Jackie know this?
