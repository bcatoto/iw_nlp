Who did you hear that story from? Youko told you? The other day, I... I watched this  strange video. With Youko and them. No, it�s not like that.  Nothing  happened! Iwata... he found this weird video.   Everyone was like, �What�s that?� so  he put it on and we all watched it. Just... weird, I can�t really explain  it.  Anyway, right after we finished  watching it, the phone rang.  Whoever it was didn�t say anything, but still... rumors. That was one week ago today. Busted, huh? Gotcha! Oh... I can�t remember. Masami! Masami! Yes? Oh, man! Yeah, I�ve got a friend over now.   Yeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye. The game�s gone into overtime, so  they�re gonna be a little late. Jeeezus, my parents... �K. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, don�t look right at the camera, Sorry. What I heard was, all of a sudden  this scaaarry lady comes on the screen and says, �In one week, you will die.� I heard that if you�re watching TV  late at night it�ll come on, and then your phone�ll ring. Mmmm... I heard some local station,  around Izu. Mmm-hmm. Well, no one that we know, right? I heard this from a friend of mine  in high school.  She said that there  was this one girl who watched the  video, and then died a week later.   She was out on a drive with her  boyfriend. No, their car was parked, but they  were both dead inside.  Her  boyfriend died because he�d watched  the video, too.  That�s what my  friend said. It�s true!  It was in the paper two  or three days ago. No... I heard this from my friend,  and it didn�t happen at her school.   She heard it from a friend at a  different school, she said. Mrs. Asakawa? Here you are. This same kind of thing happened  about ten years ago too, didn�t it?   Some popular young singer committed  suicide, and then suddenly there was  all this talk about her ghost showing up on some music show. Maybe that�s where it all started.   Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake Onna * story from again? A big accident? D�you think something like that  happened out at Izu? See you. They all died the same day.  Youko.   Tomoko.  Even Iwata, he was in a motorcycle accident. Because they watched the video. That�s what Youko said.  They all watched some weird video, and  after that their phone rang. She just said they all stayed  somewhere. There was a girl with Tomoko when  she died.  She�s had to be  hospitalized for shock. They say she won�t go anywhere  near a television. The bodies of those found were  Tsuji Youko, age 17, a student of  the Seikei School for Women, and  Nomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory  school student.  Both their doors  were securely locked. This is the first time I�ve -ever-  seen something like this. Couldn�t say, aside from sudden  heart failure. The autopsy came up negative. These two, about to go at it,  suddenly up and die for no  apparent reason.  Do -you- get it? They tell me that Yoichi came to  the funeral, too. They used to play a lot together, didn�t they?  Upstairs. This... this is where Tomoko died. Tomoko! Nice to meet you.  I�m Takano. Sensei, the people from the  publishing company called about  the deadline on your thesis again. Because they can never get a  hold of you. Sensei, ask them yourself,  please. Auntie? Aah, welcome!  You must be tired  after your long trip.  Please,  this way. Back in the old days, the Yamamuras used to head fishing boats out in  Sashikiji, though they don�t much  anymore.  You know, one of Shizuko�s  cousins is still alive. He�s just an  old man now.  His son and his  daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned  inn.  I went ahead and booked  reservations for y�all, hope that�s  alright... Hello? Thank you. Welcome. Well, I�ll be off then. Please. And for your rooms, how shall we...? �Sir. This way. Sir! Please, this way. Excuse me? It�s about Miss Shizuko. This is all that there is... ...yes.  This picture is from before  I�d entered the household.   I should go now. Sadako?  Was it you? It�s no good.  With the typhoon  coming in, all ships are  temporarily staying docked. Fishing boats?  Sir, without knowing  whether this typhoon is going to hit  us or not, I think it�d be better to  wait and see how things turn-- Mr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama... It�s too dangerous!  The thought of  anybody going out in this weather... When I got here he was just  lying there... His face... They say there�s a way you can stay  alive after you watch the video.   You�ve gotta make a copy of it, and  show it to somebody else inside a week. But what about the person you show it  to? Well, then they make a copy and show it  to somebody else.  Again, inside a week. Then there�s no end to it. That�s just it.  There -is- no end.  But  if it meant not dying... you�d do it,  wouldn�t you?
