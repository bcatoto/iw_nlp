Because...because he's twice the ant that you are. I could never go through with marrying you. I'm -- I'm an individual , and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose. Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now. I miss him already. He's...he's dead. You don't have to look for him anymore. He was eaten by a praying mantis. Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common... So, um...how was your day? What did you do? General -- we have to talk sometime! A few ? Z! what are you doing? Oh no... There's something going on, Z -- You held onto this all that time? Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess. Come on, Z. This is all your fault !!! Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know.... You were right...you were right! Z, it's beautiful ! What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire... Face it, Z, we're lost! We must have walked halfway across the world by now! How did I get into this mess... Well...I am the oldest. Well...no, but -- Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no. About five thousand four hundred by now. General Formica won't let me die out here. I'm his fiancee. Stop fooling around in there. Out here I'm just what? Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap. Wait, I hear something! Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me? We're going to die! My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life. Water...water... That's not a name! That's just a letter! Worker! Come back here now! Insectopia ? You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale! Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole! I didn't choose him. What kind of idiot would... ... choose who she wanted to marry? I was slumming it ! I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place! Ha! Don't make me laugh. You're crazy about me! That's why you lied and cheated to get near me! I -- hate -- you. No! There's no such thing as "just two ants." You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants! Of course! It defines society! To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself! How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess! I've been kidnapped by the village idiot. Climb up that tree and get a better view! I order you to find out where we are! What was that thing? SSHH!!! SSHH!!! Quiet -- sshhh!! I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER! OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU! YOU'RE A WORKER!!! A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER! He was a worker. I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I? No weirdly...You remind me of someone... You dance... No, General. I'm dancing with the war hero. Yes. I'm Princess Bala. You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you? Let me think. Hmmnn... Never. Bye! Uh oh. Goodbye! Gotta run! Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself? You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up! Why can't I just do whatever I want to do? Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo! You're right! Really? Are you sure this is a real dance? What ? I work in the palace, I don't get out much. Wanna dance? Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper. Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises. And do Princesses do improper things? I'm the Princess, aren't I? The worker bar! Yes! That's where I want to go! The Club's so stuffy . I want to try someplace different. Mom! Who is that idiot? Yes...he's wonderful... You did? It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?Bala! Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave! Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings. The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged. Even marriage. You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood. I felt the same way before I got married. Confused. Scared. Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General. Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play! But General -- this tunnel is your baby! You're sure you can't stay ? All these parties are so marvellously alike . Look, General! A darling baby soldier! Don't try to be a hero! Just make sure you come back in one piece! Next! Yes, General Formica. Carry on, my good man! I don't know what we would do without you. No snacking between meals! Off you go! Now -- what were we saying? Yes, what else? General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony... pains me. The thought of any of my children going hungry... Who's the cutest widdle worker? You are! Yes, you! Don't forget to brush your teeth! Ship 'er out. What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
