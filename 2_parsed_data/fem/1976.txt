Yes. Oh yes. He was after you. I remember. You're running! That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning! He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran. It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc....and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him... Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after -- No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest! When do you go up? Why aren't you in Nursery? Where do you live, Mary? What's your name? Is it inside the city? What does that water do? Beloved husband... And Sanctuary? "Beloved son"... So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered. I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way? I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want. You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!! Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together! You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen! To what? He asked if we would bury him when his time comes. You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!! There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!! There's a Sanctuary... there is! He had a mother and father -- and he knew them. Look at his face... and his hair... Is that what it is to grow old? "Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean? Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad? Then the answer's yes... ...But I still have the choice...? You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want? What does it mean? Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they? Maybe we're the first ones to get through... Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside. Do you think he was telling the Truth? Don't ever let go. Do you think everything's going to turn to ice? It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired. Don't! I hate outside! I hate it! And yours. What's that? For us. Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you. I wanted to... ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen? You're really one of us now, aren't you? I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but -- Are you glad you didn't kill him? I'm afraid. Ycch. To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world. What do you suppose this was...? How do we know this is the right way? Will you take me with you? They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure. Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you. Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me. We'll convince them. They won't listen. They won't believe us. He's good, isn't he? Yes. I don't know what else to do -- with him following us. Why do you keep running from your -- No. Not that either. I -- I can't. Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now... Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you. I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed. Muscle? I don't know that one. But what is this -- why? I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green. What would you like to relive, Logan? I have. I'm only telling you what I've heard... Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...? Some people say children need human mothering. Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders. I'd rather be with you. You're not going, are you? We're coming to Arcade. Shall we Relive together? Of course -- I wish I knew what you think I know. I wish I could help you. What're you going to do? What do you need? I never heard of a Sandman running... ever... Please? What friends? I don't.. And then you killed him, right? Where did you get that? How can I? I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has. About running, dying what? Why tell me? Why show me? I don't believe you. There has to be more. You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want? Then it's still no. Thanks... but I have the choice. I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose? Here I am. Shall I come in? You could have called me yourself. K. Six. I go red next year. I didn't say that I would run... I just... I suppose. But what if you want to live? Why is it wrong to run? I'm afraid to tell you. Not about that. How a Sandman lives. Curious. I changed my mind. I thought I had to do something. No. No. Jessica. Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit. Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill. He was killed. A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone. Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake. No. No. Just no. Please... No. Goodbye. Come with us. We'll remember. But that's a long time off... At least it's over... What's that? What people? What belongs to the people? No. I don't know. Are you sure? And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother? But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady. I'm very smart. Here. I'm Mary 2.You don't seem quite sure, Jessica. Can you do it? Will you? Too little. I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh? Travis? Thank you, Travis. How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers. Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days. Hello, Travis. Keep it. I'm getting a taxi. It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis. No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all. No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home. My God! I mean porno movies. You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to? These are not the kind of movies I go to. I'm leaving. What's wrong? But this is a porno movie. What are you doing? So you haven't heard this record yet? Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music. Travis, you haven't even played the record? You didn't have to spend your money -- ? Kris Kristofferson. The singer? That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". You know what you remind me of? You must be rich. You mean you work seventy-two hours a week. What hours do you work? That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet? Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night. That would have been quite a coincidence. The DMZ? You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable. Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else. Huh? Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis. The moon? That's really something. What did you do? Really? What kind of people? After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while. So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night? Where do you live? Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before. We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering. Thank you, Travis. Yes? All right. All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie. I don't know... Why? Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do? Well, we're all working tonight. If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something. Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging. You want to canvass? Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president. Is that so? But what do you think of Charles Palantine? No, I don't think so. That's someone else. What is it? I'm busy. No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure. No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point. First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it. Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary? As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them. He's Black, OK? No, why? He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when -- No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can. Oh, are you all right? This I gotta see. Try holding the match like this. I don't know -- but it feels like a long time. That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here. Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us? Have you been noticing anything strange? That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious -- Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it. Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere. Just what? Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious, Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings? Oh, Tom, please. No, I didn't forget "sexy". First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man. Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway. Tom, come here a moment. I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county. And don't forget to add the new photo releases.That's a dollar forty-seven. We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola. Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want? Awh, come off it, Pal.What do you mean? You don't have to. I sure hate to go alone... Sure you don't want to come with me? Do you really think I should go to the commune? You're not much with girls, are you? God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue. How? Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once. What should I do? Call the cops? Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls. God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me. Yeah. You a narc? What's so important? Why? You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell. Why not? Why don't you come to a commune with me? Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here. What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from... I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs. I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well. He never killed nobody. He's a Libra. Who's a killer? God, you are square. Didn't you ever hear of women's lib? Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there. Pittsburgh. ...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out... Well, you want to or not? Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow. That's not hard to do. I understand, mister. It means something, really. I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself. I can leave anytime I want. I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away. You can do it in my mouth. Don't you want to make it? Can't you make it? Oh, come off it, man. I musta been stoned. Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live. You want to make it like this? We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it? I don't remember. No. Why? Who are you? That's what you think. Iris. I don't like my real name. It's easy to remember. Easy Lay. Easy. It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long. That cigarette burns out, your time is up. A girl needs protection. All right. You see that guy over there? His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here. You looking for some action?Nice talking to you, Travis. I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes. There must be something... Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most? I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors. Why, thank you Travis. Yes I am.It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere. ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it. --omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it. There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names. The ones who could disburse the money. I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried. A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that. There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot-- ...No... never in so many words... One minute but then-- I never worked for Sloan or Stans. I'm relaxed--light your cigarette. All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff? You've really got to go.I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine. That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign. I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper. I know I shouldn't tell you this... ...you're definitely doing a story...? ...check...?You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl? I thought you had to get to Miami. Give me your checkbook then. You're two months behind--you got enough to cover? Lot of pressure at the Star. Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this. How much did the damn bike cost? Carl, it's a jungle. I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles. You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for. Where are your bills, Carl?We're a long way from high school, Carl... ...and I'm scared. I don't know what they'd do to me. You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it. This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all. Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we? I really want to know. You've never told anyone who he is? But you'd have to tell me if I asked you. Tell me. But it's possible. And the underground garage one. Would I know him? Never? Please don't tell me never. Ben says you've found some wonderful sources. When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all? Are you sure? You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?" I woke up again last night with that same question. Are we right on this story? I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--Well of course. He is not in the car. Sorry. I told you, he had to go out on a case. And you will. But not now. I'm so glad. Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and-- Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy-- Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man. Sorry. Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--I'm not Miss Abbott. The what to what? --I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.Don't say that. Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard. What're we going to do? Apollo? ...What? Is everything all right? What did you say about a pet shop? What was that you said about a pet shop? Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to. ...Yes -- ...Are you going to say anything to him? Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help. ...And he called the reporters -- I thought it might be cute. -- The legs. Don't want weak legs. Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine? Like? Don't you open them anymore? Yes. I'll be waiting. Absolutely -- What time should I expect you? I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that? Don't tease me. ...What? ...T-thank you. What? I should leave. I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable. ...I've never been in a man's apartment before. No, I don't belong here. I don't think I belong here. It's not that -- It's fine. I think he might be worried. Yes. Yes, I do. I wanna let my brother know where I am. Do you have a phone? I sold them to you. ...No thanks. 'Cause you can't sing or dance? Why do you do it if it hurts so bad? Morning after? I don't think you're a bum. ...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter. It doesn't bother me either. ...I suppose. ...I suppose. My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.' By accident? Ohh! But you never had a chance to prove yourself. And you never got the chance? ...Aren't you skating? I think it's closed. It's Thanksgiving. ...Goodnight, Rocky. ...I don't know. ...I'm sorry. ...Fine. What?! Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me. Owe you what? Don't do that again! You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything! Only a pig would say that! ...Paulie. Stop now! Don't talk like that to him! It's not your house -- Paulie! Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance. Einstein flunked out of school... twice. You didn't! Oh, Rocky! Paul. Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven. I can't go out. ...Like you? Paulie, please -- No... I can't! ...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun. Buy us some Thunderbird, man. Hey, give Rocky a dime. 'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar. Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar. C'mon, man, it's cold, man. Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.Goodnight, Rocky. Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right? I won't. What? C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve. Why? Maybe I like garbage. I like yella teeth. ...Yeah. I like 'em. If you don't you can f -- Stuff it, man! Hey -- ...Screw you, yoyo. ...Screw you.
