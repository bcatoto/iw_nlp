Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable. Bye. breaks down into heavy sobs. She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . . I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone. Is it hurting, dear? frowns at Henry. Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing. pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline. I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side. whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room. and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery. Come on! Sausage rolls. I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator. playfully shoves his hand away. looks down at the ground in front of her. Oh, no. I'm watching my figure. That's enough, Yvonne! Love, you can still write to each other. stands and walks toward the door. You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!! Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us. Open this door! All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way! You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer. is very angry. These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them? snatches up an exercise book from a large pile. You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing! I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education. She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate. It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart. steps back. whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek. My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart! grabs Pauline by the shoulders. sighs. If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect? From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you. Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet. Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital. holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it. You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't! starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline. You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill. Come on, sit up. comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast. leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room. glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand. Well? Tell us! How'd it go? I put on a lot of weight over Christmas. Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl. turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag. is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently. Oh-what a nice outfit! Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket. stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand. We don't want to tire you out, dear. looks startled at the outburst. I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health. gives her a sympathetic look. That's coming along well! It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit. hurries over. I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger! I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate. and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based. Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head. I adore anything to do with the arts. I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular! Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy." But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper! Fruit. Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper. Hello! Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul? I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued. They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health." I'm saving them for a rainy day. I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch! Thank you so much! I'm so happy to see you! Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it. Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council. And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage! Isn't it beautiful! Goodbye, Mr. Rieper. I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge! Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she? All right, then. Mummy! Yes . . . But that's not true! I've got one. Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other. Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy! Poor Mother was completely taken in. That was what we were led to believe . . . That's great! We'll have the fare in no time! This lot's got to be worth 50 quid! They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times! I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage! Hurry up! I'm freezing! You mean travel by ourselves? No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers! How do you know? Did he tell you? That idiot boarder? What?? I couldn't have done it without you, Charles. I shall call him Diello. It's so beautiful! God, yes! That. This. Him. To be known as He! James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints. I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians. Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum! Don't . . . please! Please, don't! Of course it matters! It's Mario! 0h, God . . . I'm so sorry! Somebody's got to help us! Mummy!Look, Mother! You have it. I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain! I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out. You have to let me go! I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa! The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them! I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake! I don't wanna be in bloody school! What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met! I'm educating myself! Who cares! What does old Stew want? My name is Gina! You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me! Well, I guess I take after you then! Can I go now? I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture. But she'll have no one to look after her! Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away? I just want to be on my own for a while. I'm not hungry. I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too. He's the manager! Got an A, Mum! Hello! Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy! Bye, Dad. I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . . It's a three-act story with a tragic end. Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night. Mummy! I know what to do about mother. I'm coming with you. I need my sodding parents' consent. Poor Father . . . Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws? I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill. I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office. I'm sure they'll notice things missing. Just a couple more . . . Stay still or they'll be blurry . . . Let's go overseas . . . I think I'm going crazy. Well . . . no. But it's so obvious. John has fallen in love with me! You'll never guess what's happened!! You're such an incredible woman. What??? What? He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her! That . . . This . . . Him . . . He . . . Saint Mario! But, we're all going to Heaven! I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus! I think I'm dying . . . It doesn't matter. She's terribly hurt . . . Mummy!
