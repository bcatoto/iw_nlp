Failure has no pride, Victor. You  must try again. Of course, Doctor. Madam. Come along,  Justine. Bring your dolly. Victor. This is Elizabeth. She's  coming to live with us. You must think of her as your own  sister. You must look after her. And  be kind to her. Victor. Elizabeth is frightened by  the storm. Go comfort her. Aren't you? Are you sure it can't hurt us? You must lead, Victor. The lady will  always look to you for guidance, so  your steps must be sure and strong... ...aaand, one-two-three, one-two-  three, twirl-two-three... Mama, can I dance with Victor? Nonsense, Justine. Hush. And now a  sweeping arc about the room! one-  two-three, twirl-two-three. ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three...  Excellent! You'll be the envy of all  the young ladies and gentlemen! Justine. Surely you can maintain  better time than that. Yes, Mama. She'll be all right. You can do nothing here. Wait  downstairs. Oh God. The blood. It's not ours to decide. All that  live must die. It's God's will. She was mother to me as well. But  ours is the job of the living. It's  up to us now to hold this family  together. We must think of Father  and be strong for him. I cannot do that alone. He left a beautiful gift in her place.  A baby boy. To cherish and love as  our very own. Your brother Poor William! What indignant tears! There, there... shhh... Victor, have a care! You'll make him  dizzy! Oh, do give him here! He needs to be  comforted and held! That's the nature of all progress,  William. Don't let your brother sway  you otherwise. Quite right! Give me that child before you fill  his head with drivel! Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad! Scandalous! What would your dear  mother say? One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three... You can. But not before dinner. You dance so beautifully together. And you look so lovely. Victor? Spare me one dance? Go on, ask her. Please. I'm quite  out of breath. Smell the air. Wonderful. Father's so proud. Prouder still. You'll be the  handsomest student there. You will. What do you want, Victor? No. Just very earnest. And very dear. All my life I've known. Is that what makes it so delicious? Brother and sister still? I wish to be your wife. If only I could. But one of us must  stay. Father's not strong. Willie's  just a child. Who can look after  them in your absence? Who can run  the estate? I will be here when you return. My head is spinning. I want to give  myself to you. If we're to be married, must we wait? Not as weak as I. Our decision. Together. I give you my soul... Victor. I love you, No real rooms left. All we've got is  attic space. No one ever wants the  attic space... Let's return a tenth of the crop to  the tenants. They had a hard winter. Then there's no need to tell him, is  there? ...and not a day goes by that I do  not cherish your faces in my mind's  eye or ache to see you all again. Be  assured that I am with you in spirit,  and you are never far from my  thoughts. I remain, as always, your  loving and devoted Victor. P.S. It says, give Willie an extra big  hug for me. I knew held get himself in trouble. Must've been a terrible row. He was almost expelled for calling  one of his professors a "pompous... Fellow..." He set things right with a proper  apology... and now they've put him  in charge of dissection lab! It's far too ghoulish for your young  ears. The point is, your brother is a  brilliant student well on his way to  becoming the finest-and most  compassionate doctor ever... Pox? They givin' us pox? Vaca-what? Nothing. Still nothing. It's been months. It's not like him. Something's wrong. I know it. I've heard rumors of cholera spreading  south from Hamburg. So have I I should go. I should leave today. Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into  Germany would be banned. You'd never  get near Ingolstadt. Besides, they're only rumors. And not a word of them to Father.  He's agitated enough not hearing  from Victor. Read him one of the old letters and  rephrase it. We'll say it came today.  It'll set his mind at ease. Here! What do you think you're doing? BURN HIM! BURN HIM! Bring Grandfather to the table. We'll sell another pig at market. We'll make do. We always have. It's the Good Spirit of the forest. Of course it is. Now finish your  food before it gets cold. ff..reh..nn..nd. Friend? Friend. Good! And now the next Your hands are bleeding again. Come  in. I'll rub liniment. Good. And the next. Very good! Maggie. Try the next. Maggie! Thomas! You'll catch your  death! That one! It's the most beautiful  tree I've ever seen! Merry Christmas! ...with particles of heavenly fire,  the God of Nature did his soul  inspire... and pliant still the  ethereal energy which wise Prometheus  tempered into paste... Such a terrible winter. I'll praise  God to see those gates open again. Who? Victor? Thank God. It's beautiful! May I? He looks so handsome. Let this locket be a token of the  vow we took the night I left. He's coming home to marry me. That's wonderful. Willie, it's not a toy for your  friends. Don't dawdle. It'll be dark in a few  hours. Justine! Pay attention! Yes, Mother. Are you all right? Fine. I'll be all right. Really. Is he not back yet? It's far too late for him to still  be out. WILLIE! WILLIE! Sir. I'm terrified for my girl. What is Father's outlook? Thank you, Henry. Victor? Victor! It's you! Thank God! Is it true? What they say about  Willie? Is it true? Willie. My poor little angel. Victor! They think I did it! I don't believe... I am in need of  your comfort... anymore. Get out! Justine and I grew up as sisters. I  know her better than anybody. William was as much her child as  mine. We were both mother to him. I believe she would sooner have  strangled the life from her own body. I consider the charge imbecilic. Yes. I took refuge in the barn.  Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm?  Freezing and wet? I was exhausted  and could search no longer. I have always loved him. Murder Willie? In my heart, he was  our child. Victor's and mine. Such a  thing could never have entered my  mind. I have no knowledge of that. But why risk yourself? Hasn't this  family suffered enough? If what you say is true, it is a  matter for the police! Do you know this man? Is there  something between you? I thought I'd never see you again! What sort of task? What of our marriage? Victor, we've  had so much tragedy. I want this  family to live again. We need each other now, I need your  comfort and strength, not separation  and solitude. Why the change? What about your work? It is Does this have something to do with  that man you saw? Victor, tell me why! Trust me! You're soaking. Brother and sister no more. I have been waiting for this ever  since. Victor! You don't want to hurt me. Vic... tor?
