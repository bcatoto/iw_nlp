You mean a Tesla coil? And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married -- Yes! I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action. GOODBYE, PENIS! WRONG! I'm getting my first series of hormone shots! And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN! Mexico! And guess what I'm going to do there?! So guess where I'm going next weekend?Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie. Now that it's done, so am I. I'm tired of living on the fringe. Ed, it's over. I need a normal life. But what's our relationship? Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance? Eddie, what's my motivation? Wood Productions. The mark of quality. Oh really? How much money did he put up? I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here. Say, who's the lug? Of course I'm here. Today is the file clerk's big scene. I'm going to my mother's. You're a fuckin' mess. That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend. That's moronic. Why would a bit player impress a backer? I told you this was gonna happen. Like what ?! I wanted you to say, "No! I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores." Who do you think's been paying the rent?! Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?! All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes! Don't get angry at me. Maybe you just need a day job. Ed, the landlord doesn't care. Ed, the landlord called again. He wants his money. Well maybe you're not studio kind of material. Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself. That's ridiculous. Ed, it's just one man's opinion! Toss us out on our ass. But Ed, we're not even married. And you don't have a job. I don't know. It's so much money... Ed, who is Daniel Davis? Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS! How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people? Oh, just like in the script! That's not the issue !! Ugh! How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?! Oh! You got nerve, buddy. And what about this so-called "Barbara" character? It's obviously ME! I'm so embarrassed! This is our life ! What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?! What kind of sick mind would operate like that? Jesus Christ! And you never told me? How long have you been doing this? Ed, I'm so proud! I'll read it as soon as I get home. So did you get his autograph? Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture. I thought he was dead. You met Basil Rathbone! Boris Karloff!? Who? Robert Taylor?! Better than not getting a job? You got the job?!! Eddie, I don't understand. Why are you the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story? Ed, you're still young. This is the part of your life when you're supposed to be struggling. Ed, it was only one review. What?But it's pouring. And the car top is stuck! Huh?! Ed, I'm so happy for you. Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere. My chiropractor! Look, it's Dr. Tom. Hey, Dr. Tom! You should feel lucky. Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people. The poor girl's out of a job. The sun. Dynamite -- Uh, atomic energy? Do you want your buttons on the left or the right? Well you tried -- Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- you're not ! What was that? Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious. STOP! Oh. Okay. Does this mean you don't like sex with girls? Huh? A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live. I thought he was much scarier in person. That is incredible! You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie. "Dracula." You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw. Your friend's. Oh. I loved those shows! "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" -- Did you find it boring? Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners. So have you always lived in L.A.? They're very nice. Let me get my coat. Oh, flowers! I didn't know you were so traditional. He's better. Thank you for asking. How's your friend? You look beat. Oh, it's you again. This is my thirteenth pair. Booties for my father. He gets cold in this hospital. Oh. My condolences. Oh. Congratulations. Hello. You're sleeping in a tuxedo.You misunderstood. I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars. What other sixty-thousand? What are you looking at me like that for? I already gave you my three hundred. Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you? Eddie, which dress do you like better? Hmm. Those sound kind of small. Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton. I'd sure like to play her. Oh my, this is very interesting. Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts? That's all?? That seems very reasonable for an entire picture. Perhaps a small amount of money. How much do one of your motion pictures cost? Yes. Hollywood is oh so exciting. Pleased to meet you. I'm Loretta King.No you're not! This marriage was never consummated. I'm getting an annulment! What the heck is THIS?!! Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before. My goodness, you're embarrassing me. Wow. Ah, c'mon! Nobody does all that. What are you, an angora wholesaler? I suppose. It's very expensive. Why... yes.What's uncanny? Exactly. Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines? I'll do the part mute! Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie? The Ghoul's Wife ?! God, I can't believe I'm doing this... It's terrible. People won't even return my calls. It's like I don't exist. Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"? Look buddy, I'm a big star. I've got real offers from real studios. I don't need to blow some dentist for a part. So forget it! Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat -- You want me to show it on my TV program? Well I got nothing to do with that. You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven -- I don't understand. Do you want my autograph? Yes? Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type. But keep in touch. Let me know when your movie opens. Isn't that the same thing? You mean like a date? I thought you were a fag. Oh. Yeah. You. Who?
