God !...... No !...... She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put  You are the goddamned enemy, Capa, you and this all tower of psycho-babble. You know what I hope ? That God gets real pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points straight down to Hell, where you belongs !...  Now, I finally get it : you're are like my ex-husband. You think that everything got to be either black or white because you got color-blind. But God is on my side now. He knows I'm not like you  We all do what ?  I don't know what you mean.  What a depressing view of life you have, that is such horse-shit !  No, why don't you tell me  Which mirror ?... This mirror ?...  I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the view outside actually...  Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Los Angeles. Please remain seated until the aircraft comes...  Casey, you're such a weenie !  I do too.  Why not ?  Oh, my dead husband is paying for mine, and I still care.  Nobod... Nobody wants to say no... I'm Sondra... How are you, Bill ?  Oh, that's helpful. Very macho of you  OK... My name is Sondra Dorio... and... I always marry older men but... ... I am single now... and I keep... I... I want sex all the time... But I mean... I really do... want... a real relationship... and... sometimes, I steal thing... I mean, they're little thing... ... It doesn't make any sense. It's hard to... You know, I... Is that OK !   Richie !  You are an asshole !  Why don't you stop feeling responsible for everyone.  Oh ! That's very nice !  Can't you ever be serious ?...  I can't stand smoke... OK ?  How come you don't listen to Clark ? How come you don't do anything about this, Bob ?  You smell like an ashtray.  Hi, Richie !  Come sit down here.  ...She's like a daughter to me... We hang out... Meaning that... It's wonderful...  Bye...  I'm going now. You want me to lock on the way out ?  Why me ?... Hi !... I'm Rose.  I got no insurance... I know it's against the law and everything. Don't bust my chops. I'll bring the money to you, if you just get an estimate. OK ?... Just give me a break !  Oh, poor old brain can't remember its own phone number.  I will.  Hey !... Don't you want my address ?  Oh, I'm sorry... Class was really, really really late.  Where is Doctor Moore ?  What's the matter ?  I'm trying to pay attention... Shhh !  Why ?...  Ohhhh !  Here ?...  This man was Bob's best friend. Do you really needed exact numbers now ?  Get your fucking hands off me...  What are you saying ?  It's not the robbery he's an expert on, it's the rage.  Maybe you should.  Why ?...  I have a librium...  You were Bob's best friend... You... you seem kind of like him... I'll be so much easier to trust you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hello !  Hi !... Remember me ?... Fender-bender !...  So... did you get that estimate ?  Waow !... Nice place you got here. It's a little cold... but it's kind of tasteful, right ?  You too, I guess.  So... Are we eating in here, or you take me out ?...  You can't ? ... At all ?... Waow !...  Not even a shade of pink ?... Can't tell me if it's smeared or not ?  Really !... That's sad !... You know what ?... In respect for your infirmity, I'm gonna give up wearing lipstick. There is something about me that I bet you find a little strange. Right ?  Well, I haven't asked you what you do.  Well, it's because I'd rather guess. You know, I actually get upset if someone tries to tell me before I can... figure it out for myself, you know ?  Why... Why should you be ashamed of being a shrink.  Well... Are you ?  The way you looked at me, you know ?  You... you have this kindness in your eyes. But I think you're using it to keep me away. You know, you're trying to play safe. You're trying to think of a case instead of thinking of a female.  I guess we have a lot in common.  Why do you say I'm playing a game?  Yeah, that's... That's exactly what I am.  Yeah. Sort of like... not seeing red?  I was afraid during dinner that you had taken a room here... and I might have to decide whether or not to go up with you.  Oh, I need a taxi. Taxi !  I'm just beginning to think that maybe I'Il...  Well, I'm thinkin' you should stay exactly where you are, 'cause... In that condition, you'd get arrested. Start another riot.  Why? You want to make me fall to earth and burn my feet ? Whatever happened to quicksilver and light as air?  Hi. It's me, Rose. The old fender bender.  It's red, poor thing.  I was thinking. Maybe I should see a shrink.  I feel better already.  This time you won't miss. Underwater shot. They keep on kissing in the water. Bill takes Above water shot. They are now in the water up to their waists. Underwater shot. They are back underwater. Bill is kissing Rose's Above water shot. Bill is leaning his back against the edge of Underwater shot. Rose is kissing Bill's chest et goes slowly down  I want you to get dressed up... Get dressed up... All right ? I want to get dressed up.  Uh-huh.  You're not eating. Don't you like my food?  Okay. But if you don't like this... I have something else for you. She laughs.  I think it's ready.  Nobody's like your ex-husband!  That's for sure. That's for sure. Okay, okay, okay.  Here it is. Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful. Isn't it great ?  I know. It's incredible. Look at all these bags.  Oh, the man that was staring at you in the shop... was so funny. I think I should have got it in green or something.  Oh ! Oh ! Lush ! What do you think?  I think... you look beautiful.  You sure ?  Oh, yeah.  Come zip me up.  Okay. Okay. Oh, this is so tight.  Thank you.  I need to find a new husband. I need some more money.  Oh, men. Who needs them ? Have you seen my earrings anywhere ?  Yes, I've got them.  Oh, sweet ! Oh, my God. I love these. Aren't they pretty ?  They're so gorgeous, yes.  Try yours on.  Okay.  What now ? Sondra, what ?  I feel embarrassed.  Why?  'Cause... the way you're looking at me.  Sondra... Do men look at you like that ?  No... Yes... But it's different.  You know, Sondra... it doesn't have to be any different at all. You better get that.  Hello. Oh, h-hi. Um... Oh... Um, mmm, okay. N... My trainer's coming at 2:30, but that's... Yeah. You are? Okay !... Um, oh, there you are ! Okay, okay. I'll see you in a minute !  Who's that?  That's my analyst ! He's coming to visit me.  He what?  Oh, my God. He's coming over.  Sondra, thanks. Oh, thanks a lot !  What's the matter ? What ?  Nothing ! If you don't know, I thought we were just going to have a nice afternoon together... maybe have dinner.  Well, we can. Oh, don't worry. Don't be upset. You can stay here. Really.  You just don't understand, do you?  I don't.  Nobody appreciates you the way that I do. People just use you, and you don't even see it.  Oh, don't be upset.  That's more like it. Ciao.  Oh, my God.  Hi.  Oh... no. That was my, um... That was my girlfriend, Bonnie. Yeah.  Please, come in.  You think so? Thank you.  What did you come here for?  Richie's... my little baby.  That's insane!  That Dale is a dangerous bastard.  I don't have much to tell. Richie's okay. He's sweet. Did you know that he was... molested as a child ?  It's fashionable. I mean, it pays well. At least, you know, you can write a book, go on Oprah.  Oh. Let's cut to the chase. Richie did not kill Bob Moore. You know... it's really swell. Snooping around here... ... sniffing for blood on other people's hands... while pretending to help your patients ?  Richie wouldn't hurt a fly ! Why don't you take a look at someone dangerous. Why don't you take a look at someone who could do it ! Why don't you take a look at Clark !  Clark ! Clark ! Clark is a sneaky, lying, button-down son of a bitch... who pretends to be this gentle creature ! I heard him screaming one night at Bob. It made the hairs on my neck stand up ! Anyway... I hope that they fry... whoever did it, and it takes a really long time. And then... And then a fuse blows. They have to start all over again. We hear the front door chimes, and Sondra's expression changes She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips. Wow ! That's my trainer. I gotta go. I gotta get the door. This is my trainer, Chris.  I don't feel like lifting weights today.  Let's do something else. Through the low window, we see Bill going down the stairs to the  Yes.  How very enterprising of you.  My husband died last year. If it makes you feel better, he suffered a lot. Well, anyway, it made me feel better.  Why don't you leave me alone ?  You get out of here before I call the police !  Get out of here !  Sex.  Now ?  Well, I don't have an attachment in my life right now. The last one sort of went to pieces. If you enjoy sex... A man thinks you're doing it with everybody.  That's right. And I was as good as gold.  This guy had a major projection, and he couldn't keep it in his pants.  Anyway, I do have this girlfriend. She really makes me laugh. A wish list. I wish... she was a guy.  I agree.  Excuse me. You think you're gonna pass today ? Don't you think that's kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group ? I mean, we're all sitting here sharing our most intimate thoughts... and you're just gonna pass today ?  Your "little problems" ?  Ah, I see. You're smiling. Is that a smile ? You think this is funny ? Look at you. Just look at you. Look at your hair. Who do you think you are ? Huh ? You think you're God's gift to women ? Let me tell you something. You are nothing. Nothing but a shallow, rigid... self-protective, anal coward ! And I'll tell you what your little fucking problems are...  Hey. Busy day ? Can I get you something ? No ? Okay. Oh! I forgot about that ! Bill's face still looks very shocked.  Last time I was here, I stole the key. It was by the door.  Oh ! I never thought about that.  No. Um, did I make a mistake ? You have someone in the car ?  I just thought that it would be a nice surprise, that's all. You don't look too happy to see me.  I'm sorry.  I'll never take a risk like that again.  Christ, Capa ! I can't have people tying up the phone lines. I'm trying to run a business here.  Oh.  Yeah ?  How's the submarine fleet ?  Oh, you're chicken.  You're chicken.  You're chicken, chicken.  I love this song.  I know.  Hi ! Hi !...  What are you doing ? Wha... No! Don't ! Don't !  Ah !  Sondra, go !  Oh, I'm gonna go change the music.  Sondra, come here. Oh, come here. My God !  Oh, my God !  These are your neighbors !  They do this all the time.  Oh, wait. Watch, watch! No!  They're gonna see you !  Oh, I don't believe it !  Oh, this is the part ! This is the part !  Oh, my gosh !  Oh !  Believe me, they can fuck. Oh, I can't watch this anymore. I didn't see anything.  Oh, Sondra, go. I love this song.  Yeah. Close-up on the mirror, which shows the fire in the mantelpiece,  Sondra, through the window ! Look ! Look !  Oh, what are they doing now ?  I can't tell.  Are they gonna do it ? No !  My God ! It's gonna happen right now.  Ow !  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, champagne.  Mmm. We see Sondra's hand going down Rose's back, and slipping under  No, no, Sondra. I can't. I can't.  Why ? It's wonderful.  Sondra, I'm a jinx.  No. We can cancel each other out.  No. I'm not who you think I am. Oh, God, I'm in love with somebody and it's all falling apart. I'm sorry.  Look, the sky isn't falling down.  Yes, it is.  No. Let's get that silly thing off your head. There. I love your brown hair.  I'm back.  Oh, God. I'm so glad that you're here. I didn't know if you'd be in.  Yeah ? So, what color are my nipples ?  Oh, God. To be normal like this all the time.  You do ?  Oh, my.  She's pretty.  He looks so young here. God, how long ago were these taken ?  Really ? Do you have anything more recent ?  No. It's morbid. I don't want to see anymore. Let's go outside. Let's pretend it's Sunday. Yeah? You wanna?  What ?  Were you there ?  What did you see ?  Yeah.  Oh ! Oh !  I didn't read any of it. Really. I felt so bad when I got it home. I couldn't help myself.  It... The Van Gogh. But I didn't read any of it. Honestly, I promise !  You know, I can't stand this arguing. Really.  Oh, my God ! Oh ! This is my girlfriend. This is Bonnie.  Yeah. Yeah.  Shut up.  Shut up !  What are you getting at, Buck ?  That's right, that's it. That's right, That's right.  You're lying. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying ! I don't believe you !  You're lying to me ! Why are you lying to me ?  You're making it up ! You're making it up !  Stop it !  Where's the picture ?  Don't ! No more !  We didn't even...  Well, I didn't think to-to-to write it down.  You leave me alone ! Get away from here !  Why are you torturing me like this ?  You get out of my house !  You-You go away!  Go away !  Nothing.  I'm calling the police !  Please ! What kind of twisted creature are you ? I've never done anything to you.  Why in God's name are you doing this horrible joke ?  Richie Dexter is dead ! He killed himself four years ago.  Because he couldn't stand... what my husband was doing to him. He hung himself with a belt. He was 12. I didn't know ! I mean, how could I know ? Nobody knew.  He is survived by his brother, Dale. If Richie Dexter were alive today... he'd be 16 years old. He also had a sister, Rose.  Get away from me, please ! You'll make it worse !  L-I don't know, but he'll be back ! L-I don't know where he is.  No ! No ! L-It happened. It just happened.  When Richie died... Dale buried the body and then he said, "Richie, come here." And I told him, I told him, "My name is Rose !" He slapped me so hard, I couldn't get up. A-And he, he made me dress in these clothes... and h-he did things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore. I was Richie from then on.  After a while, I forgot about Rose. Then Richie got busted.  They were our world. They were our family.  No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie was first.  Help me, please ! Help me.  Oh, God !  Get away f-from me!  I never get to be out a-anymore.  And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift. It did. It did.  Oh !  No ! No, Dale, don't !  Dale, no !  No ! No !  No ! Get out !  My name is... My name is Rose. No ! No ! No ! No !  Don't !  No !  Why ?  It's too late. I've gone too far. I can't go back.  Why would you do that ?  Oh, Capa.  L... No...  Capa ! No !
