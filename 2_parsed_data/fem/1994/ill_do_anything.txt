Tougher than this?!? What did he say? What did they say about him? Will you get in here--for God's sake? It's on right now... right now...  right this second! You will miss  it!! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Look,  he even showed up. Of all the pathetic questions. We've been going back and forth on  our status for so long. I was hoping  that if you won, it might mean  something for us. Please go fast. I can't take you  dragging it out. I promised myself I wouldn't be so  bossy. Take your time!! Was that  bossy too? Do I get to vote? I'm going to tell  you something I never told you before.  Your feeling towards your work is  one of the things I love most about  you. Maybe the most. Stinker, I almost gave up on you. My mother said you were flirting  with the doctor during the delivery. No, I have a lot to do tomorrow,  too. I have to borrow on our Christmas  Club, I have to... Boy, am I reassured. What good news.  Isn't that a load off? I can't stand this anymore. ...You're taking her... You're taking  her... You're taking her... Well, I wanted to introduce you. As  if knowing me would help. It's a ridiculously awful movie. Stop. You're good. I'm doing them a  favor by getting you in. Claire, this is Matt Hobbs. Hi. Sorry. We're running behind...  Please forgive us. Matt Hobbs? Matt Hobbs! I'm not supposed to read TV pilots.  Don't call us D-Girls. We're  Development Persons! Hi. I just finished. I'll have my  coverage right over. It's past  derivative... it's photocopying.  What a hoot! You're kidding, right?  There is truly active bidding for  this book? Really? 2.3 million? Okay,  see you. Story, story, story, story, story. You loved it, right? I had some problems. Like what? Well, you know, it's a little  garbagey. So it has to be cast right. Hey. It's not like I didn't recommend  it. How'd it go? Good. His saver is he means what he  says. For when? I never know when I'm free. It sounds like I'm just... but it's  true. Well, don't please. Oh... well, don't please. Don't be sad. Oh, I was auditing this acting course  and he filled in teaching one night.  He did a scene himself and he was  awesome. For some reason, he can't  get arrested. We're 34 minutes late. The studio is  appropriately wild... people are  beginning to leave... but I knew how  upset you'd be if we started without  you. How is he tonight? Well, how would you say he is, anyway? The name of the picture you'll be  seeing is 'Ground Zero'... There may  be some scratches... some of the  colors may be off, there are no final  titles, and it has not been finally  mixed for sound, and the music is  temp, that means temporary... Please, God, let tonight give him  peace. We're short two card-counters, can  you two help out? Males, fifteen and under. If you'll just stay in your seats a  few moments and fill out these cards  for us... How long since you've seen your  daughter? Oh, please. It's one thing being a  son-of-a-bitch, but you don't have  to be a stupid son-of-a-bitch. People  move heaven and earth to see their  kids. I don't care if she moved to  Pluto, it's abandonment. Oh. Sorry. It wouldn't mean anything. Excuse me. Burke, ninety in the top two boxes. I never thought it would do this  well. There were so many holes; I  told everybody it wasn't going to do  business. Why am I so public with my  opinions? Not with that score. You know, maybe  tonight's the night I'm losing my  entire mind, but weren't you in  'Platoon?' But there was that one long close up-- where you seemed ashamed of yourself  but still arrogant. It reminded me of my last boyfriend. Got to go. Beast of burden. No. The definite recommends are way off  for a score this high and, even for  action-adventure, it's just too low  for women. I'm sorry. I know... And, unfortunately,  yesterday's tracking wasn't... I'm sorry... They just don't seem in  the mood for action-adventure right... Sorry... May I tell you one more  thing? I think it's so wonderful that you  don't worry about even trying to act  strong. I'm, uh... I'm blushing from head to  foot. So, thanks for lunch. I hope this  leads to an evening date. Though I  have to stay home with my daughter,  Leslie, on Saturdays. I believe you. And I was very surprised what you  were like when you weren't working.  There was absolutely no difference.  You want to see where we do the  tracking? Nobody ever wants to see how we do  the polling, but they're like little  starved puppies when the data comes  in--running at you, scrambling to... That's the same way I feel. Within six-point-eight percent. No... no... Sometimes just for myself,  I can't resist asking America a  personal question. When do you feel more worthless-- mornings or afternoons? There's something I meant to tell  you. You may have noticed something  unusual about me. I could never find the right time  to... Well, maybe not urgent, but  immediately significant and necessary  to tell. You see, there's these pills... So long. Hello--did you two meet? I just have to say goodbye. You have  no idea how difficult that is. It's not three weeks. No, it's not. You are not taking her for a visit.  You are taking her for a while. I don't have a choice. You don't  have a choice. I loved, helped and supported in  every possible way a business man  who committed the terrible crime of  being financially imaginative with a  pension fund. No one will ever love me as much as  you do. Good. Now, concentrate with all your  muscles and remember everything I'm  about to say to you... Don't talk to strangers. They may be  killers. Take your vitamins so the  poison in the food can't hurt you.  What else now? What? I'm giving Jeannie her  reminders. No. Don't. No. Don't dare. Don't  criticize the way I mother or I think  I'll start to scream and never st... Yes. You're not going to criticize me,  are you? Not in front of him--because  all he's done is send Jeannie these  long, stupid letters. He doesn't  even realize she can't read. He sends  letters to someone who can't read. It's almost funny. Oh. Typical cop talk. But I understand what you're trying  to say. Thank you. Can I have another  minute with her? Hello, monster-poop. Okay, love, Mommy's going to help  others who need her for a few years,  and you're going with Daddy as I  explained. We'll all have to help with the  luggage. Beginning now, you must give less  value to your own happiness and well- being, then hopefully, you will reach  the point where you give that no  value whatsoever. Give her everything.  There's no such thing as spoiling a  child. You don't really want to mess with  me, do you? I want to go with you. Can't, pretty-heart. I'm sorry. Not even a compromise? The compromise will be that you don't  have to ride in back; you can ride  up front with the driver... okay? Okay. Yesssss! Don't stare at me. I want to put on my yellow dress  now. I want to put on my dress. I want to  put on my dress. I want the yellow dress. Give me a compromise. Don't hit her. Noooooo. Let go of me. Noooo. The  yellow dress... let go... let go. These are the wrong jammies. Where do I sleep? That. Hug. Let go. Monica--is Leslie up yet? Good. I  didn't want you to get worried when  you realized I wasn't there. I'm  still with that man. I'll tell you  about it later. But it's sure nice  to have wobbly legs again. Look,  today's recycling day for Leslie at  school, so give her some empty cans...  well, then dump some out for her!  Tell her I had to leave real early  for work and I'll pick her up at  school myself to make up for it and  we'll rent any cassette she wants  for tonight. Thank you... Take good  care. No. I just had to call home. Is that  why you're sad? What happened? No. That's just you correctly  assessing the situation. So stop  being so hard on yourself. Hello. ...Who are you? I'm Lucy Crisala... What's your name? I have a little girl too. She's four and a half and I have a  little boy who is not yet one year. What can I do for you? Well, I'm always here. I could maybe  do it myself. Wait. Jeannie, why don't you come in  for a minute and meet Ricky and Essa.  Come on, we're making fruit bars. Why don't you leave her for a while  and then we talk. We'll just see how it works. Could I have her a little bit longer?  My little boy just fell and Jeannie  is the only one he let hold him. Okay. Seven dollars an hour? To be honest, I had problems with  'Ground Zero.' But this 'People Get  Hurt' one, while it might not be my  exact, exact thing, I think will  really work for an audience. It's so  over the top, you have a great time. Yes. Don't worry. My daughter used to  throw fits in supermarkets when we  first moved here. It's all so  perfectly normal. Plus I know a great  psychiatric children's group. Well, she's lucky to have a daddy  who cares, believe me. Oh, my. I've had exactly that feeling  and never said it out loud. See,  there are men who talk my language  and I'm just cursed that I'm not  attracted to them because they are  so nice they remind me of myself. Seven. Just a second... I felt terrible about the way I blew  up at you when I first met you. Please. I began taking anti-depressants when  we moved here from Washington. I had  some small reactions--sleeping 14  hours, no libido, I gained 17 pounds  in nine days--that sort of thing. So  they gave me pills to deal with the  side effects. And then pills to deal  with the side effects I was getting  from those pills. All this besides  the stuff the nutritionist was giving  me. The combination formed some sort  of potion so that I keep telling the  truth. I don't have a choice. That's  why I was so rude to you. Oh, yes. He's excited, but only  because he sees glory for himself in  it... See, ordinarily I wouldn't say  that about my doctor, but I can't  help it, it's the truth. He's  monitoring me for a while longer  before writing it up for this medical  journal... Burke's going crazy waiting for the  score. Coming. How are you, anyway? It's a tough one, huh? Me too. Oh, my. Matt, I'd better drive him  myself. I have to go. I have a nanny problem.  Priorities, right? Yes, I can. It's only a movie. Let go. Please, Lucy, don't make me  go. Listen to me, Jeannie... I want to live here with these people.  God, let me live here. I love it here so much that... Daddy says I can stay. I no think you can give her what  pleases when she act like this...  Because then she think... No. I'm not! STOP! Will somebody take a minute to look  over my casting list before Burke  gets here? Well, I wanted to put in people we  had a shot at getting. Could you at least take it one person  at a time instead of... What's wrong? What happened? I don't think the yelling is  necessary. If you didn't, you sure should have. I am. I'm not down for you. I'm down about  myself. Please listen to me. I just got this feeling of seeing  myself talking to you and how this  is the most important moment of...  ever. I've been watching this company make  movies that cost tens of millions of  dollars and all the while I've known  about this wonderful script which we  can somehow own and we could make  for about $14,000,000... $3,000,000  if you can live without stars or a  name director. I've sent you coverage on it nine  times. I swear to you, Burke, it  will work. You've never heard me say  that. I don't know anything about action- adventure!! I have no idea where that came from.  Hey, I know everyone thinks I don't  have any commercial sense because of  what I said at the 'Gremlins' preview  and all... And you think I can't put  myself on the line. Well, if this  picture doesn't work, fire me. Have  me killed if it doesn't get good  reviews. If this doesn't get a 70  percent definite recommend from women  49 and under, I promise to be your  sex slave until they drop ticket  prices back to five bucks and start  enforcing the R rating. You've got to do this. I think this  movie can save me. 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.' Why couldn't you even look at the  way I dressed Ricky? But what was it? Tellll me...  Compromise... You sad? You!! I know what will cheer you up. I can't even remember the words... I  am stupid. I am stupid. I can't even remember  the words to some baby song. Yes. Hi... What a pretty dress. Thank you. That's nice. Are you going to a party? Am I going to a party, Dad? I remember. Goodbye. I love you... Well,... thank you. What a little winner, huh? This is my favorite project. And it  looks like we're going ahead with  it. Well, come on, what's original? And  this is a wonderful rewrite. It's  funnier. Yes... Burke says I can test whoever  I want. He wasn't even surprised  when I mentioned you. So, if you  could read this rewrite now and if  you like it, we can make a test  deal... they can make a test deal... we can  tell them that they can make a test  deal. I think it's important for me to  steer clear of the business end. Longfellow Deeds. Who goes to town, yes. Stop being so creepy honest. I really  have an instinct about you for this.  I'm going home--call me when you  finish reading it. Or... come on over. I can't deal with your self-centered  dribble right now. I have just had  the biggest orgasm of my life and  I'm trying to figure out if I'm in  love with you. Whoops. Tell me what made you rush  over and pick me up and bring me  here at six o'clock. I mean we seem  to have... ...this unspoken agreement not to  talk about why we're together when  we're together and I don't think  it's good to let that become a pattern  for us. You're not at all aware that you've  just said something... ...unattractive? I'm not looking for an apology. Let's not make this about your  shortcomings. I'm sure you've had  enough of those conversations to  last you a lifetime. What I'm... No, you haven't what? No woman has ever told you that you  have an almost barbaric insensitivity?  That you seem to have lapsed into  some final cynicism, where you  actually believe that, not only does  everyone think the way you do, but  only you have the courage to express  it? That you seem horribly certain  everyone else is sort of pretending  when they talk about love or seem to  care for anything outside their own  anus? No one's ever said that sort  of thing to you? I'm here for the same reason 86  percent of older women loved 'Beauty  and the Beast.' I would like to  believe that underneath the creature,  there is a sweet, caring guy. I have to pick up Leslie. I mistimed it. I wanted you to catch me fully  frontal. So you loved it. A lot? A little? Do you see why I think you're right? You know this is really happening,  so I wish you wouldn't kid around  about it. There are some mixed signals coming  out of here, aren't there? Hi. Working... I can't write down a  number now. Call me back. The script? I want to hear everything. You want  to go page by page? Okay. Please. I understand. What do you mean? I'll tell you the truth, Matt. I've  never felt more like turning my phone  off. I don't understand what you're worried  about. But I get a lot of calls. I could put the machine on 'monitor,'  but it's going to be... I don't know. Okay. You look so serious. Please, we're making love here. Matt, Jeannie is very upset because  you are not here when you said. And  now the big hand is on the eight... It's all right. Jeannie's fine. There's a whole bunch  of kids in the building. She's  fascinated. And they're all ready  for you. You're the only one. No, it's okay, we're done. Sure. Good luck, Matt. The thing they're looking for most  is sexy. Who? Get out of my way! Don't say it like that!!! Which way should I? Get out of my way. Get out of my way. Get out of my way. Let me tell him, let me tell him,  let me tell him... Let him finish! God! I want to tell him. If you wait one minute, I'll let  you. Hey. Now? Wait till you hear this one. Some lady asked me to go in a room  and, you know, make believe and say  stuff like we were playing a game... And everybody went 'yea' and they  said they wanted me to be on  television. And give me money and have a teacher  there and a person to braid my hair  and color my face and give me  clothes... Don't! I'm trying to hang in here but  everything in me cuts off when  somebody acts this way. I didn't... She went for water and  by the time she got back, they had  offered her the part. Blame Burke,  he was there... The white kid in a multi-racial foster  home with all these kids of varying  ages. It's not a bad show. I sure  can't wait to see the test. No. They offered it to her off the  reading. I meant your test. Right away... You've got my vote. I'm doing it. Do I have to learn to read to be on  television? I'm so mad. I don't... why?!? Okay. So, no, you're cuckoo anyway.  I won't do it. And I don't care  because I'm be stupid at it anyway. I'm not going to talk to you during  Matt's screentest. Please. C'mon, Deeds, tell me about the  meeting. Don't worry about my crying. As a  matter of fact, crying turns me on. What happened at the meeting? I know. What did they say? I think he's a very good to excellent  actor--I do... But there's something... Well, six years ago, maybe. I think he's talented and attractive. He might be light in that area. The man is talented. If you get one  of those directors who like actors,  I think... We laughed. Everything doesn't boil down to... No... Hello. Matt... Hi... Okay, sure... Matt... Matt... Matt... Maybe it would be  easier if I just said 'hi' to her...  Hi, Jeannie... Yes, it's exciting...  No, no. He's right, honey, they get  somebody to read it to you. Now, put  your dad on--it's important. No,  first put your dad on... DAMN IT! ...Matt. Uh-huh, a few hours ago...  They all... everyone liked your work,  but I think they'll go for a name or  something. It's not a matter of doing it  differently... they liked what you  did, a lot... they laughed and...  it's not you... it's them. No, please. Don't thank me. If you  feel like getting together later or  anytime, call me, okay? You sound  like you have your hands full right  now... Goodbye. I wanted to talk to her again... Dad? Daddy? You didn't cried because of that...  I don't even want to talk to her. Dad. Can I say just one thing? You've got to make me supper. I can't hear you, but--hi, Matt-- that was funny. 'I don't think you have to worry  about that?' Eleven-year-old boys in the South. Burke? Burke? Matt, is he... But, hon... What? Very funny. Set? Okay. Set. Bye... Nooo. I've got to get to work. Is this the set? I'm glad I found you. You holding up? What did you do last  night after I called? Okay. Okay. So you don't want to  tell me. Be a tough guy. I feel relieved just seeing you after  all that stuff... whew... Okay. Burke wants to... Yes. Yes. Eventually. This is the thing that makes me  nervous about you... You keep on  assuming I'm nicer than I am. DAD!! There's such trouble. That's all?!? This isn't going to be good. I know what an audience is. Can you help me to cry? I miss my mother bigger than you  know. Mom? No... Nothing... Nothing...  Nothing. Nothing... Would you talk?  I'd just like to listen to you...  Wait. Let me sit down. Dad says he's going to make me to  really cry. She understands!!! He's being terrible right now. I love, loved, the coloring book you  sent me. Goodbye. Wait. I love you.  Let me hang up first. Love you. Send  me a letter. Bye. And a beaded T- shirt. Bye. I can't even understand what you're  saying now. Not very. I understand. So I don't trust  anybody, right? You don't make sense. I don't  understand you. Okayyyy! Who are we calling? "Very nice..." One... Jeannie... I can't talk now because... Wait, my dad wants to... Tell him I can't talk 'cause I'm on  the phone with a director... He wants to talk to you very much  and... I can't. I have to hang up. So she's too busy for you? Why do you do this to yourself? Why  do you insist on eating dinner in a  restaurant where you're bound to see  all the people you're afraid of? What do you call it when you think  that what a group of people think of  you can confirm or destroy any decent  idea you have of yourself? How did little Jeannie do today? What I asked was, how did Jeannie  do? Somebody else. Jeannie. How did she  do? I want to be treated as if I'm really  saying words to you which you engage  and respond to. I like Matt; I'd  like to know how his daughter did.  So before you take your dance of  desperation across the restaurant  and I end up feeling so sorry for  you that I could die, I would like  you to answer my question. I'm told that they're not going to  release it... Forgive me. But telling you about  this latest failure of yours--it  pleases me. I have no idea why. I think I am. It's just that rooting  for you is a good deal more  complicated than you realize. Don't go. Yes. I'm sorry I can't talk now. I'm  very upset about what's happening to  Burke, so I just made up my mind I  can't be witness to it anymore if I  love him and I certainly shouldn't  be here if I don't... so I was just  in the process of leaving when he  stopped me and you folks walked in...  I'm sure you've had something like  this happen to you some time... some  horrible thing in your personal life  happening in public. Thank you for understanding. Goodbye. I wish only good things for  you even though I feel I've been  really damaged by this relationship. Wasn't that spectacular? I've never  seen anybody that secure... You don't understand that I'm  exhausted from hurting. I'm through  with you. I don't know if I've been bad. I  know somebody's been bad. ...maybe it's you. Oh, I love you so much, I love you  so much... I love you so much. I can't believe I... ...got in this much trouble. . Word? I don't want to talk about it--just  say her stuff so I know mine. Okay. Okay... I don't want to do the 'I love you'  again. Yeah. Why don't you do that with  poopie Cathy? He said to smile all the time almost  and to talk... uh... Yes. Me. You're not in the show. This is so good... Really. Yes. So much. How do I do that one? Now? I'm on a roof... You're a... Okay. You know, I could get away now. But  I've got a big meeting later. We'd  better take two cars. See you later. Thanks again. Hi. Matt, will you take me off the  speaker? I don't know whether I'm being a  coward for telling you this way or  brave for telling you period... Can  you hear me? But I better talk fast because this  is where my phone always kicks out...  When we did your screentest... Can  you hear me? Well, I sort of folded on you at the  end. Matt? I did. Truly. But the discussion got  sort of dumb. It was a question of  sexiness. Well, sort of, yes. Well, I'll tell you. I certainly  must think so pretty much because I  feel great about where we're going  now... Are you very mad at me? You only think you feel that way  because you're on the verge of failure  and you're without a core... You know I've never hung up on anybody  in my life... because what if the  next thing they said solved  everything... but I must end this  conversation. ...and who just vomited. I just found out that we bow before  we even do anything. And everybody claps. I made up a great bow. You going to  look? I'm not going to be able to cry.  It's too hard for me. Matt. Matt. Matt. I'll talk fast. It's amazing news.  Oliver Stone's been looking for a  comedy and... ...he's doing my picture. Part of this involves you. He  remembers you from 'Platoon' and  wants to use you in this one. Got your attention, huh? I'm sorry. I guess it's because I'm just  incredibly insensitive to all human  needs. I'd ask you to save me, but  I'm so far gone, I wouldn't want you  to waste your time. You know, I don't have a kid or a  mate or a talent. I got this. And shoot me if I think it's  important. You think I'm a superficial jerk. You can't be right. Oh, great. It's like everyone is pi... ticked  off at me because I'm not colored. Look at me, I... Look at me. I love an African  American. You big stinker. My big stinker. Thank you. That's nice. I loved it, Daddy. No. This is okay. When I had to cry, I thought of you  buried in the ground. There's more? What will I wear? It didn't sell. It's the first time they had me do  cards for a pilot and the demographics  are all wrong for after nine o'clock.  That's their only opening. Hi. I'm Nan. I'm a good friend of  your Dad's. Hello, Nan. I'm Jeannie. Did you see  it? Yes, and you were wonderful. 89 percent likeability. And knowing that you were that good  means so much more than the show not  going. What? Oh, no. I couldn't help it. What does she mean? What do you mean? What does she mean? What do you mean? Oh, my God. And that means they're not going to  have a party? Oh... really?... good... can we stay  late? I cast him so he has to dance with  me, but I'm sure he'd prefer dancing  with you. Yesssssss. No. But I'll dance with you because I  think it will reassure me that I  should have nothing to do with you. Why are you breathing so heavy? What do you mean? ...whose name is? Okay. Last ones here. Oh, all right.
