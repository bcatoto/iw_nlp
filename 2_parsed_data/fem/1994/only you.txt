My name isn't Damon Bradley. I just told you it was Damon Bradley. Yes. We did. You're sure... Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too. Good. You're sure... Oh, right. Dwayne. You're engaged to Dwayne? What?... But... just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves. Your hair... is perfect. Yes. There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that. About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them. And the last line of it goes, "Who knows? Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--It was late in arriving. But it's here now. You don't understand. The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane. I-- I must've misplaced it. So. How do we get to Rome? Because. No... it's just very important that I find him, okay? Nobody here has any idea which way he went? He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here. Excuse me? You ask what room he's in, okay? What is it? What? It's alright... this is our destiny. We found each other, didn't we? Don't be afraid. You can tell me. Let's find a telephone. I've never been more sure of anything in my life. It just happened. I didn't plan it. I was alone. And he was... there. But now everything's changed. I owe it to him to let him know. I need to tell him. I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember. With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun... And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis. Okay. Good idea. You first. My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it? --separate, in the evening..." Dwayne Pinsley. From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport. And, he's a friend of yours. It's Dwayne. I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days. There is one other thing you should know about me. My car bumper has never held a winning sticker. I'm a liberal! No. You don't think this is just infatuation, do you? That's it. That's it. That's all I need to know. Bless you, thank you, thank you. What's mezzaluna? Ask her if she knows how I might reach him? If she has a telephone number? Ask her if she knows where he is? What?... I'll bring it back as soon as I can. Please, Larry. I have to hurry. Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is. I know where to find him. Larry, can I borrow your car keys? Larry! What are you doing here? Mom sent you. We'll KNOW. If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that. And stop talking. You're gonna ruin the spell. Don't be stupid, Larry. If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive. Wait. I have to write this down. Hm. Non. Please. Amazing. So, this is what you do? I mean when you're not playing other parts? Congratulations. No, you gave a very convincing performance. And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse. Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it. You... Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?... Where are you going? Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you. WAIT!! Where are you? Damon Bradley... I can hardly hear you. Could you spell that? I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that. Who should I tell him called? This is his fiancee. Who's this? He's not in at the moment. Can I take a message? Hello? Is anybody there? I brought you that, too. There is no us. That's not the point. And what if I had wanted to? Yes. No, it isn't. I called off my wedding all because of you. Gee, I'm flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead. Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy? I would call it-- unforgivable. A "little white lie"? A "little white lie"? Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you. You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it. I can't believe you did that! No one had to tell me. He's starring in the local play. Who cares?! You hired an actor?? What? You want a hint? I'll give you a hint. You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine-- GET OUT!! I just need to run up and get my bathing suit. Yes. I am. Thank you. So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime. I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans. No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual. Yeah... Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married. It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy. Like I was on drugs or something. No. I just came by to apologize. Hi. Are you... busy? No. Course not. No, it was more than that. It was very generous of you. It was very kind. I feel like the world's biggest idiot. Yeah. Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn. How about music? You like classical? Well, what about books? You like Hemingway? You gotta love Hemingway. So were you. Why are you doing this? I don't know if that's such a-- You were saying... What are you doing here? Thank you, Peter. Thank you so much. What? You too. Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs. Nothing fancy. Well, good. Good for you. Oh. That's nice. You found him. I don't know how to thank you. Hi, Peter. NO. Right now? Mickey Spillane? Please. I need to know. Tell me. He likes to read... Did he mention anyone in particular? Why? Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea. Where's Positano? Why not? Who says I don't love him?... Don't you see?.. We're not the ones who are meant to be. You're the man of somebody else's dreams. No, that wasn't a lie. That was... a mirage. So it wasn't real. Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking. We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie. What? Why are you asking me this? He wants to marry me, doesn't he? So?! Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe? Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me. Yes. Yes. If it's any of your business, yes. NO. I know I'm limping. I stubbed my toe. Oh, come on... What kind of an excuse is that? How could you do this to me? That was before I found out what it was. That's not the point. What? So, you say you've been to Italy before? Oh, hello. Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too. You like shrimp? I like shrimp. What looks good? Don't worry about it. You're my guest. Excuse me? Well, to-- new friends. Really? Sure. Oh, Faith. My name's Faith. Yes? Okay. Good. See you then, then. You would? Really? Would you be willing to have dinner with me? Any night. I was wondering... Do you have dinner plans? I just got here, too. Not yesterday. But, just now. Today. Just a few minutes ago. Yeah, we just got here... I mean, I just got here. I'm single. Been here long? Beautiful place... You're Damon Bradley? Larry, did you rent a car? I'm fine. Have you seen Peter? I don't know. I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation. Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for. And Larry?... Actually, no. There's not going to be a wedding. I didn't expect you back so soon. Kate is that you? So. I guess I've got a wedding to go to. I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel. I spent my whole life waiting for a creep. He's a jerk. Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it. Maybe I can change him. No, I think maybe you've been right. I think I may have been too critical in the past. No one's perfect, Kate. Kate. Thank God you're there. I need help. My God... you're right. What if he doesn't like me? Is Damon Bradley here? He's down in someplace called Positano. Peter says we can make it there by morning. Yes. Isn't that amazing? I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend. No. No, you go ahead. What? The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind. May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour. Peter? Peter was a mistake. An imposter. Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be. I've got forty-eight hours. I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened. It was a ouija board, remember? I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place. Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place? Children are very impressionable, you know. A little bad luck? Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning. This whole thing was just a wild goose chase. Packing. Hi. Where've you been? But how could he know? He only just met me. Don't be silly. How's a psychiatrist gonna find him? Like a detective. I meant about my idea. And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him. Okay, here's what I think. We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and-- What? Right. Okay... It's meant to be right? This is it. Right, right... Okay.. You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive? Is he looking at us? Oh my God. Where? Okay, okay. You join him. But first will you ask if he's here? Sure you did. Because I'm the one who's single. I told you. If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy. I just don't want to send any confusing signals. I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first? All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous. God, I hate blind dates. Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America? I don't know. I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden-- Right. My brother. Anna, I'm Faith. You don't know how happy I am to meet you. You see, I'm trying to find someone, and-- Larry bought himself cologne? And you know what I thought then, Kate? I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much. I still hope that. 'Course he does. I don't know, Kate. I just said that. I'm sorry. I'm just on edge. I'm afraid we're losing him. Sorry. You expecting somebody you know? Nothing. You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story. Right. So we should've been able to cover more of them. I told you a liter was less than a gallon. The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy. What was I gonna do? Tell him the truth? Only, it's in Italian... A phone message. Only-- We're saved! Oh. Right. Maybe there's fingerprints on it? A Butterfinger wrapper. Ah ha!... So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet. Maybe there's something in there that might help us. Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around. The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right? Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned? He fell out. Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for. I'll never meet the man of my dreams. We lost him?... I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone. Well, we're here. And more importantly, he's here. We'll cut back on everything else. Are you sure? What? I don't know... Maybe. Think of it as an adventure. It's called... the Gritty Palace. Now what do we do? Sure. I'm fine. I don't know why I never did this before. I mean, what's the big deal? You're coming with me? Maybe. How hard can it be? I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and-- He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. Thank you so much. No, I haven't. And you forgot about the fortune teller. Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. Of course not. I told him I was going to visit a great aunt. And don't tell Larry, either. Would you stop saying that? I need you to do me a really big favor. That's where you're wrong. I got one nine years ago. I just never had an opportunity to use it. I have vacation time coming to me. It's still the new year... It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it. The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence. It's a miracle. After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think-- Have you seen him with someone? Is that bad?... Kate, is something the matter? I understand, Kate. What do you think of this garter? I know. You're right. Yeah. I guess you're right. I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den. Oh, I don't know. I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies. I know... It was. Look how big it makes me look. I look like an Alp. Yes you did. Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place? No. He's never asked me. He's a podiatrist or something. I don't know, Kate. So, he's not my type. Let me walk you to the elevator. I don't know. I don't think so. No. No. I wish you didn't have to go so early. Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all. But somebody wrote those songs. Is everything okay? Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer. I don't have an Amana freezer. Don't tell me, Oprah did a show-- Scientologist. Just moved in with his girlfriend. No. He smokes. I don't believe in statistics. Yeah. He's around somewhere.Dwayne? Except possibly that. Nothing you could say would change the way I feel. No... Oh no. Do you?Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is. Of course not. No, she wasn't my sister. Yes, but... He was having an affair. No. No. Really. She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him. So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams. She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker. My friend has lost her fucking mind... He's gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport. What about Larry? Well... I ought to be getting home anyway. The kids'll be back from camp soon. The house is probably a mess. Oh. Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right? Uh huh. So... When you could've found one in America. Yup. Yes. He is. Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad. I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change. And he is living proof. Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless". Uh huh... Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway? Faith, I'm kidding. Is this how you plan to get what you want from life? When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it? It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable. Whatareyoudoing?! Joan Collins stayed here. Amazing... Peter found him? I'll be back before you leave. You sure you'll be okay? I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all. Who said I was going? What about Peter?... ...and a fortune teller. I know, but... So you're just quitting? Just like that? Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that means the odds are probably in your favor now. This is no time to give up. So, you've had a little bad luck. Why? Sightseeing... What're you doing? Hi-iii... Men have ways. Yeah. Sociopaths. They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that. No... Like a psychiatrist. I think it's time we got some professional help. That was really sweet... And then what, Faith? Well, nobody can say we didn't try. Good luck. Faith-- Faith. So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe. At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales. Nope. He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us. He's wearing a navy jacket. If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow. He's heeeeeerrre... Not if you don't count the sixth grade. I never even got to be single. Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you? So what's in a name? I wanna join him. I don't see why we can't join him. You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get? You're right. At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself. Smile. What's she saying? What did you say to her? Her brother. Polo. He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day. Did I tell you that? That was a long time ago. You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to? But maybe I was wrong. Maybe sooner or later everything wears out. You think he misses me at all? So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway? Well, you don't have to get snippy with me. What's that supposed to mean?... I'm hungry. We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost. Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile. Couldn't we just have taken a train? Your brother? Only what? What is it? We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him. A rich, possibly fat, slob. What'd you find? So? I just got a dial tone-- I don't think he understood what you were saying. What's the airport number? You can't really blame him for being upset. It was an Armani suit. What are you doing? Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good. You and the other 99% of the women in the world. You gave it your best shot. You tried. Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here. "Of the Rich and Famous". Of which we are neither. Are you out of your mind? We can't afford this. This is a Lifestyles hotel. "Gritty"? Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant? The book said they have boats that are like taxis... Vaporettos. What's the name of the place we're staying again? You okay? I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies. Live happily ever after. A foreign land full of millions of Italian men... speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin... You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets? My God, you have... I can't believe we did this. Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days? Does Dwayne know about this? Because you were afraid to fly. You don't have a passport. What about your job? But it's July. It's a coincidence. No... I can just tell. I think he's having an affair. Larry brought me flowers last night. I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect? Well, guess what?... It isn't. Not for you, not for anybody. People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive. It's not settling, Faith, it's life. Real life. Let me tell you something about love. There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers. Love is hard work. But one day you wake up and realize you've been had. Of course life isn't like the movies. That's why there are movies. That's the problem. When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies. Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap. Turn. But what? I think it was sweet of him to pick it out. Come on, it's not so bad. Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love. He begged me to marry him. I didn't even want to marry him. If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him? Why don't you ask him? "Thrills"? That's what you're waiting for? You know how long that lasts? Besides, how do you know? Have you ever been out with him? You don't have any idea? What's he do? So?... Is he gay? Is he married? Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry. And I did say I'd try to pick something up. No, Faith. They came out of somebody's imagination. So, what's your point? Yes. You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies. I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime. It's a metaphor. It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them. And instead wind up with nothing. So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I. But we work it out. We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other. I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome. Oh. How about that guy at the bank? How about the other one? His friend. What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name? You're an accountant for cryin' out loud. I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it... Is Larry here? That's exactly what you are. Giovanni. But I do want to. No, you don't understand. It's been wonderful meeting you. But... I have a husband. I have two kids at camp. I have a life I have to go back to. Giovanni, I want to thank you. How old are you? Oh. I'd love to. Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter. A porco? My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is. Can you tell us what she's saying? No. Well, I don't know. Well, maybe. Later. Kate. And you didn't tell her? She what?! Faith. Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley. He missed me. Larry, you've got to tell her. Went to high school with him. But... Are you saying you just made the whole thing up? The guy never even existed? What? You know him? You said it differently then. Don't call me doll, Larry. I hate it when you call me doll. Sociologist. And because. Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners. They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money. Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation. No. Right. No, why? You miss me?... Sorry... Oh, it's you. It's only Peter. That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years? Ten billion to one. That's really romantic. Mania. Good strategy. She went out to check into skywriting. I can't believe you lied. Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid? She's not here.
