Please.  Let me go. Keep it away from me. Please... please... What are you going to do? Say the word. Look, maybe we should think this over. So he took a child. He'll kill her. No he won't. Come and join us. Don't be afraid. I'm not... want to see? He's going to kill us all... Where did Swann go? Fuck! What have you done to him? Quickly! Is it finished? Dead? What now? How'd you spell that again? D'Amour. Isn't that French for something? For love, right? That's so cool. Coffee, Mrs. Swann? Thank you. Where's Mr. Swann? In his study. He got something on his mind? Why? Bad mood today. Hey... Bad show last night? ... they believe you. Sure. Oh God. Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral? Valentin? You saw this? I want you to find this man D'Amour for me. I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered. Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards. I think we make our own futures. I don't exactly know.  Philip doesn't like to talk about the past. He's a secretive man. We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do. We haven't slept in the same bed for years. We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive. You don't believe me. No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money, Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour? Harry. That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards.  And stop it from happening. Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him. I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight? I'm glad you could make it. You haven't seen anything yet. This is the new illusion. No. . . I've got to get to him! Swann... I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him. I don't know where you'd start. They won't tell you anything. Yes.  I think you probably can. We'd need to talk about your fee. ... I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards... Harry... I know it's late. How did it go today? They were jealous of him. He... didn't have me..  I told you- That's my business. Harry. Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name. It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go. Yes.  You do that. Have we met before? Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things, Maybe... I... don't... I knew Swann. He's a fucking liar. He said he knew how to protect us.  But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with. I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me.  He'll find me. I told you.  I don't -- God no!  Oh God no! Calm down! He's not going to get me! He's not!  He's not! Nix! Nix! Yes! Yes! No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out! I'll take care of her now. Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour! Who is it? No word from D'Amour? Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel. This is the way he wanted it... no autopsy, no embalming. Nobody meddling with his body... Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free. Why did you come back? What did you find? Oh Christ. It was more than that, I think. Swann said he could do stuff, yes. He could get into people's heads.  Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate.  Juggle fire. Some or it. I told you -- No. I wasn't. I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it. Shit! No it isn't.  You can't help me. Nothing? I was so afraid. Are you sure? I know.  I'm the one who shot him. I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him. Yes. And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them. What was that? Harry?  Wait! It's him!  It's Nix! Oh my God! Who in God's name are you? Are you all right? Harry? What about me? Who's there? Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face? Why did you wait so long? And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years? What is he? Listen.  You've got everything you want.  You don't need me. .. Christ in Heaven. Oh God! I don't know where he is. Show us. Puritan. Why?  Why? Oh God! You can't. Help me. Harry... It's not real, Harry- Harry.  Listen to me. Whatever's good between us, believe it. I'm here, Harry. Yes. Don't look. Harry? Oh my God. Harry! Is it finished? Come on... Harry-?
