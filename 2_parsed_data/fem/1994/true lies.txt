Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time. Helen! It's your mystery man. Then you better do something to jumpstart that man's motor. You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion. Girlfriend, you got a man. You just have to take control . . . set up the right mood. I'm shocked. So I guess you didn't get away for the weekend after all?I have a book report. I'm done. Where are you going? It is true! He doesn't know anything about me. He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something. As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine. But it's not fine. Nothing's fine. Mom, wake up! Dad barely knows we exist. Out. If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie. Dad. You just think you know everything, don't you? Unbelievable! Trent told me he wrote it. He's history. Dad, how come you know the words? Why? So I can wind up like you? What's the point? Yeah, right. Fine. I'm not a pumpkin! Okay?!! Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad... Okay, Dad. Yeah, Dad. Great! You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter. He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.Will you shutup. I should never have told you about him. Can you cover me for an hour? Simon? Ohmygod. Harry only has two moods: busy... and asleep. You bitch. Yeah. You know Harry. Are you kidding? Harry had to go out of town. I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything. He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out. But he acts like he's curing cancer or something. Where are you off to young lady? Out. Dinner's in the warmer. Tell your father I may be late. That's not true, honey-- No you're not. You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake! Where are you going? Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time. And I have to get home to my family. My husband is a good man. I wasn't cheating! No! Never! I don't know. I guess... I wanted to see what would happen. I should have gone to the police, I suppose. Not yet. But we'll find him. ... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce. He looked like such a dope. Oh shit. What are you going to do? If we're on an island, why are they using trucks? As much as you used to? Do you still love me? Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again. Harry... snap out of it! What is it? Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry? Did you pork her Harry? What about Juno? My God. Have you had to... have sex with other women in the line of duty? Are we going to die? Is it working yet? It makes you tell the truth? What did he give you? Don't call me honey! You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?! You pig! Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Then where did I get this? Harry, what's the matter with you? Tell them the truth. We're married, we have a daughter-- What were you doing there? Harry, be quiet. Let me handle this. He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right? I'm not wearing any. Allison is sick in bed. I have to go over there, honey. What? Oh, the flat tire? Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there. Natasha? I can do it! I think so. My husband can't know about this. What do you think? Of course yes! What's involved? Oh, gee thanks. Mmmm, let me see-- I love him. I have always loved him and I will always love him. Can I go home, please? Yes. What? Let me out of her! Right now! No. I needed to feel alive. I wanted to do something... outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed. To be trusted. To be special. I don't know. I guess I needed something... Yes. He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife. That's none of your goddamn business! What kind of questions are these? Yeah. I suppose he is. Harry? What can I say about Harry? He's a sales rep for a computer company. Well, maybe a little. No. He needed my help. Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park. I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon... or whatever his name is... a couple of weeks ago. I barely know him. I can't, honey. I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry. Oh, sure. Fine. I'll get some more gravy. Yeah. It was a rush thing. They needed some documents down at the court house. I barely made it. They must've just missed me. My husband the hero. It sounds wild. So now you're a big hero, right? For fixing their system. What'd you do, honey? I'll just be a second. So what happened tonight at the office? Yeah. It was great. It's okay, don't bother, Harry. Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that you'll be home at eight. I don't want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise? I need you to talk to Dana. The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon. I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks. It's not okay. It's extortion. That's fabulous Harry. How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous? Me too. Okay. Hi, honey. How was the flight? Go ahead. Uh... well, okay then. You sound terrible. I'll run out right now. Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy. Sure, no problem. Bye. What? He said he was an American agent. Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary. Fuck you. Something you obviously have a hard time doing! What's going on, Harry? No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years-- Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep. I'm Helen Tasker. Harry's my husband. And you are? I just glances inside. Helen. It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I-- I don't know. I have to think... We're going to Paris? I'm married! What is it you need me to do? What's happened? You'll call me then? What is it you want me to do? And you chased one? Were they trying to kill you? Right, of course. I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night. You can trust me completely. Tell me what happened? That was you?! Yes. Worse than Cairo? Where were you? On a... uh, mission? I understand. I kept looking back, like you taught me. I didn't see anyone. Yes. I suppose so. Where? Yes. Go ahead. Hello?Yes, sir. Yes sir. Ten, Mr. Gibson.This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was. Why? So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?! Faisil. You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
