No, don't! I feel nauseous. You two better quit it. It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know? And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work. I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me. Awww. That was so cute. You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been. I'll try to manage. Such a sordid state of affair. You're kidding. Why aren't there any lights? Can I use the bathroom? God, isn't he great? So where is he? Dick. A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try. You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite. You can hold me down. What can I say? He does weird things to me. She said not to come home until graduation. You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching? You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in. Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter. Oh God... I can't believe this! I feel faint... I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick! This isn't fucking funny, Dante! Stop this. This isn't funny. We didn't just have sex in the bathroom? Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal? And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so... God! That was so great! When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything. Promise me it'll always be like that. Do you always talk weird after you violate women? How'd you get here so fast? I'm easy, but I'm not that easy. See you later, handsome. Well, me I guess. So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you. You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang. Where'd he go? I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog. I can already tell this isn't going to work. You're such an asshole. I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again. And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you. He's not invited. Sang. Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words. How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date? The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before. You mean, on a date? I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens. The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date. You work in a market, all right. It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it. You're serious. You want to date again. I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that. Good. Stay in that frame of mind. I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years. If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major? Look how full of yourself you are. You don't have anything to do with it. Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean? I just told you. Stop it. He's a nice guy. I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff. I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway... I'm giving him his ring back. No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people. The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you. I love a macho faï¿½ade. It's such a turn-on. What smells like shoe polish? Was I right? Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck. The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged. No. Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones. I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby. Well... kind of, sort of? I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month... I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up. I'm not pregnant. It's not what you think. You saw it? You're just going to lock the store like that? Train. It took eight hours. I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris. Dante. You've got a customer. Just now.Did he say "making fuck?" That doesn't sound metal. What did he say? No way! He only speaks Russian? No way. He's your cousin? Scumbag. What are you doing?Does he sing in English or Russian? He really wants to play metal? Is he staying here? What part of Russia?I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class. I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room. Caitlin used to talk about him all the time. Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once. I'm her sister. You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with... He's got those love handles. I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops. Just the paper. Are you open? Sure. How about the beach? That's sick, Dante. She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm. Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big... Oh my God! You're Rick Derris? To an Asian design major. You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you! Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too. That's tight. Solid. No way! My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy. I don't know. I can't really tell from here.Fuck you. And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless. Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for! I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't. You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more? You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine! The slut is yours! Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her? I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now! And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys! You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks! If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back! Good. I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne. Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee? Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class. You couldn't get these shutters open? Thank you for being rational. The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it... And that made you feel better? What did he say? You had to tell him. I'm glad you've calmed down a bit. Hi, Randal. Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne. Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch. Goodbye, Dante. I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational. I love you. Don't feel sick. Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved. ...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead! But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me! Yeah, I went down on a few guys... Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys! I'm going to class. Um. Thirty-seven. Lower your voice! Something like thirty-six. All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked. Let it go... Dante... Please calm down. I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood. Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people. We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around. That's because I never had sex with him! Yeah. How do you think I know he liked... I'm serious... Sylvan? No; I snowballed him. Why do you say that? He gets off on it. After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing. Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing. Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes. It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school. To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment. I want you to come with me on Monday. After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big. Vegetable meaning paraplegic. I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes. John Franson and Rob Stanslyk. You! I'm not the pig you are. Three including you. Three. Do you know how many different men I've had sex with? You're a pig. You've slept with twelve different girls? It better be up to and including me. We might have; I don't remember. How many? How many girls have you slept with? How many? You were making a generalization about "broads!" I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life. I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough. And I actually date you? Oh, you think so? How flattering. "Be there?" You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you? Typically male point of view. I was kidding. Ooh! Can we?! Do you think anyone can see us down here? Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish? How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take? You're trusting. How much money did you leave up there? She called you, didn't she? Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive? What were you doing? What were you doing up so late? You look bushed. What time did you get to bed? You're kidding. Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here? Why did you agree to come in then? Don't you have a hockey game at two? I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something. All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave. Then quit. You should be going to school anyway... At least they weren't lit. All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard? I'm going to have a word with that asshole. After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut! No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it! He has his friend do it for him! I'm not sad. I... I don't know what to say. And... he told you all of this? Bye That was Snowball. I will. Take it easy. I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends. No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. No, I'm just visiting my man. Dante, this is Willam Black. This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend. Willam!
