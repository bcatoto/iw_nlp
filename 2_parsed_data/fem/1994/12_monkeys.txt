James Cole.  Cleared from quarantine. Yes? Whaaaaat?  "Voice mail"!  I don't know what you're talkin' about. ... Is this a joke?  I don't know any scientists. James who?  Never heard of you! You were great. The reservation's at nine thirty -- it's getting late. It's just as I told you -- my husband and I had gone ahead -- she never showed.  That's totally unlike her! Um...Acura...'92 Acura. ... Also, that cat's starving!  She would never neglect her cat! Did you take the sedative? Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that. We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West. Might be tight. On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor. Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning. Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta the zoo last night.  Then they locked up this big shot scientist in one of the cages. Scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it! Now they got animals all over the place.  Buncha zebras shut down the thruway 'bout an hour ago and some kinda thing called an "e-mu" it's got traffic blocked for miles over on 22. You can hear it on the radio all the stations... In the meantime, numerous animal rights activists have joined the chorus condemning what they're calling the "loose canon" activities of Jeffrey Mason and his Army of the Twelve Monkeys. Can these fools seriously believe that releasing a captive animal into an urban environment is being compassionate to the animal?  It's mindlessly cruel, almost as indefensible as holding the animal in captivity in the first place.
