Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you. "Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's  been ten years? Where are you now...? ...Are you guiding an Outward Bound  canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or  perhaps in charge of appearances for  the NFL like Leslie Gunther....? ...Could it be that you're like Chip  Longfellow, at the trade-relations  tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser  owns a cheese shop...! ...Looking at yearbooks and pictures  evokes so many memories...! ...Some good. Some bad. But all  interesting... ...As a graduate of the class of  1984, you are someone special... ...Whenever news of you filters back,  the school is excited and proud of  your accomplishments... ...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared  you well to lead the kind of life  that makes an impact on the world... ...Remember, "there's no where you  can go that you haven't learned how  to go in time... It's easy..." ...So come on back to the old oak  tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion  committee." This? It's from one of those P.O. Boxes.  How was the trip? All of it? That's going to cost. They're not happy, sir. They say their friend was suppose to  have a heart attack and die in his  sleep. They blame you for the compromise. In Detroit. This weekend. They were very upset. Intractable, sir. You leave tonight. And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about  this one.... I liquidated the last account in  Zurich, and split it into two new  ones in Estonia. Mmm, not really. But you're gonna  love this one. Enough? But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be  so easy. Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's  a full dossier. Very comprehensive. You should get going.... Don't forget your identity. Meow. Meow! Meow. --this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the  time. Oldies from the eighties. It's  a cold summer day in Grosse Pointe-- --and I'm ready for some good tunes  and angry talk. Or angry tunes and  good talk-- --Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau  Twins and get over the goo-angry- talking music. As you know-- --for some moments in life there are  no words, and a little nonsense now  and then is relished by the wisest  man-- --The Cocteau Twins, though also a  band of the nineties, will be aired  due to the fact that they created  their own language to sing by-- --Now that's freedom-- --The best I can do is a rhyme: Where  are all the good men dead? In the  heart or in the head? Back later.... Mary, your son's here. I bought a new rug. What's a revival tent? Marlin Perkins and Jim! His assistant. He acted like Marlin's  son, only he wasn't. At least they  never said he was... I bet they were  lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers.  Wild Kingdom my ass! I spoke to your father the other  day. Nature made him then broke the mold. Yes, they give me headaches. I have  a headache. I have a headache. You have a  headache? You don't have a headache. I have a  headache. We had a good laugh, didn't we? Why don't you return this car and  borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to  the rent-a-car so you can get a ride  back. Of course you will. Take care of her. She's a keeper. And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro  on foreign exchange? Separate the wheat from the chaff  and you've got the candle cat. Remember no matter how impossible  your problems feel. I've known people  without a chance in the world. And  all of a sudden, they have lives.   Time allows miracles. Let yourself  breathe, son. "What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/  What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/  Hey! Look out!  You're gonna hurt  someone,/ with that old shotgun,/  Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/  We really mean it!" Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's  your name? WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time.  Oldies from the eighties. That was  ah... the Specials. Doing... one of  their songs... ...and here's another. I just play my own collection. Since you stood me up on prom night  and vanished without saying a word? Well, let me see... they tore down  the George Orwell monument and put  up a bust of George Michael. Main  Street's a four-laner, no left turns  four to seven. I was married and  divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now  officially the new sister city to  Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have  fiber-optic town meetings every two  months. Those are the headlines. Hold that thought. WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl,  all the... No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years. Tell me about yourself. That's it? What's your business? Professional killer. Do you get dental  with that? Okay. A man comes to you. He is from the  past bringing you pain long since  put behind you. He says peculiar  things and leaves abruptly. It all  comes flooding back... It felt like an apparition, or some  cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time  warp I'd been thrust back into without  warning. There's a strangeness in  the air and I don't mind telling  you, I'm a little spooked. He was a  man from my past. A man I loved. A  man who disappeared. A man who's walking back into the  station. Sit. All right mystery man. I want some  answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84.  Two young lovers with frightening  natural chemistry. The girl sits in  a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at  her father's house waiting for the  most romantic night of her young  life. The boy never shows up, until  now. So, what's the question? More like what happened? What  happened, Mr. Blank? --Torn down in the name of convenience-- Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty? Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade  later, and you want to sort things  out with me. The question now is, do  I allow you... access... to my being? All right then. Would you like to  share any more deeply personal  thoughts with our listening audience  before we go to our phone poll and  see how the folks in radioland come  down on this one? Should a broken-hearted girl give a  guy a second chance at love.... I think this young man has avoided  the question completely. Has not  discussed "what happened" nor if  he's sorry for what he has done.  Therefore, I don't see any reason  why you should see him until he fully  discloses his intentions and feelings. Thank you caller. You're on the air. Yes. Next caller. Thank you. Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you  loud and clear: "If you love something  set it free. If it comes back to you  it's, well... ...Broken...." No. I'm not going. Is that why you're  here? Well, you'll have a ball. You seem  to have everything everybody wants  when they go back. The car, the suit,  the watch. The look. That just leaves  the little things, like happiness,  character, point of view... Yep. Okay. Let's catch up. You go first. I'm sure you've done worthwhile things  in the last ten years. You've had  experiences. You met people. Watched television? Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It  sounds like you need a Shockabuku. It's a swift spiritual kick to the  head that alters your reality forever. What do you want? Let me get this straight, are you  asking me out? Unbelievable. I'll think about it. Thanks, Monty. Hey there, how'd it go? This is not good. What's it look like? You haven't looked at the dossier. You have. I have to call the client and give  them a reason why you're late. I'll call them and tell them you're  taking your time. Being a  professional. Will do. Are you there? Pick me up at my father's house at  around seven. And don't be late this  time. Hello...? You're fucking psycho. Flowers. That's funny. Here. Let me put these in some rubbing  alcohol. Okay... Hold on... ...Let me get my coat. Okay I think they'll probably have booze  there. Okay... What? Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph. Debi Newberry. Marty, you haven't changed a bit! We had pictures put on, that way  everybody knows who everybody was! So, what are you doing now? Isn't it cute. It's so everybody  knows who everybody was! No-- We haven't seen each other since  high school. I don't know, Martin. It sounds like  you're feeling compromised. Live the  way you want. The only thing that's  inexcusable, to me, is cynicism.  That's the biggest cop-out there is. But wait. I still don't understand  what you do. You do not. You don't... Oh... really? What do you do? You do not. You're so funny... --Stop it-- --No. I'm teaching art at Cedar Junior  High School. I'm going over to play some tunes. Which would you rather...? Soft. I'll take the junkie otter,  clearly! I'd let the little beast  scratch and claw all he wants...  Okay. Would you rather make love to  the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller-- It's just a game...! Alright. Candied  Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest  across the desert with a fully  digested crab apple in your mouth? No time. Marty! Debi! How are you! So many  people came, but I never expected to  see you Marty. Or you Debi... I  mean... because of what your  divorce... I didn't mean to say that.  I just meant you look so good. Thank you. Do you think you could play "Too  Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo? Stacey, why don't you come up here  and take over for a little while? I'd love to. Everybody thinks they know me now  that I'm divorced. It's time to see you in private. Like heroin? Like love? I'll accept that. Follow me. I'll be right back.... He was trying to kill you, right! Not the other way around...? Is it something you've done? Get the fuck outta here. You're a government spook? Jesus Christ! Okay. Great, Martin, that's just  great. Meaning to life... Mmm.... Let me help you along, Martin. You're  a sociopath! You never could have kept this from  me. That's probably a good idea. I'm staying here. I'll hide. You don't get to have me. You are a  monster, I'm a human being. We're  not going to mate. That's because I speak human, and  you speak monster. I'm bringing down the office now. Uh... why? All right!! This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry  cause that's what it does. Bringing  you New Ones for the Nineties, a  fresh new format designed to pull  you out of what's come before, and  reel you into what's coming soon-- I tell you what's coming soon for  me, or at least what I dreamed this  morning in that weird time just before  you actually wake up. But first this  commercial. Back after this... Don't miss the show of the season at  Bilkin Community Center! "Brigadoon!"  A musical for all ages! "Brigadoon,"  starring Carol Plummer, Thomas  Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee  Ordman!... RFN... Hey out there... Okay... I'm going  to finish up that fantasy later.  First I'll give you an hour of nonstop  music... If I don't come back on  after that-- well, nevermind. This will never work out. You kill people. Other people can't.
