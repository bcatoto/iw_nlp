Old fool! Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you! Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side? Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you? Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you. I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty. What sacrifice do you want from me? I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me. As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you. But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself. I did not know that one kiss could matter so much. Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love! God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter. Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes. Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead. And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it. My husband has convinced me of the contrary. Our abstinence makes our love immortal. If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more. But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires. Always, my dear one, never any further. Love is a child to be pacified with trifles. A full diet can only kill it. Poor man. And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end? You will do as you please. It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other. Do you not agree? And if she does not choose to show you some kindness? Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are? But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer. The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me. To make me wretched in two weeks. You want my heart? How so? A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws. It is only too possible. Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last. But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune. Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate? If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself. If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it. Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more. I could value only someone whom I loved. That man has, perhaps, not yet been born. Not one. Not even that. Never. No.Monster! Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop. But I'll have my revenge, I will! Roddy, will you see me insulted? Jump twenty feet! You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes -- What, with me on the pillion? Would you kill poor me? Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side. But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London. It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter. Oh! I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner. Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world. I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man. He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him? I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set. Why are you shaking? Then you must get it. Agreed.You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver. That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins. But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...? That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me. Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees... Oh, I am grateful to you, sir. I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin. My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."The gentleman has nothing contraband. As you please. Your honor must lower his voice. I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not. You are going to drive to the frontier. I will let down the steps for your honor.What'll I tell the kids? I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit. You going to be all right? Home... New York? Can you do that? Thank you. Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news. It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again. It's three feet deep, Martin He's sitting in it. Mikey loves his birthday present. Can you stand something to eat? You're very tight, y'know? Right there. Hey Chief. Bring my cup back. Be careful. Older, sillier. I think they make you look sexy. Don't forget these. Don't be silly -ï¿½ You're going to make summer better for them... You want to go through those? I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes. I never hear the whistle. Like you're from N'Yawk. In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' Do you see the kids? 'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs. Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it. I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat? Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them. Is that a boat? You're leaving? You love sharks? My husband tells me you're in sharks. Would you like something? Some coffee? So would I. Come on in.Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me. Was he nice to you? Hi. Want a drink? So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change. Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc... ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out. ...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?But where are you going? Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you. I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell. A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just... ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me... Great! Go back to your files. Bye. Well? Supper at my place? Anything wrong? Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm. Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper? No. Dotty's the last. Another kiss? Kiss, kiss? Do I get a kiss? OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you. Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.Jesus! With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home. OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself. C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny. No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so. Hi. He'll be really mad. He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors. I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK? I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK? Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this. Nick, you're so strange... You say something? I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know. Can I call you at the office?If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that. Don't let 'em off the ground. They jet's comin' out. But don't let 'em off the ground. Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is! Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene? Gene -- you smilin'?Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal. I couldn't get a baby sitter. Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever. You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear. I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat. Like I can't stand you being a bank robber. I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny? ...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me. Can you imagine, marrying another man? Did I do something to make you do that? Did I ever turn you down, or anything? The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places! And I let myself get fat. See? You're screaming with the language and all! A person can't communicate with you. You become a stranger in your own home... I blame myself, Sonny. I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me. And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids. It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it! Yellin' at me in front of all those people. Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never. I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river. They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors. Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you. I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you. Hey, Sonny! I'm watchin' it on TV!Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry... Well, how'll I get home? Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery. Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.I love you. Oh, yeah, I will... Yeah. A lot of guns. What guns? Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken. The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef. The bottles are in the fridge. He says he doesn't know. Why don't you cook whatever's there?No, that's all. Yeah. No, not until after they killed him. Oh, a long time. Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be? He wasn't around here. I thought maybe he was in prison or some place. It was on the TV.Hey. It's raining. Ah, Sonny! Good luck, you know? I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit. My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay. I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific. She'll take good care of him. I told you, he's got diabetes. Hey, girls -- I was on television... Howard! Yes... You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house. You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it? You're serious! My body? What for? For God's sake! As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay? Pure? You don't want cancer? You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer. Gimme the cigarette. You stopped? Why? Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked? Goodbye, honey. Wish us luck! Here's your document, Sonny. Sonny - Here's your document. They're beautiful ... He's got diabetes. He's not a well person. What is it? Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan. It's all a whim. 'Rob a bank! What not?' I forgot she's in here. Oh - Maria! It's not a joke. I got this terrible fear of being locked in... Listen, I'll never make it. I'll have to go to the toilet. Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language. I am.No. This really pissed him off, Sonny. He says you're dead. He says he doesn't have a son. No! Maybe... Oh. Run. What'll you do? Come out. I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right. The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway? You got two kids on welfare now. What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare? If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her. Since then, forget it. Did I say a thing against her? God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt. What's wrong with that? The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him. Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life. Oh my God! I don't understand. If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me? Everything I got is yours. I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings. It's yours. You know it. He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria? I said you were never a faggot. Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this. I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems... I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay. My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here! On all 3 networks!Well, how did you become king, then? Well, I didn't vote for you. Order, eh -- who does he think he is? We don't have a lord. No one live there. Who are the Britons? King of the WHO? Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ... Oh! how d'you do?Back to your bed! At once! Please ... we are doctors. We must examine you. Well, what seems to be the trouble?When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled. Bravely ran away, away. Brave Sir Robin ran away. He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ... Brave, Sir Rob ...You're so good. All those people... Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry. Barnett? You have to what? Then why are you listening to her - I don't want to listen to her sing - Barnett, please - I see. Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go. You get her those Vitamin E right away. Thank you-- Yes, I am. You remember what I said about the Vitamins. It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S. What did you say your name was? What's wrong with her. I said, I've been real tired. Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment. How did you come in here? I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually. No. We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come. You're from out of town? He's a member of our congregation. No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him. No, I don't. Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see. About three years. It just is. Yes, it is -- When I was little, in church. Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here. That's what you said before. That's unkind. Oh. Well... Older. Oh. I'm not sure. I can't. I have to go. He sighs. I have to go. Doesn't it have a name? Oh? Oh. What? Hello. I don't know who you are. Who is thin? Hello. Well...How have you been? Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you. Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville? Yes. I'm not sure. Where? Who is this? Yes. Who's this? Hello. I'm sorry but I have to go. What? Yea. What...? 0h, yes. Fifteen minutes? What? I'm not sure... Oh. Oh. I'll be there. What time? It's me. What is it? Yes. Hello.Sue was trying to get hold of you. You're kidding. Bill, he's a crazy man. President? Stop it! What! An album. What National TV...? What for? For him? Oh, no. Hello. Out. Sleeping. You're not.Bye. Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you. But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off... I've been a Little dyspeptic. Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair. Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days. Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours. He doesn1t have fungus, does he? Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus. Bet the sheets are grey. Green? Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather How are you going to pay when you get sick? Next you'll be sick. Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.' But you had to go. Oh... Well. I've been so worried, dear. where are you?Your wire Ester - she passed away. No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home. Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second. Didn't you get?... How are you? Mr. Green? How'd you get in here. Well, Mr. Green. That's good, I've never seen anything so healthy. HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.Haven's not going to talk to me. Do you know Barbara Jean? How in the world did he get shot? What is a turkey shoot. Harvard? Your brother? Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview? Do you like him? Are you a close friend of Haven's? Do you ever do any writing? And before? How long have you been with them? Well, can you tell me why? Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir? When did you start singing? Have your children been deaf since birth? Come on. Come on back to bed. Do you study at all? How long have you been together? Did it break? Do they have a show to give it to you? What? Oh. A film. Why? The architect His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks. I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi. I'm Opal. Hi.Thanks. You are just a wonderful person. Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay. Hundreds of times. Money's no object. I can do benefits You think it will? Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years. If you're serious. Being serious is real important. It's not bad. You sure do it loud. No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing. Got me an audition tonight. You bet. Don't you think they'd just love another song instead? I see. Oh, why thank you. Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.Eight-thirty in the chapel. Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...? Courtland wants to... You sound different. Is that really you? Linnea?No. Mister Harding, that is not true. Yes, Mister Harding? Yes, Mister Harding? No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open... Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements? Why? And yet you suspect her. But you have no proof. Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter? Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men. He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.' So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further? At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife... Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding? Mister Washington. Get up, Billy. Who? Tell me! Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly... I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think? You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here! You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy! Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love? What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy? Tell us about it... Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday? Yes, Billy? Mister Sefelt? Would you like to start? Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy. Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure. Good. Why don't you join us? I hope everything is settled. Welcome back. Mister McMurphy. No, it was irresponsible! Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you! You men remain seated! Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!... I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy. But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy. I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight. Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand. A vote is before the group. Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy? Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much? Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy. That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it? You must try to talk about it, Billy. Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy? Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines. Just a minute, Mister McMurphy! Go on... Certainly, Mister McMurphy. Yes, Mister McMurphy. Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly. After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast. Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast... You too, Mister McMurphy. Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day. Oh, I had them removed. On this ward? Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels. That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may... Not at all, Mister McMurphy... Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window. That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy. Yes, Mister McMurphy? Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here. Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start? Billy. Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting! Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along. Good. I'm sure we'll be friends. Is there anything else? Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented. All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time. Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us. This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet. We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients. My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren. Will you come with me, please. Mister McMurphy! Put him in Doctor Spivey's office! Please see to Mister Bromden. Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.Go with him, Rose. Go with him. Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us. It's okay, Rose. You can go with him. In there. Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are! Sock it to 'em, kid!Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy... Thank you. Of course. Mister McMurphy. Oh... I'm sure you will. This way, Mister McMurphy.No... Miss Itsu. In here, please. Please follow me. To help you relax... please... Fine, thank you. Here, please take these. Okay. How you doing?Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy... It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes... Your medicine, Mister McMurphy. Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all. Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road. Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date! Wait a minute... Wow! They're so quiet. What? Where? Are they all crazies? What? Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb. Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy? Are you a doctor? Who is he? Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here? Oh, yeah... Okay, Mack! Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we? Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you! Oh, yeah... You ol' fucker! That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy. He's dead. I thought so. Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck. Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck. Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene. Are they dangerous when they're awake? Is he one of the loonies? That! What's that? Whew! Hiya, boys!If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons. I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly. Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you? I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No! But my lips were hungry - too hungry. I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses. I hope so my darling. Maybe we could try it this way. Oh don't be so shy. Oh, I hope so my darling. But let me switch on the light. Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if... Brad... Weiss. Oh Brad. Right! Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared. This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad. Then ask the butler - or someone. Well I want to leave. But it seems so unhealthy here. Brad, please lets get out of here. Oh....Say something. Oh Brad, I'm frightened. What kind of place is this? Yes, the rain has been very heavy. Oh, Brad. Let's go back. I'm cold and I'm frightened. I'm coming with you. Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back. I'm coming with you. But where will you go? We're in the middle of nowhere. Oh... What was that bang? Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from? Gosh. That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us. They certainly take their lives in their hands. What with the weather and all. Oh Brad, I'm mad. For you. Oh Brad. Uh huh. Yes Brad. Yes. Yes. Yes. Makes you cry Makes you cry Promise you won't tell Brad. Like this - like how? It's your fault. You're to blame. I was saving myself. You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad? Well. I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles. Who's Eddie? Oh. Oh, lucky him. Are you - giving a party? You're too kind.And our World will do the Time Warp again. Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains. To take that step to the right... I thought you liked them. They liked you. Creature of the night.What're you talking about, George? Then what's the problem? Don't you like her? I thought you were in a good mood. No. I don't know, I think... Don't you think there's too much gold? Anyway, you remember Harold? Chicken salad. You're in a good mood today, George.-- think what you have time to think, Lester. Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him. -- is that what this is all about? -- is that right? You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life. We cannot go into this later. -- cause she's going to be very, very expensive. -- I hope you like Miss Shawn -- Lester. I just thought you'd like to know -- That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself. Lester, don't you think that uhh -- That's George. That you were just indulging me. Yes, but... I thought... I don't know. He's a hairdresser. Why? Maybe... why do you ask? Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser. Who? Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See? Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door. And who's Jill? She what? Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her? Right now, I just don't care. No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight. Comb my hair out later, honey. Hello, George. I mean it or I wouldn't say it. And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester. I wouldn't say so if I didn't. I hope she's all right. Is she all right? The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him. Yes. Why don't you see Lester? What about? We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house? What're you doing later? I can see that. I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now. I'm not used to that kind of treatment. George -- -- to be put in that kind of position... -- I like myself far too much, far too much. -- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position. Nummers. I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers... I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead. I don't care. I don't want to talk about it... You're late, George. I don't want to see you anymore. You're very rude... if you don't come back -- So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor. It turned out to be cancer. Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer. Gee, that's very serious... That's very serious. Who's her doctor? Does she have a pancreatic ulcer? What? Why not? Thanks a lot. You mean that girl, don't you? I thought you said you weren't going anywhere. What're you looking for? Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?Shit. God, I adore you. Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you. How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day... No. You know too many sick ladies. Then it's not your problem. Are you? Are you in love with her? Well, is she your girlfriend? Like what? You know what I'm talking about. You're rude. I mean, you're very rude. Want me to? You going to answer it? That headboard. Oh, no.Okay! Call me! Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer. Hi, George. I have to see you. Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all. But Mr. Norman said -- No? -- A wash and set.I don't know -- I've got to. I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am. I can't just let him stand by the door... God, there's Lester... What? What's that supposed to mean? Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him. It's too late... If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that... Well then what are you trying to do- You're going to kill me. That's it, then I'm leaving. Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't -- Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back -- Please, we'll have to talk later -- Lester's on his way. -- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here. -- you've got to leave. -- well you better go after her. Why? -- we are? What's wrong? Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man? Me? -- ass and legs -- -- but you never were much of a tit man -- -- very nice, very nice. Nothing. -- oh I thought you were -- -- well, if you feel like playing, go play... We're friends. -- look, you don't have to entertain me... The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it? He still having parties? Where do you want to go? I am you, you little bastard. You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I? You don't think so? I do. No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester. I don't know what gets into me. -- gee... Fuckin' A -- Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon -- -- don't you want to -- -- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you -- -- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me. He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something. That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth -- We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much. What about it? He's a director. -- what guy? -- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green... Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic? What are you talking about? Don't, don't, don't... It'll ruin everything. No! Don't! Please! You're a genius. George... You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you? You did, I know you did. You did, didn't you? Well, did you or didn't you? Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight. You know what I'm talking about. Did you? George... how about Felicia? If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you. George... There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something. Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something... No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it. It was after you, baby. After you. And what? ... he tried to... uh... make it with me. No. Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men. The shrink? Many times. Not too much, don't cut too much. It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot. What's wrong? ... I don't get it done often. She's incredible... She loves you, George. Jill's coming with us. Okay... but I want you to know one thing. I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay? You don't seem very sure. You would? Well, what do you think? Can't you do it out here? Where do you want to do this? Well, I do. Shut up, it's all right. Do you want a drink? -- What for? Honey, I'll see you later. -- Well no. It never came up. He's a very private person, actually. Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet. Jill's really great, isn't she? -- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you? Jesus... So how's Norman? -- well, more than anything else -- -- I'd like to suck his cock. You do? Sid. You must be a very important executive. That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth. -- you phony asshole -- Jackie Shawn. You know what's wrong. I don't know. Why don't you ask him? Jesus, she's my best friend. Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say. Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope. Because I don't want one. No. Here. They're Yorkies and they don't shed. Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house. Shut the door, shut the door! Fine. You're still jealous. You're lying about one thing, Lester. You and your touchy investors. Really? How about starting with tonight? That's not very logical, Lester. So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf! I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to. I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him. Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy. Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy. Steve? Who do you think I was talking to? I am? No kidding? Your own shop? I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much. Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser. Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met. The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it. Anyway, you're crazy. Fine. That's right. Poster-Kleiser. Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along? Hi, Leonard. No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything. Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was. -- He reached up and tore them. -- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there... -- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs... -- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show... Well, there was this one time -- -- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all. -- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping? What? I would say so, yes. It's been so long I don't how long? He does? What? How much? After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do. Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day? Five times a day? -- Yeah, honey... We don't think marriage is important. I thought you said things were great with George. It must be something. Well, what is it, honey? You're really a love -- you sure? Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are. You're sure you don't mind? Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side. I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you? Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful. Well, he is. No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser. Oh, honey, don't be totally naive. A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years. I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.I said you were a loser! George... George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream. Yes, yes, I did. Stop it. George, now cut this out. Please!... that's not like you. George... -- yes. I wish you'd go now. ... honest. At least you're honest with me. ... well I'm glad you told me. I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually. -- no, it'll help me, really -- -- it'll help me if you'll tell me. I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know! I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing... I just want to know, that's all. How many? Obviously there were others, weren't there? So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh? Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed. -- and take this with you. I'd like you to leave now. Yes. Yes. Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police. Let go of me. I'm very tired, George. What is. I didn't want him meeting me here. Bullshit. I don't want to fight, George. -- what? -- I'll see you later... -- go ahead. -- she's a very compulsive girl. Commercials. Ha, ha. Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here. I know, honey. I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair. I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight? What business meeting? Never mind. Where've you been? A friend dropped me off. ... Okay... What? But I never know when you're working and when you're not working! When is that, George? When is that? When? Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know. I want your feelings about it. Your advice! No, but I think they might. Egypt. Whether or not I'm going. I know but this is important. I have to make a decision. When can I talk to you? George. I already said hello. George. Okay, but how did it go at the bank? Egypt! I said I wasn't sure if I could go. Could I? Could I talk to you for a second? How did it go at the bank? Hello. They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks. George. Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated. Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually... George? Yeah. You've never even been around one. Maybe you don't even like children. But in the same house, you know, one house. Will we live together? Why am I great? Honey? Do you really mean that? I am? I am? What about me? I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life. Honey, what happened? How? What? Fine. How are you? Now, George -- George -- George, I don't -- I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream. I just... who what? They're dumb, somebody... I don't know... I've had these dumb dreams lately. I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me. I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen. Let me come, too. Please don't leave me alone. Here in the canyon. Gunshots, there were some gunshots. There were some shots. Somebody's mother. I was too old. A daytime soap opera. Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day. No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time? What did you do? Didn't you have any panties on? ... Mmm-hmmm. -- uhh-huhh... -- Yesss? C'mon. -- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have. -- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he? I think you're going to hit that car in front of us. Honey? Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It? Well yes -- you know that about George. Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time. Jackie -- I'm exaggerating. Well, you know what I mean. -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop. I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy. But you have problems? Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you? Well, it's George. Nothing. -- No. No really. Don't be silly. I guess not. George is great but I know what you mean. I know, I'm sorry. So what's your point? I'm not. Maybe I am. I am? I mean why? Who is that? -- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon. We can't really leave that poor man here alone. Johnny! Why didn't you tell me before? You're kidding. You're going? Now I didn't mean that, you rat. -- so when are you going to Egypt? Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind? -- why? Let's do that. -- Jackie really shouldn't drink -- That bastard. Well did he go in there with Jackie? George? Was he alone? Well... sure... Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party? He's a hairdresser. -- no. -- never mind. Johnny! Sort of. Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend. Well he's not exactly a friend. ... my friend doesn't like it here either. Why don't you ask for another one? Oh. thank you. Now I'm embarrassed to tell you. But why Egypt? Egypt? Thank you. -- yes, Jill. Jill. -- there's not much room -- -- I'll get in the back -- Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon. -- his car. They have it blocked. Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go. No! No. No. No. No, it's not that... No... how long did you say?I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now... I'm not kidding. No you won't. I'm coming over. You're home.Yeah. Yeah. I am not! I am not! I am not like my mother! Then what do you think? Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too? You live a phony cheap cop-out existence. You think that's funny, don't you? In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life. I never get my hair done. You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it? Don't make conversation with me. Why? Making it with my mother? Well, are you? I asked you first. Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy? See if you've been making it with my mother. C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid. C'mon, are you or aren't you? Well, are you? Are you queer? Did you hear me? Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good. Chopped liver? You're my mother's hairdresser? This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox? Hungry? She's out, but you're supposed to wait. You here to see my mother?-- took a bus. -- left my bag, didn't have no money... -- you know better... -- you shouldn't do me like that... -- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better... Otis is dead. That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due? -- Oh my yes. But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either. -- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George. What with? Yeah!Come on by. Awww -- All right, who're you with? Jill? What took you so long?
