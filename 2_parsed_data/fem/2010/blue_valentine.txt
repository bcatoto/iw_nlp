I'm sleeping! C'mon, eat, you can't be late today. Frankie takes a tiny bite and makes a sour face. Come on Frankie, use a spoon. You know how to use a spoon. Frankie! We're leaving in 15. Eat! Frankie ignores her. Alright... She pulls Frankie out of her seat and carries her under one arm to the back room. Frankie protests. Dean watches, shakes his head. He sees the computer on, Cindy's e-mail is still open. He shuts off the running water. He scans through messages from a bunch of names of people Dean doesn't know. He sweats, clicks open a return message from a real estate company - apartment now available. Look up for mommy... come on Frankie! We're gonna be late... look up. Frankie is propped up on the sink. Cindy draws cat whiskers on her cheeks. Frankie tips her head back. CINDY (softens) (cont'd) Don't blink... leopards don't blink... ...Love you. Dean pulls his head out of the window. Sorry...I'm almost done. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 5A. Yeah... I'm going to. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 6. I know I know. I should know for sure by Monday. I will. Do you want to know the sex? Oh no... She pulls the car to a stop, puts on the hazzards, takes a moment to compose herself, unbuckles her seatbelt. Gets out. ELLIPSE: A blanket covers a dead Border Collie mutt in the gutter. Cindy puts Megan's body into the back of her van. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 7A. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 8. Did I miss her? It was alright... Busy. I found Megan. Over on Urbandale... near Spur. Aren't you coming up? Dean gives a sour look and lights a cigarette. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 9A. He's an old man. Go say goodbye to Daddy. You're not going to see him until tomorrow. Jerry holds Frankie back. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 10. Come on silly. Let's go in and get dry. You don't have to. Let's just go in. Cindy leads Frankie with one hand and pulls Jerry's oxygen tank with the other. Jerry takes Frankie's free hand. Dean smokes and watches... Cindy hold the screen open with her foot and maneuver father, tank and child inside. The screen door closes. Sammy barks at Dean through the screen door. He tugs his smoke, memories flood. He drifts... What are we going to tell her? She would have wanted to say goodbye. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 16. What are you doing? You're crazy. Bobby Ontario? That's a strange question to ask someone you haven't seen in forever. Yes. Yes...I haven't. I mean I have...I have been...Why are you looking at me like that? Oh OK. Who's this? Wow... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 19. I know... There is an uncomfortable silence between them. Cindy starts to unload her purchases. I'm really happy for you. She's good. Pause. They speak at the same time. They stop. Cindy concedes. You go... Oh... I was going to say, you ask her what kind of hair she's got and she says, a bob. It's pretty funny. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 20. Frankie. Fumbling, she starts bagging her groceries. Oh...I'm sorry. Cindy searches her wallet, goes into her change purse. How much was the vodka? The Checker looks at the receipt. Can I put that back? I'm sorry... Bobby holds out a twenty dollar bill. Nothankyou. Just take it off please. Bobby drops the bill on the scanner. Let's go. Isn't it funny how you can be driving for 20 minutes and it feels like you've only been driving for 20 seconds. The time just gets swallowed up somewhere... Dean places his hand on Cindy's hand that rests on the car seat. A small squeeze. She squeezes back. Dean looks at her with tenderness. Her eyes are on the road. She lifts her hand to the wheel. Dean reaches for the radio. I was kind of enjoying the silence. Think so. There should be some fig newtons back there. Dean unbuckles his seatbelt, crawls to the back of the van digs through the bags. Cindy can't see out of the rear-view. You have to look. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 23. I have to pee. The car stops on the shoulder of the two lane highway. Cindy gets out of the car. I gotta go. Cindy jogs across the road. Dean sees traffic coming. ...Hello? She stands up and zips up her pants. Eyes search the shadows. ...Cindy is ALONE. A leaf falls to earth. She stares at it and her mind drifts back to... Research. Quads can't use their arms. I'm a paraplegic. I can't. I have to go get gramma. Cindy rolls the wheelchair back. Get down Napoleon! Get down! GLENDA HELLER - 50's, desperate - peeks her head out of the kitchen. She holds a coffee mug filled with gin on the rocks. Ope - I thought you were your Dad. Just us. Cindy kisses her mom on the cheek, can smell the alcohol. How was the beauty shop? It's OK mom. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 26. Can I have your plate Dad? He pushes it across the table an inch. Glenda lowers a slice onto Jerry's plate with a SPLAT. Jerry looks at his dinner. Glenda serves herself. Cindy cuts Gramma's meat with her fork and looks over at her dad. His face is turning beat-red... Suddenly, Jerry pounds his fist into the mound of meatloaf, obliterating it. Particles of ground meat fly everywhere. Glenda won't look up, her shoulders tremble. Jerry raises his steaming fist. Bits of ground beef stick to his knuckles. They had it ready-made in the deli. I... thought it looked good. I thought it would be nice. ...for a change... Sorry. Do you want me to make you some eggs? It's not bad. Oh bullshit. Glenda retreats into the kitchen. Gramma and Cindy eat. Shit! Give em! Cindy presses her lips together. She leaps at Bobby and squeezes his crotch and gets her underwear back. Bobby's face turns vicious. He snatches them back aggressively. Take a deep whiff, you fucking douchebag! She tears off his necklace, throws it at him, slams the door. It looks like you have a new neighbor. Cindy returns to the book, but there is something about the mover that has captured her attention. She can't stop watching him every time he passes her door. No, Gramma, you're in bed now. It's bedtime. Do you want me to keep reading? Gramma nods. Cindy turns the page, looks up, sees Dean lift the old man over the threshold and into the room. Okay, shhh. But you gotta be quiet. Cindy gets up and opens the window. She turns on the fan, digs in Gramma's purse, gets a cigarette and a lighter. Cindy walks to her gramma's door, sees Curtis walking away from the old man's room. No. Like what? Are you trying to pick up on me? ...it's just Dean... he's losing his hair. What are you guys doing? Did Pa make you something to eat yet? ...Frankie? ...What'd you and Pa eat? ...Was it cooked all the way through? No pink in there? ... Dean walks up from behind, putting on a clean, white T-shirt. He snaps his fingers at Cindy. Cindy swipes his hand away with more force than necessary. Okay sweetheart, your daddy wants to talk  to you. I love you... love you... Don't forget to brush your teeth tonight okay. Okay? Here's your dad. Cindy sets down the receiver and walks away. Dean snacks on tortilla chips and picks up the phone. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 33. What does it look like I'm doing? It's fine. Fine! Close the door! Dean closes the door, remains in the BATHROOM, watches his naked wife, removes his clothes. Cindy does a double take. What are you doing? Dean pulls back the shower curtain and steps in. Dean. The small shower presses them close. Dean's smile infects her. He leans over, they kiss. Brushing lips at first. Dean presses closer. Cindy pulls back and pivots him around until the stream of water catches his body. He leans his head back, the water pours over his hair and face. He places his hands on Cindy's hips and pulls her close to him. Cindy hands him a bar of soap. He builds a gentle lather. Cindy inches back, turns around. Dean lathers her back, slow and languid. What do you remember? Okay. Cindy grabs under his armpits. He refuses, but she wins. She pivots them around again. Standing in the stream of water, Cindy washes the soap off her body, eyes closed, head back. Dean reaches for her and follows with his fingertips the flow of water down the front of her body. Give me the soap. She forms a quick lather in her hands. She rubs it into his chest, her strong hands making circles of suds. Dean is a tranquil participant. She lifts up his left arm, scrubs his armpit, then his right. Her hands build a lather and wash his penis. Dean catches his breath. Turn around. Dean obeys. She continues wash his back, buttocks and legs and stops. Dean turns around to Cindy who holds a squirt of shampoo in her hands. She reaches up and scours his head. Your hair is not falling out. Cindy pivots him around into the water and rinses him. You're crazy you know... Okay, get out. I have to finish washing myself. No. Go order dinner. I'm hungry. Grump. Grump.  She makes 2 drinks - vodka on the rocks. She hands Dean his drink. Why don't you put some music on Dean? She pecks him on the cheek, walks to the bedroom to change. Hi. I think he passed away. Dean feels for the locket around his neck. He shakes his head. She was pretty too.. Dean thinks about the old man. The bus drives. Why do you say that? Excuse me? Home. The bus slows. She gets up to leave. Doors open. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 42A. We passed it. Back there... Dean looks back. He sees a bunch of houses that all look the same. They keep walking. ELLIPSE: Cindy smokes one of Dean's cigarettes, calls her dad No. Books. Mostly. We'll see. I'm trying to get into med school. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 44. Someday. Don't do it. DEAN (rubbing his head) You're gonna be a good doctor. I can tell. He digs through text books, pens, a wallet, asthma inhaler. Then he comes to a bottle of lotion. Opens the cap, sniffs. You wanna put on my lotion? Dean nods, applies a little lotion to his fingertips, rubs it in circles on his hands, applies it to his forearms, neck, face. He enjoys the feeling of it, offers her some. She say's no. He digs through her purse and finds lip balm, smells it. Are you fucking with me? Okay enough... Because. Throughout the rest of the night Dean tries to continually steal Cindy's purse from her. It is a game. Innocent. Aren't you gonna miss your train? You are just gonna stay up all night? Here. Same streets. Same people. Everything here is the same. You walk down the street, you can't get lost... you know. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 46. There! Cindy runs to an old, creaky merry-go round, jumps on. I used to love these things. Push me. Dean is tentative, but goes along with her. He starts slow, but she eggs him to go faster. He runs in circles picking up speed until he is in a breathless, circular sprint. He can't keep up with the centrifugal force. Get on! Dean does as he's told. They both hold on for dear life. The world spins in a frenzy. The dread on Dean's face builds to insane laughter. It is super fun. Cindy screams. Her hair snaps in her face. Then, a look of sickness steals her smile away. She wants it to stop, which, slowly, it does. She gets off first, tries to walk, but is too dizzy. She just keeps falling to the ground. Dean crawls off the merry-go round on all fours, laughing. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 47. Make it stop. I'm still spinning. Maybe it's just the Earth that's spinning. We're toasting tonight? Dean makes his toast. CLINK. Dean quaffs his glass. Sometimes you don't make any sense. You might as well be speaking Chinese. Dean imitates a Chinese man - it goes on too long. Happy belated anniversary. Cindy starts to eat a spread of Indian food and booze. Good. How did Frankie sound? She didn't sound sad? Daddy's little girl. That's beautiful. Why don't you do something... I don't know... isn't there anything you want to do? Dean thinks about it. Shakes his head. I don't know... You have so many things you could do. You're good at everything. You could do anything you wanted. Like right before the bear eats the man? How different we are. You and me. It's a good thing. Absolutely. We don't have to get in each other's way. I didn't say that. What I meant is that it's important for us to have our space. That's all. We're grown people. You know, we rarely sit down and have a conversation. An adult conversation. Because every time we do, you turn something that I say around and make it mean something that I didn't mean to say. You just blab. Blab. Good luck. I just want you to think about what you say sometimes instead of saying what you think all the time. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 51. I think my glass has a hole in it. Cindy cuts around her food and pushes a piece aside. It's fat. I don't want to. You eat it.  Dean stabs a piece of fat and pops it into his mouth. That's going straight to your tits. Shiiit. I bet you a nickel you can't even beat me at arm wrestling. Ready? On the count of three... One... Two... Cindy flexes and starts. THREE! I'm alright. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 53. Ow ow ow. Dean leads her to the kitchen, holds her hand under the faucet. It stings a little. Dean tries to pick up Cindy. She struggles against it. Finally he cradles her like a squirming baby. No, no... Put me down. It's okay... Dean huffs a little. Cindy adjusts her weight, self- conscious. He hefts her down the hallway to the bedroom. I'm spinning. She sits up. They toast. Dean gulps his. Cindy takes a sip. What are you doing in there? ...Dean?! An agonizing moan comes from down the hall. Cindy staggers  off the spinning bed and stumbles to the bathroom door. Are you all right? Dean... She pushes the door but it is blocked. Dean moans louder.  Cindy pushes again and inches it open. She sticks her head  in, sees him laying on his back looking up at the ceiling. Ew. Come on, get up. What? Dean... Come on, it's time for bed. You're drunk. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 56. No... Dean... Wait a second. She removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms  underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his forehead. Stop... stop... stop... Are my hands cold? You wanna go somewhere. Where can we go? Is your roommate awake? Do you think he's gonna come out? You think he's gonna go to sleep now? They hear Jake changing channels in the other room. As quietly as possible, they have sex under the sheet. Just a second... She wraps the test in toilet paper and buries it in the trash receptacle. A moment while the door swings closed. Silence. Cindy opens the stall and confronts herself in the mirror. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 59A. Give it back! Bobby crushes the card in his fist. She tries to pry it open. She can't. She's not gonna get it back. I... I don't know... It might be... ...I'm sorry...I'm sorry... Before us. I don't know. It's not the right time. Dean looks down, pauses and looks back to Cindy. Okay... The DOCTOR wheels over to the table in the center of the room. She pulls out a clean sheet of examination table paper. Yeah. The Doctor touches Cindy's knee to spread her legs, picks up an instrument off the table. I'm a student... I'm studying to be a DOCTOR... What's that? Because... I always thought... it would be wonderful to take a sick child and... Cindy cuts herself off. The Doctor holds a hose. ...heal them... Wait... wait. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 63. Your eyes ever wide open, and you're dreaming? Cindy breathes deep & settles into him. Dean hums a lullaby. You smell like you. Shit. She drops it and rolls over. The digital clock reads 4:52... Moments later... she is on the phone. CINDY (on phone) (cont'd) Hi it's Cindy... I have this weekend off. Cindy unwraps the bandage on her hand. She presses the four vampire bites to her lips. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 64. ...Who didn't show?...Meredith again? How long can she keep doing this?... Did you try Janet?...She's your first call....I'm out of town too...Yes I know, I know all of it. Yes...It's going to take me a few hours. She hangs up, eases the door open. Dean is passed out in the middle of the hallway. She tries to wake him, but he's hibernating. She steps over his fallen body. Goodbye. No response. She closes the door behind her. You want some of this? Dean accepts the pipe and takes a monster toke, holding it in until his face turns purple. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 67. Mediplex... You are going to need to come in... We're going to need to see him... I can't diagnose over the phone... About 20- 30 minutes... Okay? ...okay, bye... Cindy hangs up. She holds a clipboard. CINDY (reading) (cont'd) Maria? A Hispanic women, MARIA GUEVARA - robust, 50's - clutches her purse and rises off a waiting area chair. Cindy smiles. Right this way. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 70. Have a seat on the table, Mrs. Guevara. Maria has a blank look. Do you speak English? Hablas Ingles? Maria holds her fingers up, indicating an inch. Small. Poquito? Si. Yo tabien. De donde eres tu? El Salvador. So...Tu famalia esta aqui? Here? No no. They're in El Salvador? Si....Yo...sola. How you say en Ingles? Sola? Uh...Sola...Alone. Si. Alone. But hopefully not lonely. Maria hides her face with her hand and lets out a self- pitying giggle. Cindy looks at her clipboard. So you're feeling some pain in your left breast. Uh...Tu dueles en tu chiche? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 71. Si Si. Well let's take a look. Cindy hands her a paper robe. Can you take off tu ropas and pongas... put this on? Okay? Comprende? Maria nods and takes the robe. Cindy turns to leave. Lo siento mi Espanol es muy mal. A woman in 215. Hispanic. 53. Lives alone. Complaining of pain in her left breast. Oh yeah? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 72. I'm married. I don't remember asking you for help. He holds up his hands and leaves Cindy alone in the hallway. She looks at the ground, turns around and walks to Room 215. What's the problem, Maria? Tu sabes? Cindy pantomimes undoing her shirt. No comprende? Necessita take off tu comisitas. Your shirt. Understand? Maria nods and undoes her blouse. Cindy turns her back. Maria sits slumped with her blouse opened. Cindy pantomimes removing her shirt fully. Maria does so and sits with her hand covering her face. Cindy gestures to her bra. Por favor, Maria. Come on. Maria unhooks her bra. A purplish cantaloupe-size abscess grows on her left breast. Cindy's covers her mouth. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. Maria... Maria puts back on her blouse. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 73. Maria! Que eso? Why didn't you come in sooner? Why did you wait this long?! Eso es muy mal. Very bad. Maria starts to cry. How could you look at yourself in the mirror and pretend it's not there? How long have you been pretending? Dr. Feinberg walks into the room. Her breast. Her breast! Dr. Feinberg takes Cindy's clipboard from her hands. It's probably been growing for years! Dr. Feinberg turns to Cindy. Ma'am you're going to have to bring him in...you have to bring him in... You need to fill that out, sir. You can go over there. Mimi returns to the phone. No, you need to fill it out, sir. Bring it back up to me when you're done. Who's your wife? Are you Dean? Dean? I can see that. How'd you get here? Frankie's fine... Dean nods. He looks over Cindy's shoulder at Mimi. We're not going to do this here. Cindy crosses the counter, grabs the bags by Dean's feet. CINDY (to Mimi) (cont'd) Give me a few minutes. I'll be right here. Don't let him brainwash you again. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 76. Live your life. Cindy walks out of the clinic hefting her bags. Help me. Dean grabs the remaining luggage and follows, throwing back a look to both Mimi and the Gang-banger. Are you drunk? Can you drive? No, you go. Take the car home. She hands him the keys. You know how many sacrifices I make every day. I never asked you to! I can't take this shit anymore. Cindy enters through the electric doors. You're right Dean, I can't take the truth...I've had it with the truth or whatever it is you make up along the way and label as truth... You win. I give up... I've been lying to you for a long time. It's me, Dean. I didn't want to hurt you. But I'm not the person you fell in love with. And you won't let me be anything but that person. That's why I can't look at you. Because every time I do I can't stop thinking about how much I want you to hate me. But you're too stupid to see it, and too chicken shit to do anything about it. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 78. I don't love you anymore... Why can't you stop loving me? He pulls back his fist and swings, hitting the metal locker behind Cindy's head. He repeats the blows with thunderous rage. Feinberg enters the room. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let me see. You son of a bitch! Punches catch him in the nose. Cindy bullies Dean backwards with repeated shoves to the chest. He backs up down the hallway. Mimi stands in the hallway. Oh my god. Call 911. I'm going to call Give me the keys. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 79. I want a divorce! She has emptied herself. Her whole body is numb and it feels as if she is floating in space. Anger overcomes Dean. He hits the dashboard with concrete fists. Oh God. Cindy squeezes by her father to Dean. The expression on her face says it all. Dean hands her the flowers, leans in and kisses her. While he's there he whispers. Are you okay? Dean nods. She leads him down the hall. Jerry stops, turns. JERRY (to Cindy) Tell him to take off his shoes. Dean removes his boots. A toe wiggles out of a holey sock. He gathers the hole and tucks it between his big toe and his second toe. Cindy leads him by the hand to the kitchen. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 81. Does that hurt. Why? They'll stop soon. Good. Cindy goes over to her stereo and turns on some music, low - it is the same song that Dean and Cindy listened to in the moon room. It drowns out some of the fighting. She approaches him, starts unbuttoning his shirt. Promise me one thing... you'll never let me become an adult. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 82. That motherfucker. She kisses his chest. Dean starts getting underneath Cindy's clothes. He places his palm on her belly. I love you too. Yeah. From here on out, their actions increase with urgency. Each moment that goes by makes them more and more desperate to feel the other's skin. They are down to their underwear when they hear a door slam downstairs. They never come in here. They make sweet love. Who had candy for breakfast? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 83. How was Frankie? I'm OK. Cindy kisses her father on the cheek, closes the screen door. DEAN (holding Frankie) I can't play right now, okay? He releases his wired daughter who runs circles around him. Dean walks up to the porch. He and Jerry stand face to face. I'm not coming home. Fear strikes Dean. He presses the base of his palms into his eyes, rubbing until he sees stars. I am thinking about her. I can't let her grow up in a home where her parents don't love each other. Let her go, Dad. Jerry releases her and Frankie runs fast to Dean. She jumps at him to go into his arms. He doesn't pick her up. From the porch Cindy and Jerry watch Dean as he points to them. Frankie doesn't move. Dean yells for her to go back. Frankie heads back to her mother, confused. Cindy kneels down and takes her in her arms. Families light fireworks off in the middle of the streets.  Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 86A. The houses form neighborhoods that join with other neighborhoods forming towns. Beyond the towns, hills stretch far into to the horizon. Fireworks explode against dark blue  on blue.  Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 87.
