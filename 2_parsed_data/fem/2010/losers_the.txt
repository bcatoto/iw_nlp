Men. How's the steak? I don't eat red meat. Slows me down. You got nice arms. Relax, slugger... I like arms. That's all. No. Think we can change that?  Wow, it's everything a girl could dream of. Got a bathroom? You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a "no" here? So what brings you to Florida? They have whole conventions devoted to air conditioners? Bet I would. Where were we? Saw me there did you? Didn't see me at the McDonald's though... I have a proposition for you... Just hear me out. I don't want to hurt you. Yes, I am. Room's on fire. Your life. Back. Max. I can help you. It's not too tough if you know where to look. You guys aren't exactly subtle. Counted the number of teeth found in the safehouse debris in Karachi. Not nearly enough for five men. That you're alive? Just me. You want Max and I can tell you how to get him. Nice try, but I'm working alone here. If I wasn't, I wouldn't need your help. Ready for the important part? There is a plane. This plane contains a truck. This truck contains a cargo. This cargo is very important.  This cargo belongs to Max. You steal the cargo, Max comes looking for it, you grab Max. Hey! (he turns back) You really think I look good in these jeans? Cargo's heroin. Max uses it to fund his off the books ops. And it comes straight from the poppy fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil. (knowing full well) Oh... does that name mean something to you? He used you to kill Fadhil and take over his operation, that's right. What did you think you were doing there in the first place? Fighting for truth and justice? Check my background. I'm an ex- Company hitter. First job was a junior field officer in Shanghai. You can Google it under Shanghai Hilton Decapitation. Two Chinese and an Italian arms dealer in Bangkok. With my hands. Then I stopped auditioning for you. This is a check for ten grand- Operational capital, that's all. (holding out the check) You've been waiting three years for a shot at this guy. You're not gonna get another. You want Max, this is it. Intel on the shipment. You check it out, you check me out, you decide - are you in or not? A moral issue. Yes. I'm sorry. Please leave... Please... you must leave... Long enough. She put a bomb in your car? Really? You can't hang out with anyone just named "Phil"? I'd expect no less. Have fun... (watching the chopper) Uh-huh... When I was a girl, I collected human ears. I had over three dozen pairs when a feral dog came into our camp one night and took them. The dog was good eating, though. Are small arms gonna be a problem? I'm giving you a chance to get even. That's all you need to know. Oh, completely. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for prayers. You know, you are a sharp one--and don't let any of these other boys tell you different. Understood and acknowledged, sir. Open the valve. It must be how he moves the drugs... Are you trying to make this more dramatic? What?  Pull out all the wires. You ever hear of a clock radio that exploded cause you unplugged it--pull out all the wires. I just saved our lives- Of course not! What about Goliath? (staring at Roque) Goliath. I have an idea... So, what really happened to you in Afghanistan? He's a bad man. Isn't that enough? When you tell me about Afghanistan? I'll tell you about Max. Why were you alone when I found you? Sick of what? And he hasn't told them he is alive? So Roque has no one. And you have... If you two really fought, he would kill you, I think. I'm almost sure of it. Because you care what happens to the others. You wouldn't put them at risk to save yourself. I know it is. Law of the jungle. Oh, yes we are... Who's calling, please? One moment, please... Oh, you just missed him by like two seconds. Can you come back in like an hour or so? Security? Who's Par-Sec? And this man you found in the basement - he was your true target? And you spoke with him? Did he beg? The man in the basement. Did he beg for his life?  Would you rather I pointed it at your head? Did you kill my father? Did you kill him? Did you kill him? Wear it. Remember him. I wanted to find and punish those responsible for my father's death. Max, his men, everyone. That and the cardio. I'm coming.
