Do you think I should be reminding them to drink enough? It's very hot out there... Beth - they're writers, not babies. You run round after `em too much. Can I tempt you, Glen? I often take something snacky down to Nicholas at this time of day. I know how the brain needs feeding. How are you settling in? Oh. We try to keep it peaceful here; far from the madding crowd. Why not? You keep saying you want to be with me. Jody and Casey are all ears. I want to be with you. I thought you'd be pleased... Are you going to tell her? How's the worker? Well give me your pages and I'll get started. Nicholas hands her several pages. Who were you talking to just then? I could come with you. For a drive. I don't know when we last went out. Buying time by biting his scone: We could go into Hadditon, get a meal. Mary's got Casey to help. You can run it by me. I'm good at forensics. Nicholas has run out of excuses. Can I tempt you, Andy? Andy takes a scone with a wide smile. That's Glen, our new academic. Turns out he's working on Thomas Hardy. Said he might have some farming questions. Would you mind? And the writers are eating al fresco tonight; could you check there's no bird shit on the seats? Sorry. Yes. Nicholas and I are going out to dinner. As she walks away, Andy glances at the shed, a look of puzzled dislike on his face. What a dump. As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette. What was it about? Did it sell? What are you working on next? Upstairs, through a window, we see Beth is putting on a blouse. Is there anything left to say about that maudlin bore? At least you've been published. I'm seething with envy; I'd love to be published. I publish myself on the internet. Oh, do you earn money doing that? No. Lesbian crime. I'm here picking up tips from the master. But I'm ready. Come on. She's on her way to join him. Oh. Who is she? The question hangs in the air. Nicholas' smile is frozen. Tell me. Who? (her voice raised) Who is she?! What's her name? Patel? She's in your book. You put her in your book! And Desert Island Discs was a year ago. Once or twice? Shhh!... Beth's pained voice drifts out of the house. How can you lie to my face? You look me in the face and LIE! You BASTARD! Don't you dare - That's from her isn't it? Are you keeping her waiting? Nicholas finally snaps. (leaving the house) Take your freedom. I can't live like this any more. It makes me feel WORTHLESS! Is she young? Liar. Glen cringes. Beth slams the door. Nicholas wipes soil off his glasses; brushes it off his shirt. He realises with a sinking heart that he must pass the writers to get to his car. I didn't know they provided material too. Beth does everything for him you types his manuscripts, deals with  his agent, makes his female  characters convincing.  Nicholas still at the door, listening. She even came up with the name Dr  Inchcombe. No wonder he's bored. I hope she takes him to the fucking  cleaners.  Nicholas walks to his car. Silence. He roars away. Will she take him back, that's the  question. Thought you weren't going to come. Where are we going? To your farm? A look of frustration crosses his face. He turns to her. But you said you wanted to be with me... Big glass of rioja please. And I need a room. Sure, how many nights? Don't know. Just one. You here on business? No. Business of a kind. I don't mean to pry; I'm just really nosey. I'm from here. Sort of. Nice place. I keep meaning to leave but... Hard to get away. My mum's house is just up the road. You're not staying with her? She's. She died. Have that on me. And here's your key. Up the stairs, right in front. You can't miss it. Didn't think I'd see you tonight. Tell me everything...  Andy shakes his head. Andy, you're just a sex object. No one'd have you. He grins back at her. Andy, come and look at Ingrid. I think she's coming into heat. She goes out. This is going rotten underneath. It's falling apart. No don't touch me, don't you dare. Glen panics, realising their reunion is going to be right by the door. He puts his hand on the flush, hoping to warn them - too late. Not good enough. Not any more. You do what you like and then you're sorry? Where were you? You drove her home? Do you think she'll get over it?... Nicholas shrugs. To Glen's horror, he starts to cry. I've got to go to the bottle bank. Yes. The goat's come into heat. I love you so much. When the hat is on, it means don't speak. Andy, you moron; it's me. Andy looks more closely. A disturbing spark of recognition. Then help me! What sort of work, graphics? You're a gardener? Andy says nothing. He stares at her nose. Glen has come in. Would you like to buy it? Yes. Andy if you want it, why don't you make me an offer? Unlucky. Tamara opens a cupboard. It's full of empty wine bottles. You stupid prick. Andy looks at her. She is sincere. You first. Fuck off. She kisses him. As they start to make love: I love you. Fuck off. I love you. Thinking of the first time we saw this place... Not wonderful enough. She starts to walk away. Nicholas holds her back. Well I'd better sort myself out then. People talk about the muscularity in  prose. I want a similar muscularity  in my verse. I don't want a poetry  that's flabby or obese - that's why I  adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes:  Diggory picks the vol-au-vent up and without looking, puts it  in his mouth. Casey moves over to Nicholas and Glen. ABB ACC DEE D. They give you the  armature, the beating heart, the  nerve ends... She's had a nose job, Dad. Poor Tamara. Such a sad girl. She used to come and help you wash the car, didn't she Nicholas? I think she liked a bit of family after her dad left. Is that Tamara Drewe who writes the column in one of the Sundays? Used to. Writes for the Independent now. She spent weeks going on about her nose job. Smart way to pay for it I suppose. Was her old one an awful conk? She's poured herself into those shorts. I hope they don't give her thrush. What's the etiquette with nose jobs? Do we mention it, or... Hello. Sorry to intrude. Hey, Tamara. Poppy, how are you? Love your new hooter. Thanks. It isn't actually new; just smaller... Tamara, so sorry about your mum. Thank you... Are you staying down for a while? I'll have to. There's so much to be done. You must let us know if we can help. Actually, I was going to ask if you could spare a pair of strong arms. I've got a skip coming tomorrow and - Nicholas? - Nicholas is opening another bottle of prosecco. It pops its cork over his trousers. He mutters a swear word. I... No. Well thank you. You're very kind... Is Andy around at all? Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers. Oh, I can't spare Andy. He's making a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons. She's had the writers down there  helping her all day. I hope she  realises they're here to work... Can't believe what a difference  her nose makes. Well I think it's a mistake; taken away all her character. Come on; she looks ten times better. And she knows it. I found those shorts really irritating. Going around with half her bum hanging out. I mean, why? To annoy people like you. Might get a pair myself. Why not? Maybe; if you did the wrinkles too. No... But it feels right. My first  novel's definitely going to be autobiographical. Ideally, I'd like to make it into  fiction before I'm thirty. What? You know before I got the nose job  I had no trouble getting taken  seriously. Maybe, when they removed  that bit of cartilage, they pulled  my brain out by mistake - what do  you think?  Glen smiles, won over. Beaky?... We see her stricken face as she turns away. Then she turns back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood. Boys know nothing.  Nicholas looks up at her, smiles indulgently. Tamara stops  work. I've been reading `Inchcombe's  Dose.' The bit where Doctor Inchcombe  finds himself having thoughts about  the dead guy's daughter.  Tamara walks around the car, bringing her polishing cloth  closer to his. You describe her light smattering  of freckles and her striking  profile. So...  She turns her head. Who did you base her on? Have you noticed me?  Nicholas looks at her in surprise. Because I've noticed you... Nicholarse. Pretty direct isn't he? He's not even bought her a coke. Andy turns. Sees her. And he stinks. That's disturbing human. I wish. Looks like I'm stuck here for a while. Actually, I've got a proposition for you. So we can reminisce about how I smashed your nose? Yes I did. I've got to do the house up before I sell it. It looks like an eighties timewarp. Would you like the job? Painting it and tidying the garden? Good hourly rate. What d'you mean? I'm fine. Jesus Christ, the goats are giving That's very sweet of you Andy - So... is that a yes? Andy doesn't reply. Come on, goat whisperer - I thought I'd be doing you a favour. I thought you needed the work. It's all over with Ingrid and Darcy. She's had a shit time but she'll still call him. He'll lose her number. He won't ring her back... Andy's face cracks into a smile. He is won over. How's Thomas Hardy? Glen unburdens himself. Oh dear. Crikey. I do a couple of sessions a week, to keep on top of it. Pretty good at forging Nick's signature. Glen looks awed - and defeated. Would you like me to read it? Be glad to. If you think it would  help.  Beth suddenly sees Andy out of the window. He's leaving. Sorry Glen. Just need Andy - If you're going into Hadditon - we're really low on chicken feed. She's got you helping her too? Andy, that sounds like a lot. I need you here. As long as you're not working for her in the hours that I pay you. What would you choose for in here? Make it.Tea bags. Sugar. Fridge.I'm off to work. Andy stares. Suddenly Tamara is no longer just a blast from the past. He sees a future - a future that he wants. He slowly smiles back - but she's already striding away. Hello. I'm Tamara Drewe. I'm supposed to be interviewing you - for the Independent. She smiles sweetly, smoothing his hair. It was scheduled for later but maybe now's a better time... Hi Boss. To indie drummers? Maybe. Who are your influences, Ben? I'm selling. D'you want it? Would you like a beer? Who? Tamara opens the fridge. Ben is inches away. He still hasn't kissed her and he's just about to. You write all the songs; that's pretty rare for a drummer. You mean you don't spontaneously combust? Oh he doesn't. In his trousers. Why won't it come for you Glen? The way you talk about it's so engaging. Who are you writing for? Who's your ideal reader? Because if you wrote the way you spoke... it would make me want to read Hardy. Yes. If you wrote like you were talking to a friend... Pass me that thing. Glen passes it, looking at Beth as she tightens a bolt. Try it now. Glen turns the key. The engine starts. Glen starts to drive the mower, delighted. Beth watches him, amused. Oh your books are far more than that. Your prose is so vivid. And Inchcombe - for all his flaws - is a man with total integrity. They need dusting with this. That's great, that's brilliant. Super. Sprig of mint on the top. I'm just starting something. Not the column. Just stuff coming out. Don't want to stop it. Coo-er... In your parents' bedroom? Still I suppose being an exhibitionist is part of his job - strutting about on stage. Very good-looking, isn't he? Poppy You-Tubed him and we both got quite hot and bothered. Is that his car - the yellow Porsche? Bit brash, vrooming through the village... But fancy our Tamara bagging a bone fide rock star. She was such an ugly duckling. She must be thrilled to bits. We're not open for another hour. I'm going to move on soon, Andy. Don't know if I can stick a winter here. The way the light disappears; it's doing me in. I'm a blue sky girl. Got to have some warmth. Andy just looks up at her, smiling his understanding. What's this? Ben... For which finger? Those girls could have aborted! Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out. Nicholas is approaching. It beats me why you people want to live in the country. You've got no sense of responsibility. It's not our dog! Oh - Nicholas... What, this old thing? (laughs, delighted) Well, I try... Can't wait for your next book. Inchcombe's such a sauce- pot. Giles is always says `What are you reading Penny? You've got steam coming out of your ears...' She laughs like a drain. Nicholas joins in. Beth is striding away with the dog, infuriated. So what's the ring saying, Ben? That you were in love with me. You're the best fun in the world. I'd love to marry you. She throws her arms around his neck. Can I say it then? I love you. Tamara holds him, profoundly affected. Something akin to fear flickers across Ben's eyes. The phone rings. Shhh! There are writers here, trying to write. Beth is in the hen enclosure, a hen in her arms. This is a Buff Orpington. She's  looking a bit peaky today. Not a  great layer but she's very  decorative.  Beth puts down the hen. We're fully organic - but I like to  think that our champion product is  the written word.  Nicholas approaches, his hand held out, heartily. Ben is engaged to Tamara. Isn't that lovely? He'd just popped the question when I rang. We're delighted for you both. He was out of control. He was chasing livestock. He could've got shot. I hope he makes her happy. It's hard for girls when their dads walk out. Gives them bad taste in men. Just saying her father left when she was a girl and - It's a shame it doesn't fit. Perhaps you should have taken one of mine with you when you went to buy it. So... when did you buy it? Was this for someone else? Ben shrugs, not wanting to admit. The truth dawns. You gave it to Fran didn't you? You asked her to marry you...? Do you? She wondered if you had a delivery date in mind. I told her Easterish. Mind that cocoa, it's hot. Across at Winnards, Tamara's bedroom light comes on. For a moment, she gazes out. Nicholas gazes back. There's a few invites; I'll pop them there. Just tick the ones you want to go to. Ben wraps his arms lovingly around Tamara. She draws the curtains as he pulls her away. And Tim wants to know if you'll do your Christmas signing in Hadditon. I know he's always ungrateful but I think it's so important to keep these little bookshops open, don't you? Come in soon, my love. Nicholas stares out into the darkness. He isn't working. He isn't doing anything. What about you, Glen? Where will you be? I'll miss our chats. Me too. We'd love to have you. Glen doesn't want Beth to move away. Oh? It's kind of research; I want to write about them. They're funny, Ben - come on. So I've got her this gorgeous Rajastani gagara skirt... Besides, I want to show you off. More like arm fungus with that face on. Ben, meet Glen. Glen, meet Ben, my fiance. Uh huh. I knew you'd be pleased. Wait. Sorry. Could you do it for Ben? He's my fiance. We're getting married in the summer. Well merry Christmas. Nicholarse. She turns away. Because... I've started writing. But this is proper. Not just stuff for the paper. 'It's about my teens - and is working for me here. Of course I'm with you... I don't know; the shed... What do you think? Really? Well then. Keep it... Andy puts the phone down, grinning. Tamara is grinning too, sharing the same memory. Really? Oh dear... Couldn't you do it another day? Hello, Judy? Beth, hello love. I'm so sorry, I think Nicholas has  got his phone turned off and um - He's right here. I'll put him on. Oh - actually - don't worry - I've  just found it.  Beth puts the phone down, biting her lip. She is relieved,  ashamed and ultimately not reassured. She looks to camera. Nicholas has been telling the truth  a lot recently.  The cake, with its question mark, is finished. `Come to Winnards Farm.' She must want a foursome. Or something. How many times? I didn't send it! Are you listening to me? BEN! WILL Why don't you believe me? I didn't write that email. Is this about Fran? She's the reason you don't trust me. Just because she fucked around on you it doesn't mean that I will. Ben, furious, starts drumming again. Tamara boiling with frustration, walks away. I wasn't pissed, or depraved or Can you go to the farm? Just take a look, see if anyone's been in. Thank you. Ben's really pissed off. He's massively got the hump - Ben appears from the other end of the large room. Got to go. Sorry. I've just asked him to go and check over the farm - What? He wouldn't do that. No way! There is no way Andy would do that! He hasn't done anything. Ben - where are you going? Don't go! Oh come on mum. She's just stirring shit. Tamara's always done that. Why's your father on there - and poor Andy? It's so tasteless. (helping with the sheets) You know how subversive she is. She once sent me a valentine from Prince Harry - and I believed it. It's her sense of humour; she likes causing trouble. At school she used to give us first years tips on how to shoplift. She taught you to shoplift? Mum, she's marrying Ben Sergeant. Why would she look at an old git like dad? Nicholas is in the shadowy hall, listening with interest. Poppy helps Beth upstairs with the laundry. Nicholas steps into the kitchen. Poppy has left the email on the table. Nicholas picks it up, deeply curious. What's all your fault? I'm bloody sick of you looking like a wet weekend. Who's Ben? What've you done? Are you in trouble? You take care with boys, Jody. You know what can happen. Are they crows or jackdaws? It's so nice to get these little details right. They're rooks. I've got an unhappy wife and a newly qualified vet discovering a forbidden world of physical love in a bird hide. I'm looking for Andy. Oh fuck off. Well I didn't send it. And I wouldn't shag you if you were the last man left after a nuclear winter. Drop dead you smug prick. Nicholas watches her storm back up the copse. Still time to change your mind. Blue skies. Fun in the sun. So. Nicholas. She lets the door fall open. She backs into the hall. Nicholas walks in. He closes the door. They look at each other. Neither of them moves. No. Nicholas is taken aback. He instinctively holds her. I'm just not myself. I used to watch you out of my window helping your daughter learn to skateboard up the lane. Bit of an obvious crush, wasn't it. No. I don't know why you're here. Why are you here, Nicholas? You can use me in one of your books. What about Beth? Bullshit. Isn't life complicated enough? Nicholas shakes his head. He kisses her. Oh poor you - was it awful? All my favourite teas - Oh! He embraces her. He is affectionate, magnanimous in his bliss. Beth is taken aback by his warmth. My goodness. You feel like my buzzy toothbrush just after I've charged it up. You should go up to London more often. I'm trying this magic realist bit at the end of chapter three, where the characters slowly turn into Do you think so? It's sort of the key to the structure, which I'm thinking of as a nest shape... Oh Glen. I'm glad you've come back. The bastard - I don't believe it. He gave his wife syphilis. He's completely distracted. He's up  and down to London all the time. The latest Inchcombe's taking  everything he's got. Is it any good? Because I keep - I'm well-known for it. Thank you. Admirably. You are so cheesy. Tamara is staring at him with something akin to distaste. Andy...  Behind the railings, the girls can't help their look of  disappointment at seeing her alive. I've had my head down, writing. I'd love to, but... I can't... I'm kind of on one with  my writing. Over her shoulder, Andy sees Nicholas' red scarf and coat hanging on the coat hook. He hides his shock. Tamara is  unaware that he has seen. Can we do it soon though? I'd  really like to; just not right now.  He nods at her in disbelief. He just came on the off-chance. He wants to know about roofing for  the shed... You fucking little slut. She puts her head in her hands. Hello Casey. How are you? Jody nudges her. Casey nods. Beth posts her mail. You waiting for the bus? So it did. Well. Hope it doesn't rain. She turns for home. Oh poor you. What a drag. Nicholas is on the motorway with a flat tyre. But I couldn't hear traffic. Just rooks... Did you ask me to read something? Nicholas, someone knows. Maybe we There's the festival brochure. You're on in the Lanson Marquee. I've marked a few bits in case you want to read. Beth hands him a hardback. I could come with you. But it's only Hadditon. I'll come. Have you got anything to tell me, Nicholas? I'm doing this cake in celebration.  Well done. (Looking to Andy) How do I find out who sent this? Did you know? Her... If you're kind to me, I'll cry. I don't want to cry. I must be very clear. I trod in the sponge mix. Andy? Andy emerges. Tamara smiles tentatively. Hey. How are you?  Andy says nothing. Would you like to have that drink? I  could do with a friend / at the  moment and - I'm not going to split them up. It's It's none of your bloody business. Shut up! Well I don't like `em. Dog-hair and slobber all over the place. No dogs, no way and that's final. Jody is devastated. Andy Cobb has rumbled us. I don't know. But he might. And I wouldn't blame him. Does it? Nicholas?... You write a lot about adultery. Is that from personal experience? Tamara turns round. Nicholas' colour drains. Beth is with Glen, close by - glaring at him. He tries to make a joke. Why do you cheat persistently on your wife? Nicholas considers whether he wants to be publicly humiliated. He decides not. It's got to stop, Nicholas. Nicholas, listen to me. We had fun. But it's wrong. And it's over. I'm sorry. Will you keep it down? Please don't shout. I do feel. I feel like I'm blazing away inside all the time. Why do I do these things? What am I doing with you? Oh for God's sake. Goodbye. Andy Cobb is a far better man than you! In saying it, Tamara realises it's true. She walks away. Nicholas bends almost double in pain, letting out a great moan from the soul. A fan has been waiting at a respectful distance. He approaches. Nicholas numbly takes his book. Instead of signing, he tears it to pieces. He hands the tatters back to the fan. I bet that bitch wants a baby. Well she'll find out; Nicholas doesn't do children. He'll leave it all up to her. That'll age her. But suppose he discovers fatherhood? They do, these men, second time round. They get all nappy-happy. I was barely twenty when I got pregnant. I've never done anything! Oh God! God! I hate him - I've wasted my life! Breeding goats? Baking fucking biscuits? It's meaningless! No. You may not. That's Ben Sergeant's dog. Perhaps  he's come to beat the shit out of  you - good! Good God, even when you try and  tell the truth you lie. YOU LIE!! Nicholas is falling apart. I want you to leave. I want a divorce. I want Stonefield. I will.And you - Go home! Bugger Off!! She throws a handful of chicken feed at him. Boss runs away. Beth storms off. Nicholas looks profoundly shocked; like a man who has just realised he's in danger of drowning. Ben... Ben? I can give her / integrity! It was you? Jody can't look her in the eye. Ben.  She takes the ring out of the jar and puts it in his hand. I'm in love with someone else. At that moment, Casey appears at the back door. Got `im. The beast. Bitch. Tamara looks up. Beth - no - Brazen. That is brazen. Beth carries on walking towards her. Beth. Don't. Tamara is running towards Beth. She cannot bear her to see. She throws her arms around her, protecting her. Don't look. Don't look... It is too late. Beth is seeing the corpse. A great wave of shock hits her. Tamara holds her tight, trying to contain it. Another great wave of shock. Nicholas. No. Her cries of grief soar over the valley. You'll get to it through Byley farm.  His skull is broken. It's smashed. No  I haven't but... it's obvious. His  wife. Yes she is. Thank you. Thank  you. I will.  Beth has turned Nicholas over. She is washing the mud from  his face with water from the trough. They're on their way...  Beth seems totally closed off. Tamara gingerly approaches.  She touches Beth's shoulder. Beth? Help is coming -  Beth cannot bear to be touched. Her hand involuntarily flies out. It slams into Tamara's face. Tamara steps back. Her nose is broken, pouring blood. It's broken! -  She gasps, riding the pain, knowing she deserves it. It's the  biggest wake-up call of her life. Beth stares at her, at first astonished at what she has done - then satisfied. Tamara stumbles away. I'm sorry.  She starts crying bitter tears. I don't want to be with Ben.  She looks back at Andy. He begins to understand. She walks  off. It was my fault. I let the dog go! I shooed him away! The police said it was an accident but... What I don't understand is why was he in that field anyway? He hated cows. And when they were coming, why didn't he get out of their way? Glen. Stay with me. Her eyes, still red with grief, are full of their future together. Glen nods. He will stay. He wants it all. Beth leans into him, seeking comfort. He puts his arms around her, his face ashen with the weight of his secret. As he holds her, he looks around the room. Nicholas is everywhere, glaring down at him from photographs. Don't say anything. You did it on purpose, didn't you? Made it so beautiful I'd never be able to leave. So you were. Welcome home.
