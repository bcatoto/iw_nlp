I can see you... -- and we know from yesterday that the base of a triangle times half the height equals the area. Yes, Mia? Lucy's asleep again. Let her sleep. And what you learned from your father now Diego's learning from you...? That really upsets you, doesn't it? A whole week without skipping school? Is that true? That's the last time I make a bet with you. (to his parents) See you guys next week. You cut your hair. It looks great. No one is trying to steal your child, they found bruises and cigarette burns -- Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report -- well, if you feel you need legal representation that's perfectly within your rights... Thirty-eight. No, absolutely not, look at this, Wayne, look, I'm buried -- Don't fight. Hey, that's his. Be honest. The whole psychology thing, it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it? You know what freaks me out? I sit there talking to these families, you know, like I'm some expert. My family's a train wreck. I mean, I had this moment today where I realized I might be totally full of it. Hey Becca... No, it's me, it's just been a crazy couple weeks. You remember Doug. I'm sure I would, I just... If it were anyone, it'd be you. What are they doing to you? What? Emily Jennings. Child Services? We spoke on the phone...? You said the seventeenth. Today is the seventeenth. Is not. I'm sorry, but it is. Friday was the thirteenth. Friday was the fourteenth, that makes today the seventeenth. Monday the seventeenth. The date of our appointment. Come down, I'd like to meet you. My name's Emily. What's yours? Lucy. Pretty name. Pretty girl. Is there somewhere we can talk? When do you expect your husband back? Because we've found it's more beneficial if the whole family participates. Well he's not home so... Do you have any way of contacting him? Not if I don't know where he is. Is that...? Would you ask him to join us? He doesn't have anything to say. Would you ask him? It'll be okay. Hi, I'm Emily -- I'm here today because Lucy's school is concerned about changes they're seeing in her academic performance. The kinds of changes they're seeing are often associated with family problems. Eddie says we don't have family problems. That's just it, many times a family won't even know they're having problems until it's too late. That's where we come in. We help families communicate and learn healthier ways of resolving conflict. Eddie says we don't need your help. Mr Sheridan, is there some reason you won't speak to me directly? Is there some reason why your husband won't speak to me directly? Eddie doesn't like speakin' out of anger. I didn't say weird, I said scary. The guy sat there the entire time staring at me, the mother is like his emotional slave. Wayne, this girl's in trouble. I can feel it. Every time I talk to you you sound more like a lawyer, you know that? You put these files in front of me and you ask me to tell you what's going on. Well, I'm telling you, there's something going on and it's not something good. I've done my job, I've told you, what you do with it is yours. Tell me, Mr Sheridan, since you've suddenly acquired the power of speech, doesn't it concern you a little that Lucy's grades have gone from A's to D's in three months? So you have no idea why she's falling asleep at school every day? Why she's not able to sleep at home? He's gonna be having bad dreams when he gets hit with child endangerment. (off Wayne's reluctance) Don't tell me you're buying this daddy's little girl routine? A little? Let me talk to her. Alone. She wants to talk. Five minutes. Talk to them about how much they love kids. I knew someone at school named Lucy, she was a writer. Do you ever write? I do sometimes, it helps me sort out how I'm feeling. Okay, I just shot like a gallon of water up my nose. So much for establishing trust. What's happening to you? I can help. Let me help. What is it, sweetheart? They hate me. I'm sure they don't hate you. They do. I hear them. They go in the cellar and talk. What do they talk about? Sending me to hell. You've heard them say that? It's okay. You can tell him. He's on our side. She doesn't trust anybody. You think I made it up? I'm not giving up on her, Wayne. I hope you can live with a dead child on your conscience. So that's it? We let kids get killed until they rewrite the goddamn laws? Surprise, surprise. Mike, I'm desperate here. This girl heard her parents say they're going to send her to hell. The system is broken. What? Jesus, I feel like I'm talking to Wayne. You don't want to get involved, fine, but don't bullshit me, I'm running out of people I respect. I just wanted you to know I haven't forgotten about you. I'm doing everything I can. If I disappear will you come look for me? You're not going to disappear. If I do? I have to go. They get mad when I miss the bus. Lucy, wait... If anything happens, call me, okay? Just press this. Don't let your parents know you have it. I'm gonna get you out of there, I promise. It's me, thought you might be up, um, anyway, call if you get this. Too late, I met someone else... (concerned but calm) Lucy? Are you okay? Why? Why are you scared, honey? Why are you sorry? Okay, listen, I want you to go over and open the window. Can you do that? Lucy...? Lucy, no, wake up! Lucy...?! Mike, it's Emily, listen, that girl I told you about, I think she's in trouble - - yeah, I know what you said, but -- Mike, you're not listening -- HELP ME! Saving her life! They're not asleep. Did you hear that? Leave her alone! Did you hear that?! Break it down! BREAK IT DOWN! LUCY?! Oh my God... I gotcha... I gotcha... I gotcha... Steal a pizza, San Quentin, try killing your kid, Freudian dream analysis. Did they or did they not know what they were doing? That's the legal standard. They knew, they knew damn well! (stops on a dime) Meaning what exactly? Oh, that's great - what is this, late- night cable? It's not my fault what happened. Yeah, I'm okay. How's she doing? Group therapy for kids, what's that say about the world? Good news. You get to leave here tomorrow. Doug said I might have to go to a state home. Only for a few days, till we find a better place. Why can't I live with you? Oh, sweetheart. That would never be allowed. Why? It's complicated, there's a whole process, I'm not even a foster parent... I'm sorry. Nothing? Hey, are you hungry? Let's get some lunch. What kind of food do you like? There's nowhere for me to go is there? I can't, Lucy, it wouldn't work, I live in this tiny house, I... I'm sorry, I'm not mom material... You don't have to be my mom. Just my friend. I know what it feels like to be that age and be unwanted. It's terrifying. She needs to be with someone she trusts; she trusts me. So much of our time is spent negotiating red tape, I think if we just look at the situation - this one situation, this one child - it's clear what's best for her. This is highly irregular and I'll tell you right now it makes me very uncomfortable. But since, Wayne, you've spoken so persuasively on Miss Jennings's behalf... I like to think of it as a glass-half- full situation. Kitchen. Bathroom. Fish. And here, is your room... Be okay? Where's your family? My family... well, I've met my dad twice and my mom's not a part of my life anymore. Why? (choosing her words) Sometimes people have kids and then decide they don't want to be parents. I'm glad you're here. What's this? Chamomile, when I get stressed out it helps me sleep. None of this ever should have happened, if I could make it go away I would. You did. I'm right down the hall if you need me. I have to grab some of her things, might take me a minute. I went by the house. I think her mom and dad were barricading themselves in their room at night. How sick is that? I'm coming around. Okay? This is your new beginning. I love you, Emily. I love you, too. Got it. What's up with Diego? Tell me what's going on. What happened? An eight-year-old did this? There's no way. Where is he now? You want to know what happened? I don't. I need to talk to him. Mike, please, I care about this kid. Diego... Let me in. He won't hurt me. What happened? Tell me what happened. You okay? It's just work. Don't worry. Why do you do it if it makes you sad? My job? I don't know, I guess... I guess maybe I want to believe families can work, so I can have my own someday, I don't know - does that make sense? (calls to other room) Breakfast. Honey, breakfa-- Come on, let me see... You went through my things? I'm sorry... I wanted to know what happened to you. Is that your mom? She used to just leave, she'd just... ...and I never knew when she was coming back, or if she was... I used to think it was my fault and I would try so hard when she got home to be good, do everything I could think of, so she'd think I was `special' and stay next time or take me with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd always go away again, that's how it was. Where was your dad? Gone, he left before I was born. First time I met him I was like thirteen. What'd you say to him? Oh, I had all these things I was gonna say. Angry things I'd thought of and kind of memorized. And um.... And then I met him and I wasn't angry, I was just sad and I told him... (pauses, raw emotion) I said, I love you, even if you don't love me. Are you mad at me? No... No, I'm not mad at you. (puts her arm around her) But I need you not to do that again, okay? Go through my private things without asking? Omelet's getting cold. Better hurry. You mean, to make sure I haven't missed anything else? She's not going back there, I'll take her out of state before I let them near her again. You wanted to talk about something? From who? What...? That's impossible. I might have called the week before...? Did you not hear me? I'm telling you, Mike, as a friend, I did not call that family. He's in my group... (puts down photo) ...why, did something happen? It wasn't me. I am telling the truth. My backup files are in your room. Diego's is in there. Maybe you got curious and went through some, dialed a number? It wasn't me, I swear. I didn't call him. Mike, she said no. Maybe someone made a mistake. Do you believe me? I believe you. Give me back my cases or fire me. Right now. I don't care if it's a hairline fracture, he broke her arm, I don't want him back in that house. He what? He found Christ? When? That recently? Uh huh. Well he should have found Him sooner. What's up? (re: Lucy's profile) How's it look? Do I have to beg or are you gonna tell me what's going on? She's `abnormally normal'? Why would she do that? No, I know, I just... The Martinezes' got a call Thursday night. From my house. She said she didn't. Mike thinks she's lying. I don't know what to think. Got you an extra in case it gets cold. I need to ask you something... about the night it happened... did you get a call, really late? You didn't? Diego, I know you did, they called from my house. What's the matter? What's scaring you? Oh God... It's okay... slow breaths... you'll be okay... (yelling down hall) Can somebody help us down here?! He asked to see you before you left. Who called you? Was it Lucy? Did she say something to you? Something that scared you? `El' dijo? What do you mean, `He said'? It was a man? Do... you... like... working... here? Well, photocopying isn't much fun. What...? This is weird. Diego said it was Lucy that called, but he called her a he, he said it was a man. Fine. No, they've been nice. That's not really what you want to talk about, is it, Doug? I'll tell you what scares me if you tell me what scares you. Me. Sometimes. I have bad thoughts. People. Certain people. You. I just do. (shakes her head) It's just the way you are... Facile. Easily comprehended. Often lacking sincerity or depth. You're smug, too. Want me to tell you what that means? Don't apologize. You're a grown up, it's embarrassing. Should we talk about school now? My grades are getting a lot better. Like what? What do I do with her in the meantime? Are you mad at me? No. Just tired. Want me to brush your hair? That's okay. Are you sure? Some other time. It will make you feel better. I'll get the brush. I said no, thank you. Doug said something, didn't he? No. Doug? He says you're doing great. What did he tell you? Nothing. You're funny. Get some rest. You forgot to kiss me goodnight. Goodnight. I love you. I love you, too. See you next week. Seen Doug? He had an appointment with one of my kids this morning, never showed up. Did you try calling him? All I get is voicemail. Cover my desk. Doug, it's me, it's Emily... Doug? Doug, you here? NOOOOO!!!!! Dr Johannsen? You did the autopsy on Doug Winters? How did he die? Friend. (preempting his reply) I know the rules -- please, he meant a lot to me. You're saying he did that to himself? Oh come on. He looked like he'd been beaten to death! Don't tell me he was some - some suicidal... ...I knew him! He was my best friend! Have you ever seen this before, somebody dying like this? You think it's my fault, don't you? It was an accident. It was nobody's fault. He was scared. He came out of that room with her, Mike, and he was scared. He said she threatened him. Diego said it was a man on the phone. You know who made that call. There was no one else in the house. (off his look) You think I don't know how crazy this sounds?! Why is he in that state of mind? Why was Doug? Pull my phone records. See if she called him. Her mother and father, their bedroom door has these deadbolts on it, big ones, two of `em... Something came through that door and they didn't want it ever coming through there again. You mean what were we doing it for? To kill her. God's will. `Cause she's not my daughter. I bore her, but she's not mine. `Cause she's not Of us. Not who, what. Stop acting like you don't know what I'm talking about. Not him himself, Of him, working in his name, in his honor. I don't care what you call it. Not what I think it's what I know. She can make you see things. Visions. Hell. Damnation. Whatever you're afraid of. People die around her, is that a special ability? Not by her hand, they just die. I had two brothers, Brent and Travis... ...and I mean they was healthy boys, healthy as can be. Eddie, three sisters. Soon as she was born they started dying. I guess she couldn't get rid of us till she found somebody else. Now that she has, I don't imagine we're long for this world. Okay. I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now, but you're... You're the only one I can talk to. Lucy's been staying with me - A friend. I, ummm... What is she? Done with me how? Why me? I don't have anything. What does she want? What should I do? Nancy...? Emily, I heard about Doug. I'm so sorry. Do you have a minute? How's it working out with the Sheridan girl? Actually, that's why I'm here. I appreciate what you did for me, Nancy, I really do, but I think it'd be best if she was placed in foster care. She is. You're it. I know, but it's not working out. Playing mommy isn't the laugh-a-minute you were hoping, huh? I suppose not. Sorry, you petitioned for custody, you got it. She's your responsibility. Until when? Till we find a suitable foster home. How long is that going to take? You're asking me questions you know the answer to. Three to six weeks. Surely you can manage that long. I don't want her anymore. I'm done. That's it. Now you look. I put my reputation, quite possibly my career, on the line for you. Don't embarrass me. You make this work. How do I make it work if it's not working? However! Find a way! Thanks. Hi. Hi. You weren't there so I took the bus. Sorry, work - lost track of time. It's okay, I know how busy you are. Doesn't matter anyway, the bus stops right at the end of the street. So I can always get home, whether you're there or not. Lucky. Where's the phone? Oh, it wasn't working... Wow. That one, too. Can I have a shower? We had gym today... Are they being nice to her? Who? My mother. How - how would I know that? I thought you said you were going to see her. I never said that. Hm. I must have dreamt it. I don't care, Robin, anywhere. Just find somewhere that will take her. Tonight. I don't want this girl in my house. Good night. Mike. `No such thing as a bad kid, only bad parents.' I always believed that. It's a lie. Her parents aren't crazy. Aren't you? Why did she lie about calling him? Mike, you know I'm not crazy. Don't run away from something just because it scares you. Who do you think you are barging in there like that?! I don't want her in group anymore, I don't want her around the other kids. Well that's not your decision, is it?! It's okay, Nancy, Emily's been under a lot of stress lately, but she's really nice to me and I hope I can stay with her a really long time. We'll talk about this later. See you next week, Nancy. You're never going back there. Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily? W-w-what's happening - ?! Can I go back to group next week? You're never going back there! Are you sure? No... I can see you. Don't be sad. This is your new beginning. Mrs Lynch, I told you - will you let - that's not what I said - no, I did not - you never sent me the - Mrs Lynch - will you let me respond? - will you let me - Mrs Lynch - will you let - SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU MISERABLE MISERABLE I don't want to go home. Emily... I know I haven't been a great friend lately, but... do you think maybe I could crash here for a couple of nights? Sure, when? Tonight and tomorrow. Em, any other weekend you know I'd say yes, but I just met this guy and he's coming over tonight like for the night and it might be, you know, kinda weird. LEAVE ME ALONE!!! Help me! Please! Let me on! She's coming! Please! Drive! DRIVE! I... I had some things to catch up on... I saw a doctor. They said mind your own fucking business! Wayne...? Hello...? Robin... You did? (under her breath) Oh God... I can't. I'm keeping her. If I get rid of her, if I put her into the system... I can't, Edward, I -- I don't have any faith. How... how do I...? (calls through door) Mike...? I like it here. I like you. You want me to like you, don't you? You have to do what I say. If I say I want to go to group, you have to do it. If I say I want a new dress, you have to do it. If I say I want ice cream every day after school, you have to do it. Okay? They did what I said for a while and then they stopped and started with the secrets. But they weren't really secrets I guess... (looks at Emily) ...because I always knew what they were thinking. Don't leave me. I'm happy you're getting the help you need, daddy. She's taking me apart, Mike. (re: Edward's photo) He told me I have to kill her. I'm not sleeping, I was hoping you could give me something. Why won't you tell me what's going on? Lucy...? Oh my God... Who is this...? No... he's... I have to go. What did you do to him? WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?! He did it to himself. Europa. Ganymede. Io. Callisto. The moons of Jupiter. We got back our astronomy tests today. Get out of my house. GET OUT! Don't yell at me. My mom and dad used to yell at me. Stay away from me! STAY AWAY FROM ME!! What are you doing, you silly pumpkinhead? You don't want me to come under there and get you, do you? I'm going to count to three. One... No... Two... Two and a half... Please... Two and three quarters... Three... Here I come. WHAT DO YOU WANT?!! What you wanted from your mother. I want you to love me. Okay... okay, I will, I will, I promise. Come tuck me in. Okay... I'll be right there. You better come. Chamomile. Maybe you should have it, you look stressed. I'll have one later. Tomorrow's our new beginning. I'll be good. I know. Get some rest. Say it. I love you. Forever and ever? Forever and ever. Where are you if I need you? Right down the hall. Sweetheart...? That was mean. Maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming pool. It's sad, isn't it? How it gets passed on. How people do to their own kids what their parents did to them. That's why you got the job... ...To prove to yourself you're not like her, that you're not like your mother. Because that scares you. Scares you more than anything. I love you... even if you don't love me. What are you doing? Slow down. Did you hear me? I said slow down! Please, stop, Emily, I'll be good. Look out! What are you doing?! It's not real. Yes, it is! Are you scared?! STOP! ARE YOU SCARED?! I'M NOT!! Where is she? Where'd they put her? Foster care? Is she with a family? You have to let me talk to them... Do you hear me?! Why can't I live with you? Oh, darling, we're not foster parents, we just help out when the system's full. Some nice family that always wanted a little girl.
