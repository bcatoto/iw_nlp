It's too hot for clothes. Hey... what's your name? Oh... wow. In what? That? RNewman / Endeavor Draft 4. That looks like me. What's this long, hard thing? Is it sharp? Good. I got him. Pobrecito. Como hice? (Sub: How'd I do?) Jesus, Sis. How long have you known this one? Twenty minutes? I'm trying to. I've got to get ready for work. And you're in my room. What a charmer. You sure know how to pick `em, Sis. Sure thing. I like a man who takes control. You're under arrest, dick. Yeah, this is Agent Elektra Rivers, Homeland Security. I could use some unis at the corner of Newning and Drake for an assault. Suspect in custody. (clicking phone shut) Yeah. Thanks. I gotta get dressed now. Suit yourself. You too, slut. Cafe! Taquitos! Tarjetas de llamada! (Sub: Coffee! Tacos! Long- distance calling cards!) Pancho vamanos! Leave him alone. He's a fat fuck, don't do nothing and eats all day, like my last husband. Thank god. Why buy the pig when I can get the chorizo for free? Be careful mi amor,and don't leave no scraps. Via con dios. Looking for something? Maï¿½ana me pages. (Sub: You can pay me tomorrow.) RNewman / Endeavor Draft 11. I do the carving around here pendejos. Come to mami. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 13. You still owe me, amigo. Two tacos y cafe. What's this? You! You're not Cisco. You're new here, aren't you? Well, one of the toilets in the ladies' is busted again, and you need to clean it up snappy. But this is an emergency! Hey, turn that up, would you? I'm watching it. What do you know? I'm gone, relax. (quietly in Spanish) They don't know you're here yet. You were brought in as a Juan Doe. Innocent bystander. Here he is, Doc. Hey Doc... I can feel your eyeballs in my uterus. Elektra Rivers, Department of Homeland Security. DHS has jurisdiction over everyone so give it a rest, Mr-- I appreciate that, sir, and I Is the shooter known to you, I mean, did you have any warnings or communication before today? My expertise is in profiling and assessing risks of potentially dangerous individuals who are in this country illegally. Would you like additional DHS officers assigned to your security detail? Here's my card, in case you change your mind. Or you think of anything else. Hijo de la chingada. What happened to you? You'll be safe here. No. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 35. Nothing worth nothing here, unless you were going to make a pinata. Now lie back. You know what this is, right? Works every time. When the sun rises, you'll be good. Cuidado, chico. You might burn yourself. You know why Machete. No, but I know the myth of the last honest cop in Mexico. Cada uno lleva su cruz (sub. We each have our cross to bear) RNewman / Endeavor Draft 36. Good. Now I can get some answers. McGraw? McGraw, are you here? Goddamnit! You're fucking my sister? Fuckin' liar. Did you at least get me the files? Well, where the hell are they? RNewman / Endeavor Draft 37. Never mind. I see `em. If you need me, I'll be in the bath. Slut. The nerve. An honest, dedicated American like John. What on earth were they thinking? I worry more about April. What kind of world are we leaving her? I think Cole is going to ask me to marry him. Oh, honey that's-- But I don't want to marry him. Terrible. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 38. I mean, look at me. I'm not ready for that kind of commission. That either. I have priorities. Good for you. I'm talking about my modeling. No it isn't. Do you know how many hits I've gotten on my website? I know what the online public wants, and they want me. All of me. Cole's just going to have to wait. (whispering to April) Are there cute guys on there? You need me to inspect them I think. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 39. No way! You're such a slut, Mom! You're a Cougar slut! "Problems with authority. Prone to violence. Fatalistic, ruled by a sense of destiny and purpose." (v.o.) "Father was a preacher who butted heads with the local drug baron." (v.o.) "Inherited sense of destiny from father." (v.o.) "Subject was the first to find him." (v.o.) "Subject developed Old Testament- style concepts of vengeance at an early age. Sense of righteousness." RNewman / Endeavor Draft 42. (v.o.) "Subject's macabre killing methods traced to childhood tragedy." (v.o.) "Recommendation: Total lockdown." No. But I read the ghost's file. My local contact Mcgraw got it from the hot sheets down south. Ex-boyfriend. Whatever. He's dangerous. I'm working on it. You want me to put this background on the air? Hey Culero, leave them alone. They don't like pork. Have you seen him? Cono,this won't end pretty. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 47. Hey, you're not the usual boy! That little bastard promised me a ride on his leafblower. Don't be shy. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 51. Why don't you come in? The water's fine. That's right. Come on in, sugar! We like variety around here, no matter what the boys say. You want a wine cooler? Oh, momma! He's got the good stuff! You can put the gun away. I'm not going to give you any trouble. Homeland Security. I guess that makes you a terrorist. Come on. Give me some credit. It's not every ex-Federale-turned- assassin that has a local priest on the family payroll. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 54. So are you going to tell me why you did it? Destiny, maybe? A job? Who hired you? The undocumented workers' union? Sonofabitch. Can you prove that? What? Why? You get around. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 55. Yeah, they came looking for you. I told them nothing, as far as I know you're a myth. "Feelings of righteousness and purpose." Sure thing, Boss. Sonofabitch! What the fuck, man? RNewman / Endeavor Draft 56. My gun! You're shot. Let me bring you to a safehouse. I can negotiate your safety. We'll bring Booth down together. You want onions?! Oh shit, you're delirious, dying. Don't die please. What? What do you do with... What, is this some "old Aztec" shit that's supposed to heal you? What do I do with this? Wait, you want this gunk squirted in there...I don't... I....can't. Fuck. Ahhhh! Mom? Where are we? I'm scared. Me, too, honey. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 58. What is this place? That was disgusting. Do you mind not breaking knives in the house? It's kind of one of my rules. I mean... Oh shit. All right. I'm going to tell him what you told me. Wish me luck. Yeah. I had a little fender bender. Calm down! I have him right now. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 59. Yes, but it's complicated. He's innocent. Sort of. Just listen. Michael Booth orchestrated the assassination attempt on McLaughlin's life. That's right. This was all some kind of hare-brained scheme to call off the ethics investigation. I think I can get Machete to testify. What? You again? You keep coming back up like bad menudo. Who's that? Your mother? Hijo de Puta! You're coming with me Maricons! I came back to look for you, and I found him like... this. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 67. "The more things change--" That's what my Grandma used to say. I'm sorry. Not me. I'm out. But others will. They don't care about Booth. They just want to wipe you out. You're an embarrassment to the feds. I guess I am, too. You could have killed me. I want to help you. First things first, I need a drink. Shit my heel is broke. It's nice having a man around. It's been a while. How long awhile you ask? Well, About two years. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 69. Oh that got your attention? Hmm, Actually you're better than my last boyfriend. He never listened. I don't know why I got so desperate. Don't want to grow old alone I guess. You ever get that feeling you're alone and that you'll never meet that one person... Are you listening to me? Give me that bottle. So what happens now, when you get him, that's it? It's over? Did you hear that? Stay here. Oh wow...is that a machete in your pocket or... I'm gonna fuck your brains out old man! Wow that was... Oh my god...did I wake the neighbors? RNewman / Endeavor Draft 71. This is one of ours. He works for the agency. My friend and I need a little help. Cabron, I told you it wouldn't end pretty. (to the guys) Bring him inside. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 73. It pays to have friends, Pendejo. They got your ass when you need it. Shit. I don't even want to know who she's fucking now. Fucking shit, bitch. Make him pay for a goddamn hotel. Sis? What's your name? I called in some favors. Look at this. All the right papers; a real identity. You could start over, be a real person. Where will you go? I'll ride with you. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 85. Say a prayer to El Machete to protect you.
