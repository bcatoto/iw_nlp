(looking at Megan) Sure, I'm Kristi. Megan. It's beautiful. We left the car there. Pretty quiet. You biked from Horseshoe? That's 20 miles or more. Yeah, you surprised us, sneaking up like that. It's kind of nervy seeing a lone guy walking up to you in the middle of the desert. ... and suddenly there's a guy right behind you and `wait a minute, why is he wearing a HOCKEY The Cathedral? We've got a bit disorientated and the map isn't great. Where is it? We climb. Are you ok? ARON! Of course he's ok. Listen to him. Got to be there, Meg. We've got to go again. And film it! I really can't eat all this chocolate by myself... Never mind, yes I can! So have you got a girlfriend, Aron? Ah, so there's lots of girlfriends. There's always a girl, you just don't know it yet. Yeah, we meet lots of guys and there's always a girl. With lots of characters in it. Wow, highest person in Colorado. ... you can be the highest person on the continent! Didn't you see it? Yeah, it's an old cattle guardian's house - the roof's caved in and someone spray-painted MOTEL 6 on the side. Smelled weird though. Why are you on your own? Phish? Not those guys from... An illegal instructor. Well, we'll sign your time-card today. Okay but don't look and no grabbing now, if I do... Oh whatever, you love it. Shhh! I didn't understand any of that. Kristi, I think this is our way back. How far is it? You'll never get out before dark. You don't climb at night, do you? Yeah, we'd like that. What time? Where? Come on Aron, hike out with us - we'll go get your truck, hang out and have a beer. Okay. Scooby Doo, yeah? 12 cold beers! OK - lights off and line up alongside me. On the other side of this line, everything will be different. And remember, stick together, the desert wants to kill you. That was your Mom! And your Dad called. Call him. We're going. See you next week. Oh, and Rana called. My boy. My only one. There you are. How are you feeling? You've been asleep for 2 days. We are so lucky... OK - he's got 3 vegetarian hotdogs and the tickets and he'll be outside Gate 6 in 5. Yeah. We split up a while back when you were in hospital. (always to the point) Is that what this is about? What about the climbing? Solo? (to change it) Well, all I can't figure out is what took you so long to cut it off and get one of these. (over her glasses) Not Jesus please... No Aron, it's not. You know, everyone who cares for you, a little bit of them dies each time you go back. Let's go hero. If they do The Fly first and we miss it we'll never be forgiven.
