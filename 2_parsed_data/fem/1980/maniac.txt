How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she? What do you mean &quot;our&quot;? Ha ha, you have been treating. I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it.

I want to be the first to bring him the news. He hardly knew of them him- self. I believe it was his uncle in Australia. He's inherited a fortune. It is--you know what a struggle he's had. You mean he doesn't work for you? I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--. How? What can I do? You can't double-cross me like that. You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power. I'm going to call the police. Dr. Meirschultz, please.I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night. It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
