That's right. Han! I thought you decided to stay. Han, we need you! Yes. (mystified) I need?  I don't know what you're  talking about. And what precisely am I supposed  to know? Yes.  You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. (haughtily) I had nothing to do with it.  General  Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for  any ships to leave the system until  we've activated the energy shield. I don't know where you get your  delusions, laser brain. My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half- witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf- herder! Why, I guess you don't know  everything about women yet? (over loudspeaker) Headquarters personnel, report to  command center. Then it couldn't be one of those  creatures that attacked Luke. (into comlink) What was it? (into comlink) An Imperial probe droid. Yes, Captain (irritated)  We have thousands of probe droids  searching the galaxy.  I want proof,  not leads! It could mean anything.  If we  followed every lead... My lord, there are so many uncharted  settlements.  It could be smugglers,  it could be... Lord Vader, the fleet has moved  out of light-speed, and we're  preparing to... Aaagh! All troop carriers will assemble  at the north entrance.  The heavy  transport ships will leave as  soon as they're loaded.  Only two  fighter escorts per ship.  The  energy shield can only be opened  for a short time, so you'll have  to stay very close to your transports. The ion cannon will fire several  shots to make sure that any enemy  ships will be out of your flight  path.  When you've gotten past the  energy shield, proceed directly to  the rendezvous point.  Understood? Good luck. Stand by, ion control... Fire! (over loudspeaker) The first transport is away. It's risky, but we can't hold out  much longer.  We have no choice. (to an aide)  Evacuate remaining ground staff. Why are you still here? You got your clearance to leave. (to controller)  Send all troops in sector twelve  to the south slope to protect the  fighters. (over loudspeaker)  Imperial troops have entered the  base. (to head controller)  Give the evacuation code signal.   And get to your transports! Would it helped if I got out and  pushed? This bucket of bolts is never going  to get us past that blockade. Someday you're going to be wrong,  and I hope I'm there to see it. Saw what? They're getting closer! Watch what? (over comlink) Han, get up here! Asteroids! What are you doing?  You're not  actually going into an asteroid  field? You don't have to do this to  impress me. I take it back.  We're going to  get pulverized if we stay out here  much longer. Closer? What looks pretty good? I hope you know what you're doing. Let go. Let go, please. Captain, being held by you isn't  quite enough to get me excited. (still struggling) Would you please stop calling me  that? Oh, you make it so difficult  sometimes. Occasionally... (a little smile,   haltingly) ... when you aren't acting like  a scoundrel. Stop that. Stop that!  My hands are dirty. (looking right   into his eyes) Afraid? I'm not trembling. I happen to like nice men. No, you're not.  You're... (in hologram) ... and that, Lord Vader, was the  last time they appeared in any of  our scopes.  Considering the amount  of damage we've sustained, they  must have been destroyed. (out of breath) There's something out there. Outside, in the cave. Are you crazy?! Then I'm going with you. This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. I don't know.  I have a bad feeling  about this. Mynocks? The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... (angry) I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light- speed in this asteroid field... The cave is collapsing. What? (almost expecting   it) No light-speed? You're going to attack them?! Shut up! They're moving to attack  position!  Shields up! Track them.  They may come  around for another pass. They can't have disappeared.  No  ship that small has a cloaking  device. Captain, Lord Vader demands an  update on the pursuit. (drawing a breath) Get a shuttle ready.  I shall  assume full responsibility for  losing them, and apologize to Lord  Vader. Meanwhile, continue to  scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa. What did you have in mind for  your next move? With the rest of the garbage. Then what? No.  Where are we? Anoat system.  There's not much  there. Lando system? Thanks. (reading from the   computer) A mining colony? Can you trust him? You do have your moments.  Not  many, but you have them. I thought you knew this person. Who's worried? I don't like this. (wary) Yes... very friendly. Leia. The sooner the better.  Something's  wrong here.  No one has seen or  knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have  gotten lost. I don't trust Lando. And then you're as good as gone,  aren't you? What happened? Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you  think you can repair him? No, thanks. Not really. (coolly) Thank you. So you're part of the mining  guild then? Why are they doing this? Lando. What about Han? Vader wants us all dead. And we're the bait. (dabs at his wound) You certainly have a way with  people. I love you! Luke!  Luke, don't - it's a  trap!  It's a trap! What do you think you're doing? Do you think that after what you  did to Han we're going to trust  you? Oh, so we understand, don't we,  Chewie?  He had no choice. We don't need any of your help. What? Chewie. Luke... We've got to go back. I know where Luke is. Chewie, just do it. It's Luke.  Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay.  Easy, Chewie. (into intercom) Lando? I'll be back. Star Destroyer. If your people fixed the  hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
