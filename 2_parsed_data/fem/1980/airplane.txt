No, but thank you very much. Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago. Go, O.J., go!! Ted! I just don't want to go over it any more. I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that. It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect! I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run. Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing? Your war record? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history. It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility. It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry. Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped. Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much. Every day. Nervous? First time? We'll be taking off real soon so we better fasten you in tight. Thank you. Oh Mother, this is so exciting. I know, but remember you must get some rest. That's good advice. You relax and I'll be back after we take off. Oh, good-bye, Bill! Have your picture taken as soon as you get there and send me one! Don't you go getting fat or anything. Oh, but it's your watch. You shouldn't. You'll need it. Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time. Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill. Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling. Would you like something to read? Do you have anything light? How about this leaflet: 'Famous Jewish Sports Legends?' Yes. Thank you. Ted, what are you doing here? You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now. Oh, stewardess... Excuse me. No wonder you're upset. She's lovely. And a darling figure. Supple, pouting breasts. Firm thighs. It's a shame you're not getting along. That's very nice of you. Thank you. Ah, won't you sit down? No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men. Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.? Would you like to order dinner now? I tell you what, Joey. I'll talk to the Captain and see what I can arrange. Would you gentlemen care to order your dinners? Oh, Ted, I never knew I could be so happy. These past few months have been wonderful. Tomorrow why don't we drive up the coast to that little seafood place and... What's the matter? Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much. I love you. We have a visitor. This is Captain Oveur. Mister Murdock and Mister Johnson. This is Joey Hammen. We'd better get back now. Okay, if you don't get in the way. I remember everything. All I have are memories. Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us. But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past! You got a telegram from headï¿½quarters today. It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news? Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful? Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately. I found a wonderful apartment for us. It's got a brick fireplace and a cute little bedroom with mirrors on the ceiling. And... What's his problem? I will, but Jim won't. Yes? Oh yes, I saw. Poor child. Of course. Oh, I think that would be nice. Hi! I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar! Oh, I'd love to. Who wants to be first? How's the weather? That's great. By the way, Joey Hammen asked me if you would autograph this basketball. Also, Supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers to help stretch your food dollar.

It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war. Oh, I can't stand it. Yes? My, stomach. I haven't felt this awful since we saw that Lina Wertmuller film. I'll see if I can find some Dramamine. OOOOOO. Captain, one of the women passengers is very sick. I think so, but I've never seen it so acute. I'm sorry I had to wake you. I'm just looking for a doctor. There's nothing to worry about. Stewardess, I think the man next to me is a doctor. Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor? We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them? A hospital? What is it? Certainly. Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish. He had fish. Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please? Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why? Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too. He had fish, too. Just how serious is it, doctor? Uh, automatic pilot...automatic pilot? There it is! This is Elaine Dickinson. I'm the stewardess. Captain Oveur is passed out on the floor, and we've lost the co-pilot and navigator, too. We're in terrible trouble. Over. Hi, Steve! Yes. Yes, it is. Over. I'm standing over Oveur. Over. Three hundred twenty miles per hour. Thirty-five thousand feet. No, wait. Now it says thirty-four thousand feet. It's dropping! It's dropping fast! Why is it doing that? Oh, my God! The automatic pilot! It's deflating! Okay, but please hurry! We're dropping fast! Yes. Yes, I can see it. No. Well... No. No one that I know of. Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out. Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there. Something about a plane with no pilot? Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there. Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here. Are you a pilot yourself? Certainly not. Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane! I've got to get out of here! I can't stand it! I've got to get out of here! Doctor, you're wanted on the phone. Everything will be all right. Please get hold of yourself. Rain. And a little ice! Sluggish. Like a wet sponge. It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts. Oh, stewardess, I can speak jive. He said he's in great pain and wants to know if you can help him. Shi gwine man chitlun down for mo sho. '...I sit by the telephone for hours. I love when men send me flowers. I enjoy being a girl.' Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up. Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to. Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer. I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me. Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff. I'd be glad to. Ooooh, such a nice soft drink. Hello? Yes, this is Missus Oveur. I'll be right down. I've got to go to the airport. You can let yourself out the back door. There's juice in the refrigerator. Oh, you're all so concerned about performance! No, thank you, I'm still nursing this one. There, just a little bit more -- and then burpie time and a good nap! Doctor Rumack says the sick people are getting worse and we're running out of time. He's dead. He's dead! 'What you want, Baby I got, What you need, You know I got it. All I'm askin' for Is a little respect When you come home.' Lorison, do you have any idea when we'll be landing? Well, to be honest, I'm very scared. But at least I've got a husband. What happened, Ted? What went wrong? But Ted, you're the only... Steve! That isn't much of a chance, is it? Stewardess, how soon 'til we land? Ted... I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud. The gear is down. No. I'm all alone. That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me. Uh-huh. Airspeed one twenty-five, one thirty... ...one thirty-five, one forty.
