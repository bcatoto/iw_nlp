Poppa! Poppa... may we go in there? Alright... Your turn. Oh,look M-ummy! Elephants! Oh, elephants! We'll go see them. You won't be long? Oh yes they are, they're yours  alright. Darling, don't be difficult! Let's  take our sweet lovely children on an  outing. Children save yourselves! Prevail  upon your Pappa! Beast, Beast... Did it go well, darling? Yes, and they send their kisses.  Would you like your sherry now? Nora! Mind your duties... if you  don't concentrate dear, you'll only  make more work for the rest of us.  Now, get about your business. ...and do get your collar straight,  dear. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Mothershead. Do get on with it, Nora. Breakfasting with the patients this  morning, Mr. Treves? Yes, sir. Yes Sir. I'm sorry, Sir. Yes. Fine. I've heard. Sir, you don't have to worry about  me. I'm not the sort to cry out.  Shall we go in? How do you do? Sit still. Don't wiggle about like a  pup. I won't stand for any  foolishness. The workhouse. Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be  his bath-time soon. Has he eaten? Won't come out, eh? Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle  it. Alright, my son, none of this fuss.  Come up from there, this instant. Honestly, sir, you must be very firm  with this sort. Otherwise they'd lay  about on the floor gibbering all day  long. All he understands is a good  smack. Perhaps you've got the time for that,  Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've  got an entire hospital to look after,  and you have your real patients.  Don't waste your time with him sir,  it's like talking to a wall. I don't  mean to be harsh, but truthfully  what can you do for him? I'll be  back later for his bath. And Mr.  Carr Gomm would like to see you when  you have a moment. Good day sir. Oh, Mrs. Mothershead, please forgive  my behavior yesterday. I'm sorry if  you're having to do extra work on my  account. It was just seeing it... Patients here are not "its". They  are either "he's" or "she's", but  that's alright, Ireland. This one's  going to be more work for all of us.  Good God girl! Mind your broth. Good Lord, Mr. Treves! Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves.  It's all very nice, but I don't see  the point. You know they won't let  him stay here. Freddie? Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so  discouraged. What do you mean? But I thought you said that he was  rather... simple? Frederick, why are you so interested  in this particular case? Perhaps you're just polishing a stone,  endowing this Elephant Man with  qualities he doesn't possess? I'm sure I don't know, Freddie. Well, these things take time. Read it. Credit where credit is due. You'll  have the paper every morning at  breakfast. ...terrible though his appearance  is, so terrible indeed that women  and nervous persons fly in terror  from the sight of him, and that he  is debarred from seeking to earn his  livelihood in any ordinary way, yet  he is superior in intelligence, can  read and write, is quiet, gentle,  not to say even refined in his mind. I'd very much like to meet that  gentleman. He sounds almost  Shakespearean. There are cleaner rooms in the  gasworks. Who's all the fuss for, then? Don't you know? It's for that strange  one. Mr. Treves' Elephant Man? I hear  he's got a trunk. Right, right. Blimey, now we're cleanin' up for  circus animals! Well, I think I can safely hand the  duties over to you girls now. Mr.  Merrick will require a bath every  day... that way he won't pong quite  so much. Nora, you can instruct  Kathleen on the finer points of Mr.  Merrick's bath. You'll be on your  own tomorrow. Don't look so glum girls. Such  enthusiastic volunteers should be  more cheerful. Oh, and girls, under no circumstances  are there to be any mirrors brought  into this room. He's... so ugly! Ugly or not, you're going to help  me. Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick? You look very nice in your new  clothes. Well, if there is nothing more, I  suppose we'll be leaving you now. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.  Merrick. Would you like a nice cup of tea,  Mr. Merrick? Mr. Merrick, sugar? One or two? Do you? Oh? And here is one of Frederick's mother. And here are my mother and father. I've always thought that myself. Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful. Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as  loving as you are could ever be a  disappointment. Good morning, Mr. Merrick. What is this that you're doing? What is it? What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips.  Oh, of course. Why... why that's  very good, I mean you've gotten the  windows and arches just right. But it's so good, I mean... it's so  very good. Where did you get this box? The hallway? Oh, the wastecan! It's alright, it was thrown away. No  one wants it. It's just that it's a  little dirty, that's all. What's this? The... oh, the spire! How silly of  me, it's as plain as day... Mr.  Merrick, where did you learn to do  this? Oh, but how will you finish it? You  haven't any more cardboard. Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick. Mummy, listen to this! Hush, Jennifer, can't you see Mummy's  talking? But it's about Mrs. Kendal, mummy!  The actress you go on so much about! "Mrs. Kendal, always at the forefront  of fashion and form, was seen leaving  The London the other afternoon. No,  dear readers, the most facile actress  of our day has not been taken ill,  but rather said she was 'visiting a  friend'. And who was the lucky  recipient of this attention? Quick  enquiries proved it to be none other  than Mr. John Merrick, The Elephant  Man, with whom our readers are  undoubtedly familiar. After a chat  of three-quarters of an hour, Mrs.  Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr.  Merrick with an autographed portrait  of herself. Owing to a disfigurement  of the most extreme nature, Mr.  Merrick has never been properly  presented to London society. But  knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal  goes, others inevitably follow, the  questions arises: Will London society  present itself to him?" Parkins, whose carriage is that? Lord and Lady Waddington! Well. Drive  back to the house. I can't be seen in this. Watery headed bunch. Oh no, Mr. Treves, the pleasure was  all ours. Good day. Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a  word with you. I can't understand why you let those  people go in there, sir. But you saw them, sir. They couldn't  hide their disgust. They don't care  anything for John, they're just trying  to impress their friends. I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him  and cleaned up after him! If loving  kindness can be called care and  practical concern, then yes, I did  treat him with loving kindness, and  I'm not ashamed to say it. If you ask me, sir, he's just being  stared at all over again. No sir, Mr. Merrick. I have something for you. I thought these things would be  helpful with your cathedral. Mr. Treves, some more books arrived  for Mr. Merrick. Yes sir. What's that? Very smart indeed. A dressing bag? Well... A dressing bag? Dinner will be served, shortly, dear. More romances for John? ...Freddie! What's the matter? You've  been like this all evening. Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched  vampire say to upset you? Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no  Frederick, that's all wrong! John is  happier and more fulfilled now than  he has ever been in his entire life.  And, that is completely due to you. Frederick, just what is it that you  are saying? Oh Frederick. You're a good man. A very good man. Is this all there is for John? What is it? What is it? Welcome home, John. Come on, Jack. Good God... John? Done. Look! It's Dover! Little beast! I thought mummy told  you not to bring that horrid thing.  Can't you behave? Do be quiet Little Jim. Can't you  see Mummy is speaking? Hey Mister, why is your head so big? Mister! Why don't you answer me? Now I'll see you... My son! My son! Help! Stop that man! Stop that man! There's a policeman to see you, Sir. Your majesty shall mock at me; I  cannot speak your England. Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is  "like me". O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes  sont pleines de tramperies. Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be  full of deceits. Thank you for your warm greeting. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's  performance was very special to me,  because it was very special to someone  else, a man who knows the theatre  and loves the theatre, and yet tonight  is the first time he's ever actually  been here. I would like to dedicate...  the whole company wishes to dedicate,  from their hearts, tonight's  performance to Mr. John Merrick, my  dear friend.
