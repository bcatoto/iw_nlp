Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment. Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful. I've always thought that myself. And here is one of Frederick's mother. Oh? One or two? Mr. Merrick, sugar? Oh Frederick. Frederick, just what is it that you are saying? Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you. Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you? ...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening. More romances for John? Dinner will be served, shortly, dear. And here are my mother and father. Do you? Well, these things take time. I'm sure I don't know, Freddie. Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess? Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case? But I thought you said that he was rather... simple? What do you mean? Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged. Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now? Did it go well, darling? You won't be long?Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits. O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies. Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me". Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.Welcome home, John. Well... A dressing bag? Very smart indeed. Yes sir. What's that? Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick. I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it. But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends. I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir. Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you. Watery headed bunch. Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here. Good Lord, Mr. Treves! Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir. Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it. Won't come out, eh? Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten? The workhouse. Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in? I've heard. Fine.Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick. The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this? What's this? It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all. The hallway? Oh, the wastecan! Where did you get this box? But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good. What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right. Good morning, Mr. Merrick. Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now. Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
