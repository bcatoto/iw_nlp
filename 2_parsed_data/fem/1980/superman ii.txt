Good. My heart can't take it. I like trees. I wouldn't know. I've never had one. Look at this! Snow. Ice. Your idea of a good time. You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really. A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex. C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ? There is some good in you, Lex, after all. Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis? That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . . Wrong. It's beautiful. No, me, me, me. Thank you. Genius! -- Lex. This way Lex. Why am I doing this? Why am I here?And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you? Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton. Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility -- You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to -- You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest. Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream. The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that - The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question. And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity. The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty - For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals." -- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.Everything on it. Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go -- Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know. Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not. . . . Superman?. . . . . I'm fine. . . . . . What was I talking about? Before? See what happens when I don't have my orange juice? The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ---- . . . gee . . . Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . . . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that. Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me. Oh, I'm not blaming you. I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity. Some rival, huh? Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick. Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do. Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . " I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying? Never closed my eyes. Oh, hi. Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . . But what can you do? There's no way now . . . I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with. Let's get you inside . . . . Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . . You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say. Your place? Maybe I should change, Maybe you should, too. I want to. "What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk? I'm listening. I'm in love with you. How do you feel? Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . . Maybe you wanted to. I was right. you are Superman. It's true. It's true. Oh Clark, no! Because of what I'm betting. My life. Uh-uh. Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it? Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool -- Don't fake me out, Clark. Or whoever you are. And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that? I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear. Where were you? Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold. Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry. Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry. That's because you can hardly see through those things. Mr. Smith - -- the "complimentary couch." Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill. Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls. I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter - -- uh, reporters -- on this. Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes. Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers. In July??? Of course, that's what friends are for. Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care? Be my guest. Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis. No, this was good enough for my mother -- Well, you shouldn't Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do. Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you. Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism? Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you. Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills. No, this is -- -- natural. Well, you never will again! Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day. When was the last time you heard me sneeze? Do I detect a note of jealousy? Then maybe you should get your glasses checked. But him is you. Now I'm confused. It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent. Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it. Like it? It's magnificent! Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time. I must be. But I'm not. Your home. This is your home. The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its -- Superman! The --"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right. General --- ? He's captured Non! Sentimental idiot. Yes? You are master of all you survey. Look, they need a machine to fly. What shall we do now? DELETE IN CUTTING DELETE IN CUTTING ) There . . .
