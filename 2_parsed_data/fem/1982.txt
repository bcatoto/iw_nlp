Now you're talkin'. See ya... Hey, don't do that. I said I wasn't a pro, remember? Hello, again. Well, maybe I'll see you later ... What's the matter with my place? You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'? You're in a hurry. Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on? No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'. Hey, what kind of talk is that? I'm candy...You're impossible... Tell me. Where is he? I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that. How'd they take it back at headquarters? What do I know? I'm just a bartender. Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out. When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible. It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him. What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes? Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type. But this Indian... Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody... You real down? I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened? I ought to have you and your friend thrown out... Hey, I don't believe it. Fuck you. Hello. Jack, wait... Jack? What was that? So am I. No wonder you're so popular. I'm at work, asshole. Where else? This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave. Just one. Some lady called. Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible.... I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it. Here it comes again ... the sacred job... Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop. It's not a practical way to function... Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun... Jack, are you okay? You made the front page. Great place for lunch. I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge... Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure... Call me later. You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless. I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance. When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are. Maybe that makes a nice excuse. That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning. Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back. You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning. Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it. If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference. Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit? Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch. I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do... Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker. A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today. I'm all wet. You're hopeless. I still don't think it's loaded. I don't think your gun's loaded... What am I wanted for? In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me. The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend. Have you two ace detectives checked that out? That's no bull. How would you know? Shrink major, not a shrink. I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop. Who the hell are you?Alright, I'm coming...hold on. What do you want? What do you want? What's goin' on? What the hell's wrong? I didn't do anything. Hey...Commissioner, Aquarius. Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor... I was reading too. I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down... That just doesn't make any sense. What? You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board. Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown. Forget it. The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.Ted, the lever! Compute! Set! Not when I'm with you, Ted. What will happen to him, Ted? You mean... Simon just ejected! I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will. That was very well put, Ted. I mean until we start to burn up. Ted, we've only got ten minutes. Ted, please be careful. Ted, there's no time to explain. Ted! Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone. I'd use the word insane. The word is sick. Ted -- very, very, very sick. I've never used the word insane, Ted. Ted, get a grip on yourself. You should never have left the hospital. We can't go back. We had something very special, but it's all over. Ted. I don't know why you got on this flight. I don't know what you're trying to prove. Ted! Ted. What are you doing, Ted? Ted, we're taking off! Ted! What are you...? Goodbye, Ted. I don't want to hurt you. If that's the way you want it. Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick. Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time. And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon. And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now. Who's that, Ted? Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better. Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon. He's stable. He's a good provider. I want that at this stage of the game, Ted. He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man. Ted, please. You're just making things difficult for yourself. Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti. Ted, you're overworked. You've been flying yourself into the ground. Ted, what's wrong? But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out. Te...! Is he making any progress, Doctor? Is that a good sign, Doctor? I mean for Ted. What can I do, Doctor Rumack? Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor. Simon, what are you saying?! Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends! You'll die out there. Your career! What about the lives of those people out there. Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved? Can't we change course? Simon, what's happening?! Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit. I think so. Don't be too long. Simon, why has he become so... so... No, I've been excited before. I'm so excited, Simon. But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe. And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon. I'm a very lucky woman. Simon. No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit. You can do it from up here, Captain. We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system. I don't think we have any alternative, Captain. Yes, sir. Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes. Request; life support systems check. Request; comprehensive electrical systems check. Go ahead. That's okay, ROK. That's not possible. That doesn't make sense. Repeat analysis. Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.Um... Do you people scream right when you... you know. Yes it did. Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question? Yes I did... Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it. All right, Captain Oveur. Over. Poached and over, Captain Oveur? Over. How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over. What should I say? A b... Sixteen 'C', why?Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury. Let's go, Daddy. We have to check in. He was never appreciated at the Institute. Yes. Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays. No. It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying. Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love. Not if the people change together in relation to that love. Love's the same as it always was. It's people who change. No. I mean your relationship. Do you want to talk about it. No, I mean your head. Sit down. I'll take a look at it. I'm a nurse. You've been hurt. You don't have to excuse yourself. I'm a nurse. I understand. Yes. He's dying a-n-d wants to be buried on Mercury. You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington. Excuse me, are you alright? I noticed you talking to yourself. I'm a nurse. Can I be of some help?What...? Okay, Joey. The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country. Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency. Take this, Joey. It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.Then go get him. Not to be trapped. Anywhere. Let's go while there is still time. I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us. If he won't cooperate? You certainly have a nice place here. We were worried to death. It's awfully kind of you.I want to do it. I think, therefore I am. Then we're stupid and we'll die. This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian. Tomorrow, he says. He's not ready yet. What makes you think so? Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much. As a matter of fact I did. They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow. Is that why you're still here? What's that? What's your problem? And you live in this building all by yourself? Thanks. Just better. Whatcha doin'? I was hoping you'd say that. I'm hungry, J.F. We scared each other pretty good didn't we? I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying. They left. I don't have one. Hi. Pris. I was tired and didn't have any place to go.That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me. You know what I think? What difference will it make? Do you think I simulated what happened between us? Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered? Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder? Ten years. Uh-huh. Have you ever known anybody a long time? You're sick, Deckard. This feels stupid. But then how can you... But if I don't plug it in how can I... They could clean around the arrangement. It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody? Have you ever cleaned your apartment? When was the last time you cleaned this place? I'm not sure. Is there a secret? I don't know... I think I missed something. I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to. I guess I thought there was something more to it. Nobody is freer than when he dreams. I read that. That's another thing I can't do. Did you cry when your father died? I wish I could. Do you dream? What do people do in the afternoon? How are you doing? How come you're not on the job? Oh. Where is he? Who is this? You didn't hear me. You were sleeping. I told you I'd come back. There's a lot I haven't done with a man before. What do you want me to do? They probably want to find out when they were made. Can you? I couldn't. I'm sorry. Do I make you nervous? So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me. You use your equipment, don't you? Two of us might be more effective than one. There's two reasons a man rejects help. Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it. I think you need more help than you've got. I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help. Ugh. It would be my child. That would be murder, Mr. Deckard. I'd never get an abortion. Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian? I'd kill it. I'd take him to the doctor. I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police. For the responsibility of your power. Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share. Are you apprehensive? Of course not. But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem. Correct, Mr. Deckard? It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.And who do I go to about you? I bet I would. Hey! Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh? Jeezus! Come on. The best. You mean the snake. Of course he's not real. You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake? What the fuck for? Are you for real? How do you mean 'exploited'? I don't know nothing about it. Yeah?Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda. And they don't call my parents? I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something. Are you Linda Barrett?And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either. Not if you're over sixteen. All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's. Yes. There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them. I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it. Well I might go to Dartmouth. Yeah, like maybe never. He says he's got to stay in Chicago. He says I should visit him sometimes. He's not coming. Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV. What do you want? Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open. Stacy, he's not a guy. He's a little prick! There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this. That little prick. That little prick. You're right. I didn't tell you that. What? But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too. Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here! It couldn't be. What do you think it is? You have been acting very strange the last few weeks. God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban. Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips? God, he hardly even talks anymore. No. I think they're both virgins. He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him. I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes. No. But it's a nice idea. Climax together. You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck. Okay, penis, that's one, balls... Why don't you put your mother's secret book back? I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here. Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen? Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday. Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on. I guess Ron hasn't called yet. You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy. Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games. Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him. Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again. Hey! That's my line! So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious? You'll always remember your first time. Was it great? Just kidding. About 10cc. There's nothing to it. What's the big deal? What variables? What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't. Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them. I know. God. People exaggerate so much at this school. I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning. Believe it. If I didn't have a fianc� in Chicago, I'd go for it. Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will. Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies. I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him. Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call. Should we buy a frame for that? Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot. Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man. Don't you like him? How's it going.Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing. If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back. I don't want to talk about it here, Brad. Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool. How much did they cost? Were those flowers really for me, Brad?No. Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad... Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it. Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do. It's just Linda. And Mark from school. Maybe yes. Maybe no. But your face did! You are a virgin! I don't know. I was just curious. Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin? Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa. I'm just guessing. Why? Because she won't sleep with you? You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you? Is everything okay at work? It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him. Thanks for getting rid of those flowers. I'll explain everything later. Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work? Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this? Don't strain yourself. Your friends use the pool too. Why can't you do it? U.S. History. Mr. Hand. Hi, Brad. Get going. Mike! You have a mess on C-9! Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic. It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic. We've got to get an abortion? Take that back. I know it's yours. Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant. Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it. I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you. I didn't see you this morning. I guess I did. What's wrong? I think we're making a lot of noise. Hey, Mike? I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not. How about both of us at the same time? Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike? So are you. Are you shaking? He's my friend, too. Are you really a virgin? Pick a suit. Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change! Do you want to take a quick swim? Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out? I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one? Sure. Come on in. Mark is a really nice boy... Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself. I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag. O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay? Oh, really? Nice to meet you. Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss. I can't believe it! But what about Doug? Dartmouth?! But what are you going to do? Sometime? Not coming? What happened? Where's Doug? I want romance. You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex. Another summer of working at Swenson's. Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy. I paid for it and everything. Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father. I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited... You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old. You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys. I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him. It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone. What do you think it is? I don't know... I just don't feel right. I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing. God, I don't think so. Better look in the house. I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms. I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda? What do you think? What's Doug do in Chicago? How long does Doug take? Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.' Does that ever happen? All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?' Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category? Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?' You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school. Sixteen. What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner. Thanks a lot. I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out. Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen? Not since November. I think Christmas brings out the worst in people. If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen. Does Doug care that you're seventeen? There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen. Come on, Linda. It's just sex. It was nice. It was okay. Oh! That's where that group got its name from. Well I never did it. Like, you know, giving blow jobs. No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at. Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed. Do you think guys find that attractive? Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar. No way! He just called him a dick. I can't believe I start high school tomorrow. He was hot, wasn't he? Really? I can't do that. So what did you do? Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week? He gave me his card. 'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.' What should I do? Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really. Do you think that guy's cute? Yes. What about those other guys you live with? Yes... I am really nineteen. It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last? That's a nice shirt. The point sounds fine. I don't know. Wherever you want. Thanks. So do you. Thanks for picking me up. What can I get for you tonight. I know, everyone says that. I'd like that. Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer. I know everybody says it, but I really mean it. I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year. Hi, Mark. What about the notes? I made a fool of myself. Oh. I see. John Bonham? What's April 16th? Where's Mike today? Do you really have to go? This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan? Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right? Thanks. So... What do you want to do? Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind. I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink? No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house. Do you want to come inside? Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck. Sure. I'll... have another Coke. Not at all. Are you all right? I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special. I've heard that, too. Yeah. She is pretty good. Do you have Mrs. George for English? This is a nice car. Thanks for coming to get me. Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink. What's your other question? We keep them, in case the people come back. We keep them.I think it's time to take the gloves off. Get me some reporters. Particularly Louella Parsons! That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it. I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me. I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me... Very fine bone structure. Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more? Who's this? I'd like nothing better. That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act. No, I'm concerned with everything. Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I? Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude. Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It." I intend to make a great deal of money off you. I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich -- You see: We've got to change that name.I guess so, sir. Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option. Good morning, Mr. Bebe! ...acts. I'll relay your message. I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know? That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies. You know what I mean. Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously. Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car -- Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes. Hi Frances, got a minute?'Forgive'...? For What? Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch? Putting on my armor. Refill my drink, will you, Bob? So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too? You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, let's go get 'em. But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change. This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster. Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it. But I'm the one up there on the screen. But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe. Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific -- Thank you -- That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook. I know. 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...' Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies. Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person! I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car. It's a perfectly good car. It runs. My clothes? Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way. Huh. Oh well. I guess I better leave then. Thank you. What? God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up! I'm not! I'm not! Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he? What does Clifford say? But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people! A rich actress. Who? You don't think I'm good enough? That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London. What's up? Oh. Where's Clifford? Hello, Harold. I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford. Who is she? Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me. GET OUT! You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here -- Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights? In my eyes, officer. You want his name? What night? No? Dick... Dick, I can't even breathe here... Dick, we need some time apart -- Showdown. ...Yes. Fired? Claire? Who? Sort of. Thank you, Harry. Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry. One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am? ...I see. You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here? No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better. ...Don't you? Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it. Thank you. Really? But I'll never win that. Thank you, Ralph. No. Never. No. ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one... I pity us, Dad. I pity us both. Daddy! You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please? Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you. Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again. I don't care, Dad. I love you. Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you? But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do? I know that, Dad, but -- ...So what do you think? I love you, Mama. I love you, Dad. If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it. Of course. What do I do, Dad? Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama -- And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- It's already started, Dad... with me. He's a socialist, then? Is Kaminski a Communist? He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble. Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York? I didn't have much to do with it. Thanks, Dad. See you next weekend, Dad. Oh, Kurt! But, Kurt, I... Kurt! Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch! Fifteen. I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am! Just one minute... Why, you... you little bastard! What is this? What? They'll mend. ...Not if I can help it. No, I don't hate it. I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you. Then don't go to Hollywood. Are you really serious? About acting? Are you an actor? I wouldn't miss it. You can always come see it in London. That would be okay. Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again. No, we're not. Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we? It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry? I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner. ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but... Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry... I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died? Well... you're looking well. How did I look? Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show? Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you. No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will. Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes. Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me? I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl. Yeah. I don't know. Oh Harry... I love you, Harry. I love you. ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig. Who? I got your number, Mister Man. I know. Don't tell anyone. Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess. Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy. What's that? I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand? You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me. Why are you always leaving me, Harry? To quarter-horses. What a man! Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch! You can't drink. Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you. You know something, Harry? No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all. Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama. A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers. I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe... I don't think I'd be much good in a war... ...Take advantage of me. This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone... I should've known... Where are we, mean man? Have I told you how mean you're turning, York? That sure looks like fun... You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel? Oh my God, I look awful. Who said I was a lady? Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze. I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good. No, Harry, I can't -- Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really? I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt. I took the early rounds. For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter. Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry. Help yourself. Everyone else has. What's left of my blood. How the hell do you find me anyway? Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it! Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that! Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter! I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard. Harry? Harry, where are you?! I know. He deserves a show. He missed the movie. It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving. The hell you will, Harry York. Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself. But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... I don't have what they want, Harry. Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving? No, they don't, do they? You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it. Forget it. Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something -- Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there -- Well, the studio told me not to. Yeah. Harry... I met someone. I know what ability you're interested in. Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now. You jackass! C'mon, let's get out of here. But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it? Jesus. Oh no... What? Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide. Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason? Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood? Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free. I thought we might go skinny dipping. For starters. What? Yeah. I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many... ...So you think I should go. What happened to him? Quietly. Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it... I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive. Don't be a rat, Harry. How'd I look? Well? What'd you think? Hi, Harry. Did you see the play? Harry. Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York. Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose. Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess. But I'm not. The newspapers're -- Whattaya mean? You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski... Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel! I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then? No... Actually, you look more like a cop. Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it. I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think? Okay then... Don't touch me. Shit! You know, I've never been able to figure that out. Yeah. Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until... Wherever they're going, I'm going. Yes. It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful... Fine! Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself. That's fine with me... Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury? Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face... I never saw him. Why didn't he show up? No, I couldn't get my hands on one. Who's writing this guy's lines? What? I live here. What happened? Who're you? Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it. You think I got it? How's it sound? 'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.' 'But how do I know you love me?' Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow! But I want to. I'm trying! I'm not! That's me, Clifford. And what's the title of this seduc... assault? No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all. Okay, boys, I'm ready. No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it! That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am -- Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to! But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame! You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me! Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath? I will, I promise. Thank you for understanding, Mama. No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning. No. No, it all depends on what offers I get. Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life. I'm going out! You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would. Mama, shut up! No! I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now! Haven't you heard what I said? Mama...? Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you. I'm back, Mama. Yes, Mama. Yes, Mama. I promise I'll... I promise, Mama. Sure. I'll be back. Not long. For a walk, Mama. Just a walk. Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile. I think I need a little air. Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song. Well, who have we here...? Go on... You kill me, Mama. Then why did you bring them? Why are these all opened? Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart! You're taking me home! Mama, what's... It's okay. I don't care. It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life. Oh, Mama, don't you understand? Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York. Yes, Ma. Mama... Oh bullshit. Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay. Don't I know you? Excuse me. Symington says... No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders... ...and your pencils... ...and your god-damn buttons... ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero! I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out! 'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass! Dr. Symington, how big is your dick? You what? Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty. I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all. Oh for Christ's... I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said... What? No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all. Not at all. She brought me my fan mail. I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake. Yes. It was very good to see her. You didn't say 'Symington says'. Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away. No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you? Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better... and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable... then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?" This whole thing is a joke! ...Did you really say that? Normal. Average. Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me. You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian. Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do? Oh! Are you really? Why, Doctor! We've only just met! It ain't for lack of trying. Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'. Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?No, my dear. You must be mistaken. I don't believe so. Yes...? On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound. As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due. Good. That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure. How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors! You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents -- You're poisoning that child's mind. When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer? Bread? I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent. But what -- I have! I was hoping for a kind word, little sister. Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway. You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back. Oh, just leave those things for now. Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind. Frances! You're not going anywhere! Where are you going? And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?! You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star! You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say. I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured! They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering! Don't... talk crazy. Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who -- I don't want you drinking, Frances. You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister. Say you promise. At one. Promise? I'll have lunch ready by one. How long will you be? Where are you going? What's wrong? Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy. Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles? What? It's your fan mail, little sister. Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now. And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that... Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am! Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need. It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine. Smile, little sister, smile. ...You will. Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles -- I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or -- But they're using you! And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself. Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand? I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe? A long time ago. Yes, Joe. Joe!I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid. Sid, there's no baby. But... but what would we do? Where would we go? You what? Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii. Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean... I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready? What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble. Let's just wait and see what happens. What other issue is there, Sid? What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you? What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility. I'm a little late, that's all. Then, I'll see you around. If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel. Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me. Like pick up some booze and go to a motel? Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards. Now what on earth would give you an idea like that? We don't have to talk at all. I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him. Vietnam? Is your brother a flyer? You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet? Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here? You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same! Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win? I do. No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us. Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...? I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you. You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant? Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack? You serious about having him over? You hope. No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come. Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?' But in what ways? What did he do? Did he do anything that was different? Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body. Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it? I got my foot on the floor. Come on. Let's go dance. See you in a month when you get liberty! Paula, look at the new Poopies. Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember. Come on, guys. It's five o'clock. Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula? Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles. That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period. I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me. Well, excuse me for livin'! God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?Yes I do! Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead! Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that! I don't know what it is. It could be anything. Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I... I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and... No! That's not true! God help you, Lynette! Lynette, where's Sid? No. I never feel like that. That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward. No way... Would you? What do you mean? I haven't made up my mind. He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it. I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number. He ask you out for next weekend? How did it go with you guys? Everything was different. Yeah... Mmmm... Great. Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight. That was you guys, huh? Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them. Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys. Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear. One more minute. Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either. However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself! I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term! Yeah. You got the whole story just right. Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you. Because he's my friend, too. I'd like to come with you. I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's! Why'd he do it? So? Sure. Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture. Call me during the week if you get the chance. Twenty-two years ago. Because my real father wouldn't marry her. For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with. Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks. Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family. So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola? That's okay. I'm used to it. I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here. Are those for me? When I'm good and ready. Zack, I don't know if I want to do that... I've seen all that a hundred times. What's the matter? I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show... Does it still hurt? God. Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want. I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act. You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly. They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water... I don't want you to move. Want me to get a towel? It sure was. Any time, sailor. Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear? I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough. Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy. To have a good time with you until you have to go. I know who you are and what you want. Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry? You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer! I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit! Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it! Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know. Where'd you learn to fight like that? He didn't give you much choice. I vote for the motel. Who cares? Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week. Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing. Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings? No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour. When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college. To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles. Not me. You got a girl? Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here? Really? Seriously. Where are you from, Mayo the Wop? Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials. But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control -- Will you please be quiet ! Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order? I still don't under -- En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened? Has something happened ? Do you read us? Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead. Is that a poem? The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I? How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father. David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy. Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely. Jim please -- ... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority... ... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...? ... taking Genesis away from us... ... Can't read you... repeat... Jim... read me? Can you read me? David. Please. This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food. I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan? You do that and you'll have murdered your father. Jim -- David -- Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event. Will you please be quiet! We must have order here. This has to be some sort of mistake. I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one. Maybe... Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring -- I know, I know... And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...What are you looking at? Oh, I believe it. The Admiral's son. Only half of you would get there. Aye, sir -- Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well. Admiral on the bridge! Understood, sir. Aye, sir. Three minutes, thirty seconds. Two minutes, ten seconds. Aye, sir. Power levels quite low, sir. All stop, sir. At what. That was close -- '... no uncoded messages on an open channel...' But the damage report -- we were immobilized... Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death... WHAT ? How? On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know. The Kobayashi Maru , sir. Admiral? Stage Two of what? It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless. That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied. Indeterminate life signs. Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.' On screen... Reliant's command... Who? Energize defense fields. Yes. Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical... May I ask how you dealt with the test? I failed to resolve the situation. I did not think so. I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating. May I speak, sir? It is still regulation, Admiral. As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me. ... No, sir. It has not. Because... there was no way to win. I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities. Permission to speak candidly, sir? Any suggestions, Admiral? We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space. Prepare for warp speed. Course heading, Captain? Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu. We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here. Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission... I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister. Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone. You lied. By the book... Aye, sir. Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est -- Aye, sir. Never, sir. All moorings are clear, Captain. Aye, sir. He's very human. He's not what I expected, Sir. Fire all phasers...!Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond! Nothing, sir. I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please -- ... No response, sir. Admiral -- Mr. Scott on discrete. I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system. Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant. She's not responding... I'm trying, sir. Stand by...Does that mean I'm back for awhile? What does it mean? Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office... ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that. It looks that way. Mickey told him to call. 'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.' ...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office... ...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy... Mickey told me to come back to work.After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine. Or else, or else, he said... He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse... I thought I would need it. Because I kept a copy. I have it right here. Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure. That's not my handwriting. I do. Yes. They lied. I... I... yes. I... Yes. Yes. Yes. No. I wouldn't do it. It's a crime. Yes. I did. Yes. She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital. Yes. Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name. Yes. Yes. Yes... I used to be a nurse. Mrs. Simmonds. Who told you that? Thank you. How old is he? You live in the neighborhood? Hi.I have to talk to you. What are you going to do? Is it over? Yes. We've all got to let go. You're pressuring yourself... Joe... Joe... What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure. What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your... Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you! You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school... Not if you don't grow up... Maybe I'll tell you later. You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place. You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it? I thought it's not over till the jury comes in. You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself? Well, then what are you doing here? And it's over...? You're talking like a drunk. Isn't there something you... Yes. You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on... Why don't you get some rest? Do you want me to go...? ...and is that serious? What happened...? Is this a bad time. Would you like me to leave...? Is this a bad time -- ? And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...? Maybe what? And are they going to get it? I think I will. What if it wasn't you that I came back to see? Laura. Who says I'm the one that called it off? Yes. It was, actually. My ex-husband was a lawyer. And what are you? A cop? The TV didn't work. I changed my room at the Hotel. Still looking. Me, too. Huh. The Big Boy did...? Yes. Should I? How'm I doing so far?Well, maybe you better do that, then. You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores. You know, you're pushy, fella... I don't owe them a goddamn thing. Who says that I'm protecting anyone? I didn't do it, Mister. And ask me what? Nothing happened. I've got nothing to say to you. ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me? No. I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...Are we going to win? We have, you know, other tactics, though... What does it mean? I... I mean we, you have other tactics... We just can't do it anymore. This is our chance to get away. He saw her at the Northern Care... ...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right. My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue... I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will... You know how beautiful she was? Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment. ...You saw her? But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her... ...we, we love her, Dick and me... It's locked.Okay, Chewie, it's now or never. Chewie, head for the bottom of the city. ... the power? I don't care. It would've been worth it .... for Han. We should have stayed and finished them off. What happened? ... I love you. I couldn't tell you before, but it's true. I'm worried about all of us. I can't figure out what they're up to. No thanks. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Something's wrong here. Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him. I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right. Has Threepio turned up yet? You look silly. What are you staring at? I don't like this. You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them. Can you trust him? A mining colony. Never heard of that system. You keep logs? My, how organized. That depends. Where are we? Not bad, hot shot, not bad. Then what? What'd you have in mind for your next move? I'm still not sure what you've accomplished. You could have warned him before you shut him off. You're going to attack them?!!! No lightspeed? The entrance is collapsing! But the tremors have stopped. Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed. You can't make the jump in this asteroid field. Looks like some kind of Mynock. Are you crazy! Outside, in the cave. There's something out there! I do not! There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized. Don't count on it. I happen to like nice men. Afraid of? Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy. Stop that. Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Yes, you do. Would you please stop calling me that? Where have I heard that before? They're moving away. Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser. I don't expect anything, except to be left alone. Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited. How do I look? Very funny. You can let go now .... I'm getting angry. What is it? Now you're making sense. I'm against that. Good. I take it back. To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field? Probably an asteroid field .... Or you ran into something .... I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried. I'll be surprised if we ever start moving. This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. Would it help if I got out and pushed? Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures. Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder. You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind. I don't know what he's talking about. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from. An Imperial probe droid. What was it? Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him. Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ... And you think you're the one to apply some heat? We are fighting for a cause much ... I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee. I respect you. You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about. And what are they, pray tell? Me? I don't know what you mean. Yes. Han, we need you here. Does Luke know? You said you were going to stay. What happened? That sounds familiar. Are the coordinates set? It's Luke. Get under him. Slow down. Easy Chewie. Line up your tracking system. Lando, open the hatch. No argument, just do it. That's a command! Luke needs help. We must go back. Luke! What'd you say? We've got to find Luke. You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy. What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ... You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life. Chewie's right. We must try to save Han. We have no use for your kind. And when do you betray us again? What's going on? ... we're the bait. What about Han? It's a lovely outpost. You're part of the mining guild then? Thanks. Not really. You may call me Leia. Two transports at a time is awfully risky. What is it? Have they analyzed the one that was killed? Is there any chance of them surviving out there? I understand. Let's go. I thought you knew this person. Well, what now? What?? A tremor! Closer?! You don't have to do this to impress me. I'll be back later. You rest now. This hyperdrive had better work. Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there? How's Luke? Luke, no! It's a trap. I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures. He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to. First Han, now you. When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ... That's just great. Why doesn't everyone just take off? Where are you going? What did you say?! Me too. I was afraid. The Bacta are growing well. The scars should be gone in a day or so. Does it still hurt?Have you ever made love in a hammock? Your bed. You go ahead... What are they saying? I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't. It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs. Sort of. Could we move a little faster? When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late. My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me. I was so upset... I told them I slept with you. My mothers slapped me. That was the first time she'd ever hit me. I couldn't believe it. I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying. They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that. I decided to hide out all night. They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me. The woods were cold and damp from the rain. I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep. All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps. I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark. I couldn't see anything. I heard a cracking noise behind me. I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man. So grotesque he was almost inhuman. He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again. I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away. I ran and ran, but he kept coming. He was big but so fast. He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me? Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground. I was kicking and yelling. He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods. Oh, please... please... You promised you'd never ask me. I'm trying. I'm really trying. I'm here with you. Can't that be enough for now? ... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am. The quiet can fool you. It fooled me. You can never be sure of what's out there. It's deceiving. Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset. It'll mellow you out. No. I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs. Are you all right, Shelly? I'm serious. Doesn't this look a little strange to you? Somebody was in here. Did you stay here last night? Nothing. This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it? Just slow down. Let me get to know you again. Let me get to know this place again. I don't know. You haven't changed a bit. Always so sure of yourself. Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you. You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters. You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that. Derek... stop.Sure. What? Barely. I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime. I vote for the hammock. That was the best yet. Was it you... me... or the hammock? Think you can figure it out? First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you... How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around? You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house. Not now. I'm cold. What're you doing? We'd be all alone. We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see. Why don't we go take a swim? What was that? No way. We're pregnant. Remember? Cool it, Andy. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. A hammock? What's this? Come on down! I don't know. I flunked Spanish. Okay, we won't. We'll just have fun, all agreed? Which one is it?You're wrong. I never said you were "nothing". I do like you. But not when you act like a jerk. You don't "have to." Why do you do these stupid things?! Damn you, Shelly! Don't say any more. We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault. We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang... ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways. This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country. Bullseye! You're the boss. What're you doing? This is no time to celebrate! Got any good ideas? Keep looking. Stop worrying. I don't think they'll bother to come after us. See anything? Yes. May be please have the wallet. Everything's gonna be fine. Come on, Shelly. Who else is gonna give him a lift? Why don't you help us? Destroy the evidence, Pronto! In that little thing? What d'ya got in there? You're Shelly?"I will follow you in all our vows and duties." "I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people." God gave you ten thumbs. Please! You're being foolish! I am your wife. It is the work of untouchables. Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine. Mr. Khan said they called you brave. Are you sure? They are boys. -- And they're Indian. As I told you about English policemen.Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly. Chinese food? Hostess? Stripper? That's nice. I know. Fine. Fine.For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing. Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me? But... Charlie...I've got to see you. I want to talk... The building on the corner. That one! He's been on the roof a half hour now! The green capsules in the top drawer. I'm sleepy. Ummmmmmmmmmmmm. I can take care of myself. You know that. You know why...with my parents. I'm going to take that apartment uptown. You're intolerable today. Sure...He lives there? I know you don't. You've been very preoccupied lately. It was nothing. I'm almost finished. A paper on that one too? Ok. C'mon Charlie...one more day. I'll call in sick for work. It's still sick. It doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal. No. Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night? What is it now? Anything specific? Charlie...? An apartment uptown? Downtown? It's all right. I don't mind. Please take it. Here. Do you have enough? I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.I don't think I'm cleared for this. Flynn! For being on to Dillinger. That Dillinger's on to him. To warn him. I mean I want both of us to go. I want to go to his place. Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it. Flynn had Group 7 access. Did he say why? Did you say Group 7 access? How's it going upstairs? You're getting out of the business? Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous. As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here... Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office. Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does.. I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to. You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old. Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system? We have to talk.
