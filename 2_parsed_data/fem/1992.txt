What is it, now? Tell me... I am busy inside. They took everything... They tried... but I didn't let them. You don't usually ask. That's something you can't decide. I'm not asking you to swear to anything. Thank God... I find that hard to believe. I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here! Well... that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving... I know.There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this? But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent. Do they have such thoughts? How old are you, Senor Colon? A woman? You show no inclination to speak otherwise! I cannot ignore the verdict of my council. That she was impregnable. The ocean is uncrossable? I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no. But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool. Because he is not afraid of me. I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence. And who would you think of, for such a task? Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez? Is this true, Brother Buyl? We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we? We must have faith. We must give time for time. Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it? Call him back! You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted. Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track? "The Strawberries"? But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread... Who? Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you. First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that... First time shooting up? Then c'mere. I got something for you. C'mere. You got some good blow, right? Who? Why? OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God? You believe that man is the be-all and end-all? That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins. I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God? It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ. Susie's not a virgin anymore. I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't. Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant... It's nothing. This is New York, man... Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money! I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!He wants to know who brought in the chalice. Are you all right, honey? Yes. Yes.Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed. Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys. Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina. As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father -- I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God? Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God? Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.Okay. Nice meeting you. No... but I can tell. A woman knows these things. I know he really likes you. Do you like my dad? Boys. Not really. It's pretty boring. He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back. Would you like come in? Uh huh. Who's Kathy? But you promised. You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today. You ready? Thanks, David. What is it, dad? No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio. Mrs. Lutz. She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world. Okay. That has nothing to do with it. I can't sleep. My beds lumpy. Congratulations, dad.Through a rental agency. Ten days ago. You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her. Coming home at all hours of the night. A young girl new to the city. This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm! It isn't him. Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this. Remember eventually revenge is carefully... Have you tired juxtaposing the words? He was with me? It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it. Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious. What do you mean, stand out? A few people. Maybe you're reaching a bit? I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him. Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today? He's one of the best Chess players in the world. Who better to play a game with? You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone? I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down. Put it down, David. I know, but this isn't going to bring her back. Yes, I do. I found your file. I know what happened. This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead. You can't undo it. Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't? What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here? Come here. Why did he? He already did once. I'm just nervous. Sorry. How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before. This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history. I just can't believe it. Fuck off! Don't patronize me! You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me! --the same type as the girl who got killed. Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath. You could have been honest with me for starters. We work together. I have to be able to trust you. Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we? You're damn right! I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer! Nice meeting you. How do you know that? Did he say something? Of course. That's only because you don't know where to go. You like hiking? Fishing? Sailing? What do you like? So, are you having a good time on the Island? Is your dad here? I'm Kathy. You must be Erica. I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late. No. He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist. It was Peter. You don't have a shred of evidence! This stinks! You want to know what I think? I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice. And what if he's wrong. If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him. If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message. What does that mean? What are you saying? That I'm seeing what I want to see? That I'm protecting a murderer? What? About a quarter to one. As large as castles. Each of those grids represents almost a square mile. He moves around a lot. Why? I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end? Well, I think you have to play to his ego. He thinks he's superior. The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take. Peter's right, Captain. He's got to be forced into making a mistake. I know that. I've seen the photo's. His home would be... Mount Olympus. Meaning? I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next? Yes. Why disguise your voice if no one knows it? That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy. Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them. Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it. But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around. Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim. But we heard him. --Edmonds. I know. You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you? I see you're still having problems with your openings. I'm busy right now. What do you think he did? Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on. What'd he do? I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic. What's this all about anyway? Well what? I told you this was a stupid idea. You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes. What are they, please? Could you please do me a big favor? In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess. Could you look and tell me what they are? Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard. I called you earlier about a book. Thank you. I'm at 639-7393. Hi, Sara. This is Doctor Sheppard. I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger. I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future. There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you. You made a difference. You beat him. Yeah. I'll be there later. You're going to be late for your match. Of course not. He didn't tell you either. No he didn't. How did you know it was "carefully"? It could be anything. Maybe you're afraid of what it says. Why not? Why? Of course it isn't. It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident. Then help me to understand. I want to understand. You're wife died. You can't feel responsible for that. That's still no excuse. You treat everything like a game. Peter... I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you. I'm not looking for an apology, Peter. Hi. Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid? What? But what does he mean by a fierce magazine? Violent? For emphasis? Peter... Peter, you have to admit-- Nothing. I tried again and got through. They're not delivering. I'm going to go pick up the pizza. The line was busy. I'll try again. Would you settle for pepperoni? What do you want on it? I'm hungry. You can turn everything around so easily. This is not just another game, is it? I said I didn't plan on getting involved. You've got to face the things you feel. Then show me who you are. Does anyone? Nobody could attack you. You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses. You're cut off from everyone around you. I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter. Yes you are. You're playing word games. Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games. And you? It must've been very hard on Erica? I'm sorry. I dunno. Where's Erica mother? No. You were talking about chess. You always want to talk about me. What about you? I'm sure you are. Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it? Because I think he's wrong. No. You know, Andy thinks you're doing this. How could you? Unless you were there. How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw. No -- I'm not involved. And I plan on keeping it that way. No. Because I work with them. Of course. You have to win every point, don't you? You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did. That's not fair! I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level. Let's change the subject. Of course. That's true -- but the emotion is still there. They just learn to control it. How can you look at it so clinically? This isn't a game. Another kind of game? Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face? You sound like my mother. I don't think I could. What if she isn't? Where are your priorities? You have to think between someone's life and a chess game? The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old! He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage! She could be dead after the game. But you're the key. The one he wants to play the game with. We need your help. They couldn't break the riddle. Nothing. I just came in for a steam. Well, I think I've had enough. Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian. You. Do you always open quickly? I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess. Are you disappointed that I won't answer you? That's a very personal question. --but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control. Sounds very violent. It seems like such a complicated game. I've always wanted to learn how to play chess. I don't have the patience for it. When did you start playing? Are you one of the players? Are you with the tournament? Because I love them, but they drive me crazy. You know how parents are? I love this hotel. I stay here every time I visit my parents. Is this your first time here? It's alright.What's the first street? What are you talking about? It'll take hours. You can't make me do this. You want me to what?"Carefully". "Carefully". "Carefully". Of course. Yes, here it is. Why, they're all the same? Yes, Doctor Sheppard. We called you back but you weren't home. We have the book. Bainbridge Books. We'll call you back. I can check and call you back. Bainbridge Books.I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow? Dear heart, where are you? Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop? Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Dear heart, I love you. Shhh! Get some sleep. Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us. We need you too! Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home? Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind? What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance. A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture. Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!! No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own. To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend? "Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..." "Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..." We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more. The talk is everywhere! We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it. I'm not made of glass. Because you're in trouble. The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you. I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore. You're with me even when you're away. Hush your mouth. Just hold me. Yes. Did you eat? Yes I did. Did you hear my answer? Yes. I know. Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife. And dogged when I set my mind to something. There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain. But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man. If it's just idle, I won't answer it. Why do you ask? You have enough worries of your own. I can handle it. Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure. There's nothing to talk about. How do you like it? What? You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad. Could we sit down someplace? I see your point. Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork. That you haven't time for either marriage or eating -- Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage? If you want to tell me. She ate.Let him finish. Entirely. You put it very well. Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate? Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day. If she got eyes, she do. 'Bout every other night, Red. You know that gal? And like a fool I believe it. I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her. I do know I love you. Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart. What for? I ain't white and I don't put out. I know where you're going. I ain't stupid. 'Lo. I've got to freshen up.If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting. Did you hear me?! Get out. These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None. Murder.You'll regret this, Mrs. Little. Your control over your children, therefore -- All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief. I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness. -- there is a serious question as to whether -- It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class. He's bright. This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother. This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want. Yes sir. Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.You had the number. Baby, I was gonna give it to you. Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot. Me? You evil this morning. You the man. Sweetie, they're almost ready. You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie? That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run. ...That isn't a whore?Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy. Your relatives must've taught you something. You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place. In your eyes, that's power. -- You desecrated it, it had to be burned. Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is. Thank you. I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray. Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again. You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here? -- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him. Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this? You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine. You're the Indian FBI.Why do you do it, Laura? But I love you, Laura. Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me? How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed? How did the car get back here? I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long. They all knew you at that place. You're not mad at me? Laura, I am your friend. I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember? I won't wear your stuff. I promise. Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff? No. I don't need to take this to be your friend. What are you doing? If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead. Dancing. Where are the Cookies? Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink? Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend. Where are you going? Goodbye, Muffin. You want a muffin? This is about sex, not like. Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins. You want a muffin? I'm in a mess today, too. I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think? Do you want to talk? Okay, L. I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight. No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are. Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life? What is it Laura? What's wrong? Of course... Laura? Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner. Call me. Maybe I better start our homework. Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster? Sweet? God, he's gorgeous. Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon. James is the one. He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love". Oh god, Laura. You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you? Are you going to see James tonight? Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable. You know what your problem is? You're just too adorable... Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"? Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting? The usual, 9:15. James called me last night looking for you. You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen. Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the... You didn't do your homework?Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking. I just thought I ought to tell you. You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead. I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident". No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs. No. There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again. Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister. She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with -- Jack and I are united in holy matrimony. Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?I understand. Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry? Fish eyes? I don't want to offend the customs of your country. That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.No. Never. You'll have to kill me. No. Who are you? Who are you REALLY? NO! GOD, NO... Go away. I am not talking to you. No... No, go away. Thanks, Bobby. And my little round friends, too. Bobby... Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow. Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow. I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out. What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative? Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative. What was? You killed Mike. Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike. Here he comes. Don't be late. Thank you, Bobby. A big score? I'm nearly out. Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles. Get lost Bobby. I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around. If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down. Cause I like it. And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff. All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me. I can't help you there. WE got it back, that's all. What can I tell you? No. I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it. No, you should forget about last night. Not you, Donna, not you. Jacques, help me get her home. NOW! Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never. YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!! Nothing. Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow. You mean Fred and Ginger? Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike? No place, fast. And you're not coming. No, you're the muffin. Donna, you are a muffin. If I can smoke it. Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight. No, I want to smoke. You know, even when I think about your face I get happier. Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D. I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute... Donna, are you my best friend? Sure. What do you want me to call you? Okay, I suppose I should go home. Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever. James is very sweet and very gorgeous. Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna? Well, why not? Maybe. Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time. I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable. You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable. I don't know what to do. No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him. He probably wanted to drive over. When? Thanks. Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough. Noooo... If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick. He's in love with a girl who's dead. It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry. I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid. You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are. Oh, yes... yes... He wants to be me... or he will kill me. The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me. Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12. The pages are gone. That's real. Bob. My secret diary. There are pages missing. I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight. I already made you two tapes. I'm not. I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here. Let's go all the way. Buy me a ticket to The Great Went. What? She asked about my father? I am The Muffin. Hey, Jacques... Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now. You want to see... Bobby killed a guy. When he finds out. Shit, maybe he'll kill you. I do love you. Let's get lost together. You mean the ones you pity. "Oh, Laura..." Everything, but everything. You know it and I know it. That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James? I just can't, James. I can't do it. I can't tonight. Okay. Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today. Not now. James... How can I be together if I'm not together? You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't. Gobble, gobble, gobble. James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn. No, it doesn't... just kiss me. Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter. Okay. James... Good night, Mom. If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework. Where's Dad? I hate asparagus. Mom, take it easy. Mom... what are you wearing? I'm sorry, Mom. I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand. What were you doing in my room? What? I forgot my books at school. Can I take the car? NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME. KILL ME. NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME. Stay away from me. I was down the street. Oh, I thought I saw you. Did you come home during the day last week? Dad? Are you sure you're okay? Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset. No. Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him? A friend from school. Dad... Not really. ...school's fine... Fine. But my name isn't Leland Palmer. Dad.Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo. Come back as soon as you can. There's no one here. What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway. You're not busy, sweetheart, now go. Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?Good night, sweetheart. It's a school night... back by nine. Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians. Sure you do, it's good for you. My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god. Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again? Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving. Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand. I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go? You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed. Laura. Sure honey, what's the hurry? Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner. Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it. How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that? They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland. Leland... Leland, what are you doing? Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change. Oh, Leland.Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work... As if I didn't know. Lay off the bennies, Leo. If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels". Norma, are you alright? You're right. There's no one here. Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it? I'm kind of busy, Norma.What's wrong? I don't know. What are you doing? I can arrange that. I like that. When's the next business trip, big fella?What? I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here. Where is he? What are you doing here? She's evil. She's brilliant. Be careful, Nick. I got married. He was on staff at the clinic. I was down in Salinas. It didn't... last long. She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is. You're a good cop -- what did she do? Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant? Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it. She's really sick you know. Don't you know what she's doing? She knows I went to Berkeley. She knows I knew Noah. She makes up that story about me. She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her. I had him in two classes. I did dye my hair. It didn't have anything to do with her. I was a redhead for a while, too. I slept with her once in school. I was just a kid. I was experimenting. It was just that one time. She developed a... fixation... on me. She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did. It scared me. She told you, didn't she? What do you want, Nick? I know the type. I'm a psychologist. My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates -- Yes you do. Something's on with you. You're sleeping with her, aren't you? What is your problem? I'm trying to help you. Why won't you let me help you? Yes you did. I'm a big girl. I can handle it. I hardly knew her. She gave me the creeps, though. I don't know why. She must really be something. From a clinical point of view. How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports? It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports. Yes. I care about you. I did it for you. Sometimes I really hate you. Nilsen. No, Nick, please -- It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall. She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall. What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you? I thought you quit. We were in some of the same classes. Catherine Tramell. What was she like? Baby-sitting. Rookie cop. You don't look so okay. You okay? Yes. How's not smoking? No? How about the coke? How about the booze? How is your -- personal life? So -- how are things? I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay? As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose. Sit down, Nick. How are you, Nick?I hate rugrats. What do we do now, Nick? The games are over. You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter. What do you want, Nick? Flowers? I'll send you some flowers. I told you. She kills him. I finished my book. Somebody always does. Somebody has to die. It won't sell. What happens to them? Really. What are you writing about. What are you researching? I'm very good at research. I'll help you. Come over here and tell me no. Did you miss me? I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you. Liar. You still think I kill people, don't you? You're not going to tell me what she's doing. I thought we weren't playing games anymore. Did you? What's she doing? I just thought I'd surprise you. What's the matter? Of course I knew. Honey, why don't you go in the car? I'll be right there. Funny. What did he say? I'll convince you. Do you believe me? Maybe I'm losing interest in my book. I would've paid more. I wanted to know everything about you. Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better. I'd read about your shootings in the papers. I decided to write a book about a detective. I wanted to know my character. About three months before I met you. I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file. You won't believe me. No more games, Nick. I'm tired of playing games! No. I never have before. No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited. I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college. I slept with her once. She started following me around, taking my picture. She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman. It was awful. For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me. Make love to me. Everybody that I care about dies. Do you think I told her to kill You? I should have known. I came into the house when you were down on the beach. She looked at me so strangely. She left right after you. I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time. She tried to kill you, didn't she? You're in over your head. You shouldn't play this game. I told you I had a vivid imagination. Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets? I don't do those. Fine. How's your back? Do you want her to join us sometime? I thought it was a pretty good beginning. Did you think it was so special? She's seen everything before. I'm leaving the house around midnight. In case you're going to follow me. I'm going down to Johnny's club. I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character. Why take the risk? Good. I'd miss you. You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore. You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you? No. I wrote it years afterwards. You mean did I write it before my parents died? To see if he can get away with it. A boy kills his parents. They have a plane. He makes it look like an accident. Aren't you going to thank me? Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?" It's not the same thing, is it? Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately. You don't have any coke, do you? I love coke and Jack Daniel's. Cheers. My friends call me Catherine. I know, Nicky, but I like it. What if I call you Nicky? Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter? Please. Fine. Not me. Why not? You're not easy to figure. I'm just very good at figuring. Do you? I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me. I have attorneys. They have friends. I have friends. Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends. Yes, you did. They never tested you, did they? But Internal Affairs knew. What happened, Nick? Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much? Only in theory. You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter? Not in theory -- in practice. Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse. Noah was my counselor in my freshman year. That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick. For my book. Funny how the subconscious works. Hazel is my friend. There's a name from the past. Four shootings in five years. All accidents. I don't know. But you do. I'd like to ask you some, too. Would you like a drink? I was just going to have one. No. Come in. You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick? You know all about me. You see? We're both innocent, Nick. Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. For my writing. If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring. It wouldn't be tiring at all. I'm tired. Thanks. You still get the pleasure. Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick? That's right. No. I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game. I loved him. I hurt. I've got a degree in psych. It goes with the turf. Games are fun. Yes it does, doesn't it? No. I said I liked Johnny to use his hands. I don't give any rules, Nick. I go with the flow. I have nothing to hide. Did I miss something? A detective. He falls for the wrong woman. It won't last. I found some in my purse; would you like one? Yes, you do. Do you have a cigarette? Only when they make interesting reading. Are you arresting me? No. I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night. No. We had a drink at the club. We left together. I came here. He went home. Yes. Yes. About a year and a half. I wasn't dating him. I was fucking him. I know who you are. I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer. I'm not stupid. No. Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan. I had sex with him for about a year and a half. I liked having sex with him. What are you going to do? Charge me with smoking? No thank you. I'm a writer, I use people for what I write. You write what you know. Let the world beware. In the beginning. Then I got to like what he did for me. Cocaine. Sometimes. The answer is no. I didn't kill him. You make it up, but it has to be believable. They call it suspension of disbelief. It teaches you to lie. Yes I am. Why would I need an attorney? Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown. I don't really feel like talking anymore. Really. Maybe that's why you're from Homicide. How? How did he die?She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse. The razor just happened to be there. You're looking for Catherine, not me. Is he dead? What do you want? He died -- about five or six years ago. Only if you're making it. No Lisa Anderson, detective. Yes I did. Anderson. Jack W. Donald M. I'm sorry. No Lisa. Fourteen. We seal juvenile records until they're deceased. That's why you didn't find it in your computer. I'm Roxy. I'm her -- friend. You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you? Are you vice?Don't be naive. The law doesn't apply to people like him! Or us -- Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful. You're the second man who killed me this week. But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left. But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it. Hey stud: I thought we had something together. I can't sleep either, lately. A little link, between us. But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it. That could put a strain on our relationship. Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em? Good joke. Wanna hear another one? As I was saying: I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted. Are you listening, you Batman you? How could you? I'm a woman... Where's the fire? You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me. Three lives down. Got enough bullets to finish me off? He is Batman, you moron. Sorry, Max. A die for a die. A half-pint. I'm talking gallons. Your blood, Max. Me, domesticated? By you? I doubt it! You repulsive... awful... penguin . Did I? Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men -- Corn dog! I wouldn't touch you to scratch you. I want in. The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty. Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ... He napalmed my arm. He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation. You're off the hook, Ozzie. But Batman is decidedly not . You're quick. Mayor Cobblepot. He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most. Meaning, us. I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat. Batman. The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment. Down, Oswald. We have to talk. You see we've got something in common.My lips are sealed. Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command. Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal... All is shrill, all is blight... ... eight, seven... Ten, nine...... What do we do? A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ... I don't know anymore, Bruce ... Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will. Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top? When he should be six feet under? You first. Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ... There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding. What say we ... 'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat. Nor I, on the second. It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least they're commited. Well? Was "Vicki" right? About your difficulty with duality? Sure. "Vicki." Ice-skater, or stewardess? And the truth frightened her? What went wrong? Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her. Executive Assistant. Secretary. Girlfriend? I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale? Yes and no... "We"? You and... Yeah? Me too... No darker than yours, Bruce. I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too. -- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight. You're not coming to that, are you? "The Relighting of the Tree" thing? I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds." How do these hacks sleep at night? The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least. Treat to be here. Scare me? No, actually, I was just scaring myself ... Oh. "Kyle." Pouring myself into my work. I'm listed. Well that's a ... long story ... You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck. Yes and no ... You mean mistook me ? Have we? Actually I have to split. Take a "personal day." You don't mind? Max, you're tops. Morning, Max. Bummer about the store. You insured? That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one. Okay, go ahead. Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big. I mean, it's not like you can just kill me. It's our secret. Honest. How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless? Too good? I'm no cat. I'm just an assistant. A secretary -- Big giant capacitor . And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be -- -- sucking power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of? Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say. Well I figured that your password was "Finster." Your Pomeranian. And it was. And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant... No, I am. Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning. I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --I don't know. But the boy, he couldn't kill them. I look horrible. I had him in my grasp. My arm! He took my fucking arm! I don't think this is gold.Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons. Thanks. Have you seen Jeffrey? Don't grab me, okay? He's got a... What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code. Andy! Nice game. Guys. Guys! Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago. Hi, guys. Dying. Don't tread on the earth? Guys. The environment. I'm telling you, it's totally key. The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it. Probably. What movie is this? Yeah, I guess. What's playing there? I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby. Maybe. Yeah? Uum... around ten? You left me a message? You broke up with my machine? No, you didn't. When? I don't understand. I thought we were meeting here. Jeffrey. Projectile vomit. I can take care of myself, Jeffrey. 'Bye. I went to sleep. I think I have the flu or something. I do? I guess I do. Jealous? Hi. Nothing. It was just a dream. Nothing. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Mmmnkay. Oh. Who's in it? I know what it is. It's what's on instead of the movie. What show is this? Something like that. Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby. I... yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine. I am so sure. No... I think you've forgotten something. Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert? We've come all this way. We just have to check it out. I got a hunch. Don't be such a fraidy-cat. Get away from me! Good thing one of us was prepared. You're staying here. Some of them might not come after me. If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain. I'm going out the front. I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice. I'm glad you came. Pretty shallow of you. Leave me alone. Right. I'm the chosen one. And I choose to be shopping. He did what he was supposed to. I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore. It's not a mixer. It's the senior dance. And it's important. You wouldn't understand. In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende? I'm going to the dance. I'm going to the senior dance. For the dance. A dress. I'm going shopping. Don't try to stop me. Merrick... Oh, God. It's him. I think it's him. Pike, I don't think you're up to this. Thanks. Why'd you come back? I didn't expect to see you. Yeah? Mmkay. You sure? I'm kinda beat. You can stay in my mom's room if you want. It's weird. I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place. I couldn't even fit on the swings. Everything just looked so small. I'm sorry. I'm babbling. Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything. I definitely didn't expect this. Things are kind of confusing. It's nothing. It doesn't hurt. Where are you gonna go? Well, stay here tonight. You had a car full of stuff. Were you leaving? Yeah. Not exactly. You want some water or something? How are you doing? Is that your car? Hi. Buffy. You guys are thrashed. It could happen. Like my homework. You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework. Bogutude. Blow it off. Bugs. See, Cassandra likes it. Cassandra's my friend. It has to be, like a socially conscious theme. You look way pretty, Kim. I'm glad you guys are here. It's good to see you. Listen to you. What language are you speaking? Kimberly, it's a dance. It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day. Excuse me for having something important to do. Look, a lot's been going on. That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you. You see... a while ago, I met this guy -- I forgot. Get a boob job. I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal. Kimberly, it's the senior dance. Where? 'Just remember you're in training, son' Excuse much! Not rude or anything. Sounds toasty. We're going Pavilion. Please. They show previews for foreign movies. Why don't we see a movie? ) What do you think? He knows who I am! And where are they now? You're learning. Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning. Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan. Toasty. You should come; it's gonna be a great game. I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore. Come on, Merrick. Football. Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left. Why because it's not my fate? It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game? Make time, okay? You're the one who told me to act normal. I've missed three practices already. If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk. I kind of had to improvise. Sorry about your guitar. Okay. The important thing is not to panic. Well, you're on my turf now. You're just gonna have to trust me. Because you clash, Merrick. You clash with everything. I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.' Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena. We call them zippers. They're not supposed to be a challenge. I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean? Lately it bugs me, I guess. Merrick? Are you still breathing? Merrick. You made a joke. Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down? I know it hurts the first time. Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one. Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy. I've got a few things the other girls didn't have. And it makes it worse when I die, right? I'm curious, is all. I wish you would. Watchers? How can you keep doing this? So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right? Five? I... Oh, fuck you! And why are you always wearing black? It's so down. It's totally not your color. I don't think you have a color. Aren't I, like the chosen one? The one and only? The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me? Like, ever? A wet! Didn't I just kill that vampire? I think I did. I didn't see you killing any vampires. You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'. You are such a wet. Oh, wonderful. My secret weapon is - PMS. That's just great. Thanks for telling me. Nice conversationalist! Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject. Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you? Fine. What!?! Oh. They were vampires? My nails. If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person? Toasty. Were there ever any, like, famous vampires? What about bats? Do they turn into bats? Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par. No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you. Put your head back. Oh. Sorry. Last night. You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you? I don't want to be the chosen one, okay? I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires! I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die. It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell. And then you come along... and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me! But you threw a knife at my head! Oh, what the hell is wrong with you? You threw a knife at my head! No. You don't do anything. I do it. No -- you don't have to -- Who we gonna beat? Okay. Here? Sporting events, yeah. Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler. Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky. I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs? They're like -- -- the mighty oak. It's not a look. Uh... gym. Not a pressing issue. Great. First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate. Hey, do I have to take notes on this? I still don't get how they happened to come to my town. I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here? That Lothos guy, and his buddies? What? Oh, him. A Vampire-King? You mean like Dracula? Why do you keep saying that? What, um... What do we do? Our purposes. They can't come in, right? Unless you invite them. Is that true? I have cheerleading squad. All right. She -- All right. What do we do now? Wait a minute. None of your business. God. Ow. Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida. I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night. How do you know all this? I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar. And I... was fighting. I'm always fighting. And there's a guy... He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me. Oh, my God. I never told anybody about this. I remember the one about the peasant, too. God, there's a bunch. Is this, like channeling or something. I don't know. It was... There was a big gram or something. And there's one, I'm like a prostitute... I was a slave. Everybody does. Just stay away from me, okay? Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots? Let me get this straight. You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires. Time to do what? Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay? You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you. My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy. Wait a minute. My birthright is in the graveyard? Later not. I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes. My birthright? You mean, like a trust fund? Why? What are you talking about? Am I in trouble or something? What? Oh. I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone? God, where the hell did you come from? You scared me to death. Oh. Have you guys seen Jeffrey? The limo never showed, I thought he might be here. Hi, guys. Nicole... Pike. Sorry. Thanks. B'bye. Don't worry, Jennifer. Someday your prince will come. Yeah... She's okay, though. You guys blow. I'm waiting on Cassandra. She's gonna help me with my history. How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to. Nobody is even gonna look at the game. That is so cool. I was just scared is all. What, it's not weird. I just cut the stupid hot dog in half. Cassandra, you gotta come, too. That's the plan. No THX. Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador. Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway. Ooh! Mr. Howard is so heinous. He's always giving me a hard time. I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.' I have no sense of history? He wears a brown tie.Aren't we the chatty ones. Kiss noise. What's Bobby gonna say? Have you gained a few pounds? Maybe it's that outfit... Buffy, honey? Do you know what time it is?Like what? I really can't. Besides, it's pretty interesting. Can't. History report. The Normans and the Saxons. Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer? It is a pretty crucial subject. 'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.' Swear to God. No, wait. I can be dumb. Really. Or mean, or whatever. I can learn. I'm useful. What... are you? My parents have money... What's happening? What do you want?I'm just a girl. I don't understand. Why? Why me? I can't!He doesn't look fifty. Hi, Buffy. Eeyuu. Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'. You know, and a picture of the earth. Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing? Oh, my God. Is that true? My mom doesn't go anywhere. She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin. Your parents are always going away for the weekend. You're so lucky. Excellent. She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school. All year. She didn't even go to the prom. But -- No -- Jeffrey! Make me a woman! Yes! Make me a woman! Oh, yes! Yes! Okay, what else? She was even crazier after that. I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her. And Spring Fling. I got all the plastic stuff. What should I do with it? Probably was. What do you suppose she was doing out there. So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels. Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something. Like dealing. Where'd you learn how to do that? Does Jeffrey know? What is she... I never thought of that. Oh, my God! Ouch! No wonder you quit. You're kidding. What happened? Omniplex?I know. I like your little outfit. Yeah, whoops I came. Get out of my facial. This isn't important? The earth is our home. Oh my God you're having an affair. Buffy, what is your sitch? You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird. You were supposed to be here at three. Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National. I don't see why we have to invite everyone. Cafe Blase. Let's meet tonight, okay? What did Jeffrey's dad say? Nice ensemble! Totally stale. And the ushers are like, the acne patrol. We're thinking Pavilion. Sitch? Beverly Center. Well, where? What are we doing? Please. It's so '91. Guys, what's the sitch? I'm bored. Buffy? Okay. Throw it out. Well, I hope so. I can't believe they still ate it. They'll kill us! Pike isn't a name. It's a fish. Wit-tay. As long as there's room for three in it. What, didn't you bring your new friends? Okay! Look, Buffy. You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine. But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing. I really do. Right. You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it. This isn't just any dance. It happens ot be the last dance of our last year. You're so out of it. You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee -- Oh, thank you very much. Weird? You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke? I saw you last night after the game. Oh, please! When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink? Buffy, the ape-woman. Smell of booze much. Can't they make exceptions? Maryanne Heinel? She's such a scud. Can't we have a Maryanne clause? Oh, yeah! Okay. Oh, please. Like we don't have rights too? He is so bald.I haven't seen him tonight. Hi. Later for it. Well, I guess you got what you came for. You're having a fling with him? Buffy, Jesus! You know these steps. You and Cassandra get anything done last night? Hey, Buffers. You look thrashed. Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys. I guess. Cassandra's really smart. I don't get it. Thank you very much. No. It was mondo bizarro. -- like she's gonna kill me. Come one, that was so weird. Cool. We can figure decorations and stuff. Good enough! So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house? They don't even have Dolby. You got a C-plus? I can't believe I cheated off you. Cool! Buffy! I gotta bail. You coming? Well, that's the thing. She landed on her feet. Didn't even sprain a toe. And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this -- Snapped. Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room. Perm over heels. Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke. Nee sitch. No way. It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch. And the January Semi-formal -- Except for Prom. So, we're stupid now? Like you've got a grip. What are you talking about? I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?' And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!' Way mental. I really was way way too too. Seriously, Buffy. That look was way twisted. What were you thinking about? Nice much. Well, look who's here. If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that. Right! Environment. That's cool with me. The homelesses? God! Take a chill lozenge. Oh, God.Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James... A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy? Don't go looking for it, Dil. That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say. Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil? Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy? What was it? Lucky you. Get that thing off me, Fergus -- I sincerely hope so. You a handyman, Fergie? Some judge... Yes? Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear. Fergus, I think you don't trust me. We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do. Perfect. You were made for this. You know what. Go. Aye. Then we'll leave her be. Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal. Och, you do, Fergie. So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us. Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care. You're never out, Fergus. We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them. You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be. But you know what the thing is, Fergus? So you did fuck up. We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen? Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair? Eddie and Tinker died. No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened. What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up? Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up. Put that thing back on him, Fergus. My pleasure. Someone's got to do it. Fucking do. I had him all over me. He's all right. Can't. There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country. Horny bastard. Do you want some food? I said shut the fuck up -- You're heading for trouble, Fergus -- You shut your face -- It was fun while it lasted. See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance. Come and get me, soldier -- People. They could be looking. You never know. Not here. Tell me, Jody You didn't? You'd know I wouldn't run off. You don't know me, do you? The teddy bear? You're crazy -- No, we are. Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love. You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.You mean John Bubber? I read the probation report. It's not good. I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but.. So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante. Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced. My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance. I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance... I took a loan on my car and my computer. Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse. The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail... "The Angel of Flight 104!" You're telling me you're the A...? Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you... I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job. You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once. It's November. How recently? I understand. How often do you see your son? Are you pretty involved in his upbringing? And a son by your ex-wife? Joseph. We can hope. You still have your job, right? I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report... He means prison, Mr. LaPlante. I got your bail continued.Back to the jungle, Bernie. Good night. Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you. Where's your other shoe? Never mind! I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy. How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling. He's ten years old, Bernie! Impressionable! Maybe not,... but you let him believe it! And then I gotta explain about the homeless... I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less... He's in bed! You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand? He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed... The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine! He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down! Like you let everybody down, always! What did you do, take a mudbath? He had an emergency call... a real emergency. It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever! You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth-- I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie. He waited for you three hours! Oh my God! Bernie! It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?" But I don't -- I don't hate -- him. I... loved him once, Joey. Very much. I just got... tired. Maybe it wasn't all his fault. He... What's happening? Oh, my God... If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to. I... I hate the way he behaves ... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical... My God! It... it is him! You were in bed. Weren't you? Who lost a shoe? Wash your hands.Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record. Was it you? Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse? Why? Was it you? In the plane? Who saved my life? Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you? I snuck in. Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts. You may have already killed him! Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled. Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail. You won't get a cent. I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante... All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part. What's more he's going to apologize. In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness. He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car. It was just an impulse, stealing my purse. You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free. I'm a veteran reporter. I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime. A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet... blackmailing a national hero... He had one tiny , uncharacteristic moment of weakness. That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime... Yes, everybody is in love with John Bubber. The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence... If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Here! Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks. How much have you got, Chucky? Give Mister LaPlante your money. If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up. For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way. Let's go, Chucky. A police escort is gonna pick us up en route. You too, LaPlante. What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do? What are you -- ? How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante? Camera, Chucky. Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir? What is your relationship with John Bubber? No, John, you're too hard on yourself. I've got the creep here, the guy who's... John, I know all about it. It's no big deal, it just looks better carrying me. Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time. I just remembered. You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing. There, like that. Kind of, uh, sexy. You can support me anytime, John. You're doing fine. You didn't actually lift me though. It was more like you supported me. Now you help me up. Boy, you seem... taller. It must be psychological... now that I know you saved my life... Read it. It'll be fine. You were... very... inspiring. Goodnight, John. I know the truth, John. I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow. Interviewing them live on network hookup! No, I don't have the right. You're a news story ! You did save my life! And it's me ! I'd be taking advantage of you ! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional... I... I... I know that, John... Years? There are going to be lots of... opportunities. Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield... John, I'm sure she could support just about anything. I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard. Make sure no harm comes to you. You're a celebrity, John. People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both. ...unworthy of the adoration. We all do. Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody. You've known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement. So you feel like a fraud... All the adulation? It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it? You were saying you don't want a million dollars. Because he was a real hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing. He didn't expect the media to lionize him. He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante.... For how much, LaPlante? A couple of bucks? Did you give him enough for a decent meal? And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John. "For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth." The...Silver...Mike...Award! This sofa is a lethal weapon. The springs... are... the springs... what...? You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW! Maybe, maybe not. I have a feeling this guy is important somehow. What're we talking about? Reach out for what? Did you get it? Jesus, did I say that? He'll do it. You really-should have talked to him first. There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...? A "mystery guy!" "Not a passenger." Who? You said all the passengers were accounted for... Would the station put me up at a good hotel...? The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean. You just can't bear the idea of good news. It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman. Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?" I haven't won it yet. I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony. I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him. I didn't say I thought we should have saved him.. Hello, Mister Wallace. Hi, Chief. You like the suicide? I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston... Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know -- We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but... We're from Channel Four, yes. We'd like to find -- Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones. Don't be ridiculous. I'm a reporter. He's pretty... remarkable. Look at the guy! He just saved fifty people. Now he's going to disappear. Who is he? Nobody stole my credit cards. They burned up in the crash. Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations? Who? Call him back. Ask him. I'm a little...busy. What about?No. Not on station time. My story. My time. I know what I saw. Yeah? Well, you just struck out. It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way. Not tight skirts. Tight stories. Jesus Christ ... What do you mean? Doc? ... Doc ... Hello? Hello? That is the story of my life. You'd lose the money-shots. No. I'll catch a bus. Or a cab. Don't worry about it. Go. Better hurry, Doc. A real story. With a real reporter. I know. I know. But it's just so ... neat, isn't it? The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me. Wha .... ? So where is it? Then tell me what to do. I don't know ... What can we do? What will he do? What does he want? Kirsty Cotton. Yes. But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back? And why are you back? Why are we here? And what did you discover? And what is ... this frozen moment? Captain Spenser. Elliott. I ... What the Hell is going on? It's ... I don't know. First World War, right? Wait ... wait. You ... you have to help me. I don't understand. Am I dreaming this? Help me pick 'em up, Terri. I think the lady just made a sale. God knows. Anything. Contacts. Clues. Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ... Oh, Terri ... Terri? What on earth were you doing down here? Jesus. Are you sure this is the street? It's Saturday morning. Let's go shopping. Would you know this store again? That you found. What do you mean you found it? Woah. Wait a minute. Who? The kid? Maybe not. But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue? No. He knows it won't. It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet. Every day. I don't know his name ... I saw the whole story. A wounded bird was on his roof. I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it. I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't. Its pain spoke directly to him. He picked it up. Nursed it. Fed it. And it got better. Everyday he'd watch the pigeon. Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away. Didn't look back. But he heard the sound of its wings. ... but it is good. You know, over to the left, you can ... I don't think so. But it's a fascinating subject. Did you ... No. I buy them to impress people. Of course I've read them. How have you ... ? The bank owns it. But I'm working on it. No! No, that's OK. I like to. I love boiling water. It's a specialty of mine. Why don't you go watch cartoons? I'll boil some water. Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri. Can I ask? Is it always this ... exploratory? Wait. Wait. The chains. Where did the chains come from? Wait a minute. He was already ... wounded ... when you found him? Taken what? Did you know him? Yes I do. Terri, something awful happened to that boy. I have to find out what it was. Sorry. It was my father's. It's temperamental. I'm trying to quit. I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream? No, you know, you do. You must. What you mean is you don't remember them. What? God, no! Nothing like that. No, he died before I was born. He died in Vietnam. I never knew him. Never met him. We don't even know the details. I dream of battlefields. Of searching. Of trying to find out. No. No, it's OK. I ... It's my father. Why are you so interested? ... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything. It's ... well, I know what it is. Oh yeah ... What? I put some decaf on. Er ... make yourself comfortable. No. No. It's fine. Come now. I was having bad dreams anyway. Yeah. Sure. You mean ... tonight? I want to talk to you. We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night. Right. Right! Joey. Yeah, who is this? Uh-huh? Under the Underground? What's that? Where is ... Where? Hold on. Hold on, please. I need talk to you. What happened to him? I don't know. Maybe. Can we see? What else came with it? Anything still here? Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it? No. We want ... No. No, you don't understand. We're not selling it. It came from here. We want ...Right at the back there. Middle shelves. Coupla folders. Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price. You gonna buy? Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff nobody'd ever want. It was part of a job-lot. Some loony- bin they shut down. Unclaimed stuff. Never mind. I'm glad it's gone. Made the store feel strange. Who'd make such a thing? I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business. I ... Everything sold as is. No guarantees. No returns. No. Sorry. Not interested. Not for my customers. Have you tried ...You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard! You get me in here ... You shit. Who do you think you are? But you gave me a rose ... Oh. Like I'm not an interesting person. Do you mind me talking about your stuff? Wow. Thank you. No. Really? Oh come on. There're lots of girls here who look better than ... I'm sorry. The barman? I thought he was called Rick? A prize? For what? Thank you for the drink. And the rose. Wow. That's ... really nice. And this is your club. Great club. I really love it here. Great club. You're JP Monroe, right?Joey ... ? What am I looking for? Here! Here! Pull over! For somebody else, alright? Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore. Buying some drugs, alright? Yeah. Happening, isn't it? Sure. Why? I was downtown looking for a ... a friend. A guy I know. Anyway, there was this store. Like real old? Lotsa weird shit in there. I saw this statue. Pillar. Thing. I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club. No. JP. My last boyfriend? He like owns the club. You know? You were there? He bought the statue. Yeah. I found it. I knew held like it and I figured ... But I don't know what's going on. Maybe he thinks it'll come back. And he still sits there? Who's that? Cool. I read a book once. It was like all these people discovering who they used to be. You know, like reincarnation? It was really good. You ever read that? Wow. Lotta books. You read all these? Guys. Sometimes friends. Mostly guys. Jeez, I've never owned anything. I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old. This is great. And it's yours? You like own it? I'll do it! Ha! I don't know yet. First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me. I figured I'd make breakfast. That's what I'm trying to tell you! ... Yeah! That's what I'm saying! And it was lying next to him. And he pointed at it before he passed out and ... The thing! He was lying there in the street, moaning. But he pointed at it ... 22 No. I'd seen him in there a few times before. He was just a punk. I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief. He must've taken it from the statue. But I don't know anything! Really. I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street. He ... Oh. You wanna talk about that stuff. It's okay. It's just someone burned me once. Oh, go on. Have one. Fuck it. You think you're going to live forever? Great. Thanks. You gonna have one? No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything. It's just I don't dream. Never have. ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams. I'm jealous. It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean? That's great. Oh, right. Did he used to ... ? Sorry. What is it? Your dream. You said you were having a bad dream. Right. Of course tonight. Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ... Oh yeah. Yeah. Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right? I'll trade you. You give me couch-space. I'll give you talk. OK? Right ... So ... Well, what do you want? You like ... left me a card? At the club? Uh ... Hi! Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill? Under The Underground. Can I like GO now?! Look, lady! I told you! It's not my problem! I was just there! It's nothing to do with me. I wasn't even with him. It was off the statue. In the club. Really? No. It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know? Freaked her out. Just fucked up something good again. I don't think so. Not yet. I'm not ready yet. Yeah right. Look ... A girl? Anyone I should know? Yeah ... yeah, it looks different. Not quite. This wasn't here. Oh, I don't ... Yes. 53 I miss you too. Well ... of course I have. I've thought. I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible. You really hurt me ... You're apologizing? Yeah really. I'm ... Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here. Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station. I'm meeting lotsa new people. It's really great. Yeah right. How'd you get this number? What do you want? JP? Joey?We only got one .. He doesn't drive. Only me and Mom .. No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat. The van? As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into me ? What's the problem?I don't want them to arrest you. I wanna be near you ... I'm blind because my father drank. I know about alcohol, John. Then why didn't he kill me? I can't identify him .. Why does he want to kill me? Then explain it to me . I got enough darkness, don't I? Don't say that. Don't you dare say that .. I believe you .. I'm going back to the institute. Why? Why can't I stay with you? Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back .. No I'm not. I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions .. Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud .. I know. Fifty-seven .. I don't mind .. Just your age. He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick. Ross told me. I know what you're like .. Have you known her long? Sorry? You said, you were in the bad lands? Do you pray? No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry? "Thoughts that lie too deep for tears." You just asked me to ask you questions. Are you married? I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me .. Oh. Are you wearing a uniform? You should. It's wonderful. Hamlet. Have you read it? It was probably the wind. If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back? Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" .. I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had? I'm sorry. I'll get my things. Have you been here long? I don't know. Yes. Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something? No. Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's. No. Except he smoked. Like you. My hands? No, it has a mind of its own. I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some? Why not? You heard my voice? When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde? Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things .. What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross? Is that Margie? Don't mix very well with beer. You think John would like it? I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these? You think he still loves her? What does that mean? What was she like? When did John divorce?I'm here, honey. I'm right here. How you doing on those shoes? I think John, would love it ... Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still .. Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession. You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank .. Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet. Two or three years ago. He's not that bad of a guy ..? You want something, darling? Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne? He's happy, darlin .. Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid .. No it isn't .. It's Californian .. So tonight she confesses? Freddy's new obsession .. Bobby's out .. What's the hurry? I'm not giving him Pizza . I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.I hope he doesn't have rabies. You sure did... What happened to you? Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things... It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young. He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years. I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews... Is something wrong?I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again. You know everything, don't you? I miss him too... How did it go with your father last night? How long have you been here? Geoff? Anybody see my boy?Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead. You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town. The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church". Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat? Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?What about crack? You a user? Yeah. We all got caught. Shoplifting. Cuttin' school. Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade. So we gotta come here. So we'll be good, in the future. So we'll learn valuable lessons. And I learned mine. I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again. Can I go now? Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it. You know she thinks it's a sin.Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there? What you do? No, but... I don't know... sometimes. Well, what about the sex stuff? What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow. Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it. Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay. 'Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation. How come? Sister? We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.JUST SING! You re okay -- for a civilian. Van Cartier. We could cut a demo. Look for a label. Is there any syrup? She's a pro. Again! Amateurs 2 Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn! Tell me about it. Wet behind the ears. Of course. I'm a nun. Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer. I knew that. Very nice. Sisters, have we learned our lesson? I won't hold this little episode against anyone. I'll try not to. You're a ringer. She brought you in to replace me. Out with the old. Free-lance? Oh really? You think I don't see? You think I took vows yesterday? I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother. Mary Clarence, are you with us? Soprano or alto? Shirelles. I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods. It wasn't all modern, like here. No electricity. Cold water. Bare feet. Those were nuns. It was Hell on earth, but I loved it. This place is a Hilton. Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place. Enough jabber. We can't leave it up to the Feds! That should have tipped us. We're losing it. Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30. Sharp. Is it worth it? A lot of witnesses here.SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE! BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE Hurry, Sister! This is so exhilarating! All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing. What is it, Mary? We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work. SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE All right, I am, I know it! All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic. Perky. I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine. She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess." Am I? The Dixie Cups? Oh my. I was just a girl. Of course. SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I know. It's ancient. Two days. An hour or so. Chops? Mary Clarence, could you? Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but... Could you help us? Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell. Shuttle, beat, shed. And watch your heddles. You betcha. Isn't it lovely? Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed. Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed. Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear? Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely self-supporting. Like all convents. Like yours. To sell, of course. I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's. We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money. Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent. The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver. Have you ever used a loom? 1961? '62? Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows. It's the last secular music we recall. I haven't heard that song in ages. The Ronettes? Isn't it a glorious morning? Good morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well? We've got to save her! Look what she did with the choir. She made us sing beautifully. We sound terrible We need Mary Clarence. It should be here any minute. Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy? Measles. Peace on Earth. She told us about one. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas. But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun? Bless her! There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve. That's why many of us became nuns. It's marvelous, Reverend Mother. Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother - Yes? Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's. Impossible. Christy. Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun? But how do we get there? It's so beautiful... She's our inspiration! She wasn't a nun? You mean -- they kidnapped her? We'll pray -- and she'll be there. Mary Clarence! Sister! Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us. Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this? But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style. It's better than ice cream. He's kind. He's not like other guys. We did it! We actually sang a chord! Really, Mary Clarence? Were you a choirmistress? Which convent was that, Sister?Really. Oh-huh. Hail, Mary.HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY! BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING I WAS DOWNHEARTED Mary Clarence! But what do they want? Where are we going? Again? Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you? The Council of Cardinals! I'm so nervous! What if I forget the words? Are you leaving us? A thank-you? For what? You're the one we should be thanking. We're nuns! HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU I don't want to mess anyone up... What? Now stop that. You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience. I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood. We could have been killed! But you saved me! Thank you, Mary Clarence! What was all that? Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us? Oh my Lord! Mary Clarence! Mary Clarence! I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences. I've learned so much. Mary Clarence! You're so... different from the other sisters. Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson. Those people are wonderful! Why don't we ever see them in church? I'm getting experience. Who are all these people? Really? I have to do this. So I can become a nun. Experience! Right? We need experience. Mary Clarence! Are you sure? Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it? What? She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner. Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy. I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me! No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out! I want to get in? You have to help me A novice. Three years. Sister. Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert. An extra heel of bread. Please take it, you need your strength. You've been working so hard. I... I brought you something. I... I... It's after five. We have to bathe. Come on, we're late. Not a note. Mary Clarence -- you're alive! A Benedictine. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight! And what a lovely name. Las Vegas... Well, I don't care who she is. We can't sing without her! An... entertainer? Yes -- two men -- and they had guns. We can't sing without her! What should we do? It's no use. She just isn't here. Mary Clarence, don't be silly. You're an example to us all. You've taught us so much. We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows? Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes. Ice cream! It's brought people back to the church. It's better than springtime. I'd rather sing than do anything! He's decent. That was exciting! Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said. Is this like your old convent? Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet? For final vows? Reverend Mother? Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere. She said they were from her old convent. I don't understand. Where is she?Really? Perhaps. Well... thank you. Oh? Don't push it. Perhaps not. Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex. You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion. Very well. I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For utterly disrupting our way of life. And for placing all of us in mortal danger. Thank-you. I'm a Christian. Oh? Saving you. Move! Good day. I am sorry, Mary Clarence. I seem to have misplaced my tambourine. Good day, Mary Clarence. You and I know that life is not so simple. There will be disappointments. Rude shocks. And you will have vanished. How... fortunate. A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party. Indeed. After how long? A few weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know nothing. I must go where I can be of use. I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible. Really. Well, that makes two of us. You have a phone call. The majority has spoken. Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program? I believe this can be settled by a simple vote. The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church. They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place. And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best. And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir. Out of the question. Through blasphemy? You have corrupted the entire choir! And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino. The choir, Mary Clarence. Go for the gold. You're my Olympic event. You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart. As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage. You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir. You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task. Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct. Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself. Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity. To change. To make a decent life for yourself. Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable! I don't believe we have anything to say to each other. Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined! Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on. How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence. "No pain, no gain." Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27? He spoke unto a wastrel youth. He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment." You are correct. Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. Such as your own, for example. How do you feel about physical labor? We are nuns. We seek solutions through prayer. This is a convent, not a clinic. We offer moral guidance, not hardware. A balloon and a banana! Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking? Mary Clarence! Come, Sister. Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return. Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage. Do not attempt discussion. Am I understood? From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. I'm sure. If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life. And its direction. Or lack thereof. It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams. Your cell is more than adequate. And whom would you call? Useless distractions. Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions. Your cell. Your room. This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence. Yes. Until breakfast. No food. Not until sundown. A fast. To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat. As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast. Until sundown. Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard. Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence. And the vow of chastity. The vow of obedience. The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola. There are three vows that every nun must accept. The vow of poverty... As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence. Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all. While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are. You will not disrupt the convent. You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way. Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire. Would you like that? Before we do, you might like to freshen up. And you'll certainly want to change Of course. But it's almost lunch. Check your driver's license. Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines. And all those like you. I joined this convent some thirty years ago. At that time, the world knew some measure of peace. And hope. Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise. And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed. Drugs. Gangs. Spandex. And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls. It has come to pass. Your cigarette -- out. Miss Van Cartier. Sit down. I see. The reason? You were unhappy? St. Anne's? Very well. Enough joking. Your name? What is your full name? Your Christian name? However, we can also pray for other things. All right. It's a beginning. Las Vegas, Nevada. She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger. Really... Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing? I need to see you, at once. Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence? Sister Mary Patrick? Yes, Mary Patrick? Yes? But where? But... she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent. Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were? Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together. But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood. I lied. But, Bishop... We're a small convent, Bishop. Surely there are... more appropriate shelters. But she's been exposed to the underside of life. She is the underside of life. Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but no.And you'll face that danger head-on. As if I could stop you. And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing. I know. St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality. To all in need. Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother. The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation. And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation. We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya? Can I get you something for the road? Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave. You a mini-golfer?You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you? He's dead, isn't he. Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born. Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright? Hello?My poor baby! Son? We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house. You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley. I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps. He's the guy Buzz. Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin! The Peter Pan. Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die. He's no father to you. Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself. This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first. He's not here. Get that outta your mouth! I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be? Who wants to know? Zeus!She hit it, Mr. Kastle! 132, 154. Hello, Mr.Kastle.Oh, a professional man. What'll you have? You look like you're something on the lanes. Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan. You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze. Junior who? Who's there? Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in? Don't go near the bowling alley. You still got the touch Junior. Leave him alone! You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes! That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything! After we eat, Dad. Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it. Can you change something this big? Lips still for sale? Very professional. Suck my dick! I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you. Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone. What about plan C? I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word? Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again. Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out. I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it. Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila. Theo, Buzz is dead. Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes. You don't get two chances with Junior. If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both. Why did you come back? Can I come with you? Where are you going? Are you sure he's dead? I feel sick. If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back. Tell me what happened Theo. Did you - kill him? We would have sooner or later. I told him you were my boyfriend. It? You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron, or anywhere else. These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm. I can't - I can't do it. He's my brother. I'm afraid you'll hurt him. I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders. I can't tell you, Theo. No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it. You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming? Nothing. And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow. Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you? I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right? It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it? ...lane six. Yes. You're here. You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill. Come on, bargain with me. How much would you charge me for the lips? Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man. I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan. My mom told me not to stay in this town. Do you talk with your mom? I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo. Plan C... ...is me. Come on Theo, what about plan C? What? Be my body guard? Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt. Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him. Ha! And what do you have to do for him? What do you think my dad's gonna do for you? What's plan B? So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated? Why were you suspended? I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you. Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl? We'll get into that later. So, what about you? Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants. No. Not at the present. Do you have a boyfriend? Do you have a girlfriend? Can I ask you something personal? You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo. Mind if I cut in? It's a vicious cycle. He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while... The mental hospital. Everything has it's drawbacks. When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person. Better than any sex I've ever had. I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do. Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand. Won't your father help you with that? What do you want with my dad? Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing. Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits. Mine, and they never tip. Coming right up. How do you want it? The eggs. Whips...orange whips.Yippy! Strokin'. Here goes nothin'. Like this? Yeah. Grasp firmly. Then what? I just hold it loosely with both hands?You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole. On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend. Like whores? For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...? You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em? But what they done, they... A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done? All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better. She's gonna live. She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke. Rain's coming. We was... lyin'. We ain't got it. We ain't got no money. I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow. What wife? He don't have no wife. What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?He said... That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife... I didn't think they'd really do it. She back in Kansas? I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't. Your wife? I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want. You want... a free one. Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones. Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment. Are you really going to kill them? I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's. Three days. Are you hungry? On the Bar T... looking for... them. They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke. You don't look nothin' like me, mister. You ain't dead.N-no, sir? He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73. Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was... A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T... L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then... About where you an' him was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'... In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..." They got... a sign on him says he was a killer. N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died. Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow. Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill... They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because... He's... he's dead. Ned's share? Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I... Maybe you should... hang the carpenter. Uh... Sheriff... Uh... Did you... kill him? R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...? Is... is it... loaded? But... if he doesn't miss? But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first... You... you mean... English Bob killed him while...? And? But he was called... You were there? I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which... Duke. Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and... Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place. Uh... Duke. D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death. It's only a b-b-b-book... N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite... Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...? Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first. Wh-wh-who did you kill first? B-b-books. You... you killed five men... singlehanded. I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer. P-p-p-please, I'm not armed. M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill. I... I... think I'm... shot.
