She was nothing but bother.  I not like her, Mr. Jimmy not like her. We do better if you live-in again, Mr. David. Yes, I call you at this number. Mr. Jimmy?  More coffee? Stop lagging behind, Jimmy.  We'll be late for church. Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap. Jimmy.  The privy needs cleaning. Don't get above yarself, Jimmy. Leave the drawring to the artists. "Quite so." Jimmy Whale.  Who are ya to put on airs? Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting. Mr. Kay, sir. Time for you to leave. Water.  Glasses at the sink. Which ones?  I bring them all. I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys. Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold. Daisy. My name is Daisy. You know.  I could help you fix up this place real nice. I gave it up for Lent. How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today? You remember what the doctor tells us. I am not forgetting your last brief chat. He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey. The Master is waiting for you. He's down in his studio.  Here. Take this with you. I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine. What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man? You will not hurt him? No.  No. I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray. A spooky movie.  Just what this place needs tonight. Sure.  Your friend want one? I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn. Sounds screwy to me.  I can't imagine a real artist wanting to spend time looking at that kisser. I bet this is just some fruit pretending to be famous.  So he can get in the big guy's pants. Just thinking out loud. All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are. Not anymore you don't.  Doll. This looks corny. Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him? These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny. Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them. He is not going to kill the old man? All right!  You don't want She is horrible. Ugh.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy, but your movie is not my teacup. Still, I am glad there is a happy ending.  The bad people are dead and the good people live. Weird movie.  Weird, weird, weird. Weird. What's to be jealous of? Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him. It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water. Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette. Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me? It never crossed your mind? All the old men I know think about nothing but sex. You picked up that girl right in front of me. It still hurt.  A lot. No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you. Sure.  I loved it. You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again -- The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid. What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer? Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone. Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not? From here on out, Boone, you're just another tired old face on the other side of the bar. You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy? Good night. Oh no, Mr. Jimmy. You done yet, love?  I am absolutely dying for a fag. Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time? Boris?  Do I look a fright? Oh, James. And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup. Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman. In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper. More your line. Of course.  This afternoon. The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask. Expect nothing fancy. The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea. No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room. Long enough.  Fifteen years. No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone? Your wife? Why? A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman. Men.  Always pulling legs. Everything is comedy. "How very amusing.  How marvelously droll." Of course.  I am married still. He is dead now, twenty years. No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much. Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad. This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven. No.  His is the worse. The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame? What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other. Yes!  You know? That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge. You did not know? You and he are not doing things? Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries. Yes.  I trust you. You must go in.  Quickly.  He will not like to think I have had you in the kitchen. A visitor. Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend. No.  But someone you can talk to. I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ. It must be up in your old room.  I will look. Oh, Mr. Jimmy.  You make a mess of it.  Here. That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short. No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food. I had no idea you'd be here. How are you? Splendid.  Now that I know you're around. Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again. I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now. Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder? I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know. Quite.  I adore gardens. Jimmy.  How are you? I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather. We're all getting a bit long in the tooth. Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account. I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes. What's our pesky friend up to now? Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion. Boris, darling.  I didn't know you were here.  These public revels are hardly up your alley. And what do you make of our royal visitant? Of course she's a lady.  What did you expect?  A hussy in tennis shoes? Don't you just love being famous? Are you all right, Jimmy? We'll be in touch, Jimmy. Hello?  Oh, Mr. David! No, no, he did not tell me.  But no problem.  I will make breakfast. Ten?  Very good, then.  Good-bye. I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast. There is nothing you can say that will surprise me. I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke. What do I do? It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill. Enough talk.  I must wake up the master. Mr. Jimmy?  Morning, Mr. Jimmy. What have you done with him? Mr. Jimmy!  Mr. Jimmy! Look for him! Ohhh! Oh, Mr. Jimmy. He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life. You poor, foolish man.  You couldn't wait for God to take you in his time? You must leave.  You were not here this morning. The police will not know that. They will want to investigate. Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone. You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back. Poor Mr. Jimmy.  We do not mean disrespect.  You will keep better in water. The trash, Clay.  Before it rains.
