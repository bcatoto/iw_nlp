It's horrible, it's depressing, I love it. What else? I want to re-pitch that pregnancy idea. Find six women early in their pregnancies and follow them all right through to the births. I have an idea. This is something I've been thinking about for a long time. We're "Real TV" right? I mean that's the name of the station. So let's go real. We find someone. Just a regular person, someone. And we put their life on television - live... all day long. Calm down. No. We go way beyond that. We don't film it and edit it and put it on later. We go on the air live every morning and the show goes off each night, when our subject goes to bed. In between, we're on live all day, every day - the same person, -- for let's say a month. That's not a show that's a surveillance camera. The hell we can't. Look, the beauty of being a cable  channel is we can take chances. I've thought about this and I'm telling you, I think this can make a noise. A loud one. There are twelve thousand channels. You've got to do something that says "Look at me!" Hell, people look at fish tanks all day. This is people! Someone's real life -- an TV, all day long - live... And, you know what? I'm doing it. You asshole! My mother's going to see this! I don't - And that concludes today's show. This is where you go around and collect the money. Hi. You guys know my roommate, Rita. Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing. Yeah... Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me. You shouldn't drink. And, you know, every guy I ever broke up with, the minute it was over, I could tell you what went wrong, how it went wrong, why it had to go wrong... but when I'm in it... lost. I'm like a love coroner. Bring me the corpse, I'11 tell you what killed it. But how to prevent it? Lost. Oh for -- Put those -- Oh God... Um, yeah, I was gonna ... Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry. I batted! Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday. Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late." What did you study? He's who we want to go with. I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable. Look it's not like we're  burning up the airwaves now. We're running neck-and-neck with The Gardening Channel. If people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes, we're a hit. Plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the screen... and the beauty is this guy doesn't even have to be good. I mean if he's good, great. But if he winds up making an ass of himself, better. How is that better? Come on. People cannot turn away from an accident. You drive by, you say "Ooh, I hope there's not a head lying in the road" but you look ! See, nobody in America wants to be nobody. This guy wants to be famous. So, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down the highway. Fun for the whole family. So let's do it. Oh. I -- I heard Ray yelling. 1 didn't mean to -- What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV? They're gonna mock our foibles. Our foibles, our foibles! Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles. Eddie, please don't let them mock our foibles. Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours. How? What does that have to do with... ? Are you sure about this? Why do it? Cream rinse? So? Dynamite is dangerous. Ed, can I see you a second. Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you. I want you to take this. That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay? Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you? I bet my career on you. You'd better be good. I do. So far... Get him out of the house! I want him moving! Welcome to work, Ed. No reason. just... I just want to see what happens. Oh, come on, they wouldn't put it on if nothing was gonna happen. I think he's cute. No, I haven't seen the spot ratings... I think that's a number  from which we can hopefully, uh... build... I disagree... No, I am not ready to pull the plug... Yes, Mr. Scharlach, I know they shoot horses... Look, it's been one day. Can I have a week with this and then have you fly up my nose?! He did that at my parents' house. He is so wound up. He bought all new clothes for this. Who? He sang to her and they fell in love? Right. Just a few more minutes. Read your book. Choke to death, you boring bastard. Yes. Try not to stay in one place too long. Get outside as much as you can. How about a date? No, I mean... Let's not worry about that vet. You're testing well. There's another problem. It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out. Ed, the audience can smell the desperation coming through the screen. Never would be plenty. Ray, where do you keep the glasses? Who's Shari? Ray, I finished the Snapple. Is there more? Yes! Go! Um... Shari knew you were coming over because she saw ... She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now. I ... gave her a drink. I thought it ... but she's not much of a drinker, so it's made her a little... belligerent. What do you want?! I'm gonna go to bed. You okay? Good night. Hi, Mom. Don't defend that horse's ass to me. Ha! I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him. Well, for one thing, he's a bad lay. I mean bad. Kiss him! Kiss him! Really? I found the Snapple. Yes! Yes! I win! Scharlach, you schmuck! I am the golden goddess of television! Oh my God. Oh my God. I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television! Leave. Go. Go! What are we doing? Really? Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you. Oh God, this is so weird. Eddie? ... Are the TV people with you? Send him away. No. No. It's a mess. Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend. He made a mistake. No. Maybe he's watching. Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl. I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy. I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"... Mm. Oh my God! Oh my God!! I will. I'11 tell them. That was Scharlach. All of you, scrub your asses. He's coming over to kiss them. Um, I'd like to get a new phone number, please... Because I'm getting calls from every nut case in America... Right, unlisted... Sure. Aren't you excited? He said he loved you on television! He didn't say it. His stepfather said it. Well, the stepfather's cute... Seriously, how do you feel about Ed? I think he's great. He just makes me feel... oh, I'm really gonna get hurt, this time - Hello ... This is really hard. I went out with Ray a few years ago for... a couple of months. And we... were intimate. And. he's really not as bad as that girl said he was. I mean, I've definitely had worse. So you're Ed. Ed... we love you! We're not going to be able to come over there for anymore midnight meetings. People are starting to watch your building. The interest level in you is soaring. Yes, Ed. Good idea. Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes? How you doing, Ed? Uh-huh? Can I tell you something? I think you are fantastic. I think you have taken an idea and turned it into something explosive. Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari? A woman wants to be pursued. This is so exciting! A real celebrity delivering my figs. Sign here, please. That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey. By the X. Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out. What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this? Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude. By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X. What are you doing? Yeah, well... You should see the one we wear when it rains. The what? Oh yeah. We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month! That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month. Sure it came to you! Because I brought it to you! You want a gut feeling?! How about a groin feeling?! Yeah, I watch it... More than I'd like to admit sometimes. I just kind of leave it an, you know, so it's... there. What's wrong with her! Everytime you look at this chick, it's like she badly needs a Tampax. Ed, you can do better. I'm stunned. Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph. That's lucky. Ed. What are you doing? Cliff is here. He's performing. I wanted you to see him. Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had -- For God sakes, you said two words about some lousy pizza joint, the guy's a millionaire now. This could be my whole future we're talking about. Hi, I'm Ed's sister. I've heard so much about you. Why? Euuw... Um... I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away. I know, I ... I really like you too... ... yeah, then, but... Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other. That girl's an idiot. I can't take it anymore... I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month! Everybody hates me! Look at this. Page three of the Post. A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no." They hate me! Twenty-nine. There's a list. Ed? Hi. I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great. You must be John. Well, I don't want to bother you, I'm just -- I was here auditioning for a skit. You know, one of those things where Dave goes around town with models and whatever... Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh... I'd better get a cab. Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown. V11 bet he goes out with her. It's like those actors -- as soon as they get famous -- Pfft - there goes the wife. He'll never cheat on Shari! Did you do this? Did you find him and get him to-- No way... Oh, this just keeps getting better. I can't believe you're taking his side. I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts. He ran away after I threw him out. How much is a new coil? Yes. Both. He had girlfriends! I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television! All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay? He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose. She could've been a nurse. She had white shoes. What's the difference? He was no good. Do you remember how he used to scream at me? You used to cover your ears with dinner rolls. Also, no job was ever good enough for him. "Small potatoes, small potatoes." Al, you remember -- He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al. This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone. And what did he come back now for? Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia. Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie. I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City. So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita. I'm sorry. Where? I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone. Okay. Are you all right? Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show. ...yeah? Good morning. Welcome to another day of Ed TV. Last night, while most of us were asleep ... this happened. Get them away from me. No. It's your fault. No... Could you? The what? What? Everybody's someone. I don't want to be famous for getting caught with my shirt off. If I'm going to be famous -- This is going right up your ass. Look... maybe we just better put us on hold until this is over. Coming in two weeks to the Lifestyle Channel -- Joma. His Dad's a cop, his brother's a bouncer in a topless bar, his sister is a black-belt social worker -- and Joma's living with two gals. I love you! 1 want to marry you! I will see that he's properly threatened. Oh. Ed. No. She left. She won't. She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself. She wouldn't tell me. Yeah. Great line. Ed, do you want my advice? Leave her be. Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth. We have to stop meeting like this. Did you arrange this? Whose dog is that? That's your dog. You want to? Are you busy tomorrow night? Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay? Oh. No. It's going to be about a half-hour. Good? Oh, I hope she makes love to him! I thought you didn't like her. I don't, but I want him to be happy- Ed? Yeah. Why? Take him off the air. I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us. Good luck. I was his third grade teacher. I said "Take him for tests. There's something wrong with him." They didn't listen. Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go! Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off -- Ed -- Ed -- Yeah? Well I'm not starting now. Eddie... I'm at the hospital. He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart. St. Joseph's. Dr. Geller, Dr. Stack wants to see you. Could I get your autograph for my niece? Al! How did you -- I'm fine. I ... It was horrible. He called me up. Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him -- What? To you? In front of him? With the... Oh my god! On TV! One thing led to another. He was my husband once. Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex. Don't tell Al. He doesn't know. Women who remarry but have sex with their first husbands. on today's Oprah. That's not funny!! Sweetheart, I'm gonna go ahead and sign all the papers. Ed! How did you know I was here? Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore! I'm a tramp Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us! I'm a whore! Your bathrooms are filthy! You're both good boys. I don't think so. 1 bailed. I bailed on you. It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship. You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner. My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut. Um... Mr. Scharlach, um -- you're not watching TV? Um... Ed -- and Shari are -- No. Here. They're in the building. They're on their way up. What do we have to do? So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number. I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here. And that concludes Real TV's coverage of Ed TV. Stay tuned for new programming information.
