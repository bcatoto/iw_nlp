What do you think you're going?! You  ought to be ashamed behaving like  that! What do you mean? You're a pig, you know that? How can  you be like that? ...Obviously some of the members are  exploiting the oil price differentials  as a loophole... This body has been  very precise in its policy. I thought you weren't coming back  till tomorrow... What happened to your eye? Poppi... We'd love to have you over to dinner  Admiral but the cuisine would be  Cuban not Mexican. I think your  stomach would find it more  agreeable... not to mention your  taste buds. The pleasure is mine... Encantada Senor... Senor Shaw. Mucho gusto. What are you doing? Read 'em on the Navy's time... this  is my time... Not fast enough. The thing about Carlos is... he  doesn't lose himself with a woman...  not with a lover... maybe with a  whore I don't know... I wasn't his  whore. Lovers are different to him...  he might have a use for them... so  he has to seduce them properly. He  has to make sure they're so crazy  about him they'll do anything for  him. Shhh! You're not here. You don't exist until I'm ready to  let you exist, and then... you do  exactly what I say. It's not pleasure for him... it's...  it's... it's... this sick kind of  conquest... you know this seduction...  he's got to make you not just a lover  but a disciple... a worshipper... He  brainwashes you with his body...  so... so... you'll do anything...  you see because he's the perfect  lover... he does it all to... not to  please you... but to excite you...  to... to make it dangerous for you  and then, that's very sexy too, to a  woman... that danger... like he could  kill you in a second... but instead  he makes you come... So he's almost  killed you, you see? And you have  this orgasm right then and it's like  he's killed you and there isn't  anything left of you and he makes  you be born again the way he wants  you to be. So there isn't a thought  in your brain that he hasn't put  there. Not a feeling in your body  that he hasn't put there. Take off your clothes. Look Mister... I don't want to know your name... I  don't want to know anything about  you okay. This isn't fun for me. I'm  not here to play soft music and be  romantic. I'm here to help you kill  him... At least I hope that's what  you're going to do. They promised me  it was. Take off your clothes. You're smaller than him. That's what he would have done if I  would have said something like that.  Without a moment's hesitation. What's  wrong with you?! No eres ni hombre! Now come to me and kiss where you  hit. Kiss where the blood is and then  smear it on my lips so I taste it. Now go down on me... yes like that...  si... si... tease me... tease... but  don't let me come... control me...  it's got to be when he wants it...  yeah... Ask me if I like it... he always  asks... he wants to hear it. Demand it. Yeah... Make me beg. Please... Please... Tell me you want me to  come... You want to feel it all over you... Stop!... Stop it! He never loses control... He never  tells you how he feels. He's in  control. He's the one who makes you  feel what he wants you to feel. He  never feels anything... You stupid...  stupid... Roll over! On your back! I'm Carlos... You're me. You like it... You like it? Ooooo I want to make you come... I want to make you come... I want to  feel it all over me. Let me... let me do it... Put your  hands down. He does that... he's crazy... he  chokes you... just a little. Then he goes to the refrigerator and  eats... He's always hungry  afterwards... always... God I feel  like filth. Get your hands off me! I don't care who you are. I don't  want to know anything about you...  except that you're going to kill  him. My God... My God... It's him. I don't know what you're talking  about. I don't know any Carlos... please  I'm telling you the truth. I don't know what you're talking  about... I'm not from here. I just  came to visit a girlfriend. This is  her apartment. She'll be here  tomorrow... please. I swear to you... I'm telling the  truth... What... what are you going to do to  me. You bastard! I haven't see you for  two years and this is the way you... I came all the way to this god- forsaken country didn't I? I've been  holed up in this place you arranged  for me for the past twenty-four  hours... I couldn't eat I couldn't  sleep... nothing just sitting in  here waiting for you. Whoever stocked this place with food  didn't leave much of a selection...  I wanted to go out and get some nice  things for you. You weren't supposed  to be here for another three hours.  I could have made a nice dinner. My God... my God... Just getting some air in here...  Don't be so jumpy. Forget about what's in there... I  found caviar and, here's some pate. Couldn't eat a bite of it. What? What are you talking about? You're crazy... no one... I...  Illich... listen... I ran out of  cigarettes and... and I was at a  cafe and I bummed a cigarette... I  had a cigarette and coffee and came  back here... that's all. Yes... yes... you know I can't have  coffee without a cigarette. The French... the DST... They made  me... I didn't have any choice... [This afternoon... the girl and two  DST agents dead, one wounded.] [Why?] You've been with another woman...  haven't you. Haven't you? You're different... Okay. I don't need any letters. And I don't  need you to talk to me like that  either. Where are you going? What? The fellow at the service station  said it needed a tune up. I took it  in this morning... You didn't say  you were going to need it. What? Why? What difference does it make. Did you check the mail? I don't want you goin' back to those  subs. I'll tell you that. You can request another assignment.  It's changed you Annibal. It's hurting  us. Your attitude... that's what hurting  us. You're suspicious of everything that  goes on... you snap at Joey, you  snap at me. I don't like it. Annibal... please! Annibal please. Let's go sit down. Annibal... please... Please... No! I won't let you do it! You're  not going back to those subs! It's  changed you... You need help, Annibal.  You could get some kind of stress  disability or... No, not enough. Whatever is going on  out there with your job... It's true. All night... Is it over? No. I won't leave you. You're not in prison and I'm not  your mother and I won't leave you. I  will not let him do this to us. Not  him... not the CIA... not anyone. Get me a gun and teach me to shoot  and he'll have to deal with both of  us. This animal will not destroy my  family. Please... come home. Hello... Hi... listen, do you and Annibal  want to come over with the kids for  a barbeque this afternoon? Uh sure, I think... but could I call  you back later? We're just about to  go to church. Annibal and the kids  are already in the car. Okay, call me when you get back. Great. Talk to you later. Bye bye.
