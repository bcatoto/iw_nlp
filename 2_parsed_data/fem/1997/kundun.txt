Who am I? This many? How many? I miss my brother. I pooped. Me. First break of day. Cow. Far, far away.Answer. I accept it. What are the causes of suffering? I accept it. What is suffering?We do not know. Yes, yes. Your brothers are here. Two. I will be back in a few days. I miss him too. You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered. At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink. Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come." He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die. Your father had been very sick. Oh, no. Where will he go? Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen. Please, come in, so cold. Good day. You decide. I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming. Me? I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us. Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen. I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.I see that. Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart. Too young? The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad. I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector." You were a beautiful baby. So calm. Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died. Again?
