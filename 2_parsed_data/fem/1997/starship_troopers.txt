They probably wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed. C'mon, let's see if they've posted the math final test yet. First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores.  Wish me luck ! Your turn... Hold on... I wanna talk to Marco. His sister's at Fleet ! She's flying starships ! Marco's sister. Can you imagine  maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology. For our final today, please identify the mouthparts, the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the nerve cord and count the ganglia. You may begin. Eeuch ! Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't  true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of  society. Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have identified over two billion species so far. Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly. But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel. True, we know of no insect society that has produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your head, take the example of the Arachnids, a  highly organized, highly evolved insect society. They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the  Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the  biological means to hurl their spore into space. Excuse me...! Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing. Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers. I don't want everyone to see. How come that's all you talk about anymore ? You can't walk me home. I thought you were going to help Carl. Johnny, my Dad's home today. It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran. Sometimes I do what I want, eh ? Get out ! Get out ! CARL...! Are you alright ? Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ? You're going to the Academy ? That's where I want to go. I'd love to talk to you abou that. Don't you have to finish the game ? Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face... You aren't thinking of applying...? Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened  to you I don't know what I would do... Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ? Good good, then it's all settled. Johnny, please. Calm yourself. Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach ! How do I know if this is love ? Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation... I'll meet you outside. Johnny, this is Zander. Good luck at the academy. He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ? No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance. Zander is going for pilot, too. Johnny Rico, you're jealous ! He's nothing like you. Are you the boy for me ? Oh, Johnny... Everyone's looking... we shouldn't... You're right. Let's never stop... Shhh... Sorry, Dad. See you, Johnny. Dad, leave him alone... I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...? Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse. I'm gonna go for pilot. Hey, Carl, what's wrong ? Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl ! Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what. I can't wait to tell my Dad I'm in. He's gonna be so happy ! Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ? I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look  handsome in a uniform. My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me  again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go. Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad. You talk to Carl ? It's exciting, but it's scary, too isn't it. Going someplace new where you don't I'll miss you, too, Johnny. Oh, that's me. Alright, I love you. I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write ! Sorry...! Sir, sorry...sir. YEOW ! I'll bet he makes squad leader. Improper Attitude ! They'll kick you out for talking like that... Off you go down Washout Lane, bye-bye ! We all have one thing in common. We were  all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile Infanterie. What's your excuse, Breckinridge ? So the grow 'em big and dumb on the farm planet, eh ?Djana'd ? C'mon, keep it going... Katrina ! I wanna be a mom. It's easier to get a licence if you've served. Your turn, Rico ! Me, I got plans to be writer, and a writer's got a right to be nosey. Flores, you know  Rico from Buenos Aires... What's his story ? Hey, what's going on ? Hi, Carmen ! Looking it down ! On my mark, in three, two, one... ...GO ! This is nothing. Today, I get to fly that ! Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am. Yes, ma'am ! Hey ! What are you doing here ? Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ? It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate. Yes, ma'am. In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up. Oh, yes, sir. Vector ? Or...? Oh, I see... teamwork. You are now prisoners of the Blue Team. Tell us your plans or die ! I'm going in ! Let's go ! Look at him. Do you think anyone has ever been so pleased with himself ? Hi, Johnny, I would've written sooner, but they've really got us going every  moment here. I'm glad you're doing so well. If they  haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will. Look at that. Isn't it beautiful ? I had  to show you. It's great to be out here on my own. I'm just not some little girl from Buenos Aires anymore. I'm gonna be a starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the universe... And that's also the problem because I don't really want to get married, Johnny. I don't want to have kids. I want a command, a ship of my own, and you know, I don't think that's  gonna leave a lot of room for you and me. I know that's not what you wanted to hear... but I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry. I'm afraid you'll hate me, and I couldn't stand that. Write me, alright ? Write me, so I'll know that we'll always be friends. Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever. No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way. Hey, check it. Don't change the subject. Am I right ? Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ? You and me, huh ? No, what do you want ? I want to be part of the best flight team  in the Fleet... WHERE IS IT ? It looks like an... asteroid. Communications are down, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am. Hello... Oh, Johnny...! Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You  little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you... Well, of course you should come home immedietly ! We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite. Oh, my, what's that ? This time of the year...? It's war ! Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny. I just hope it's not over before we get in it ! That guy's been in it. The eyes. He's got the 1000 meters stare. Get any what on you ? HeyJohnny !Johnny Rico ! Oh... at ease. Guess I oughta lose the hat when I'm off duty, eh ? What do you think ? Everyone did it when  we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ? It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying. You don't look very happy to see me. Johnny... Life is so different from the  way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us. Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now. Johnny, wait... Zander, please... Let's go ! What's wrong with you ? Well, here's to it ! We're gonna fightn, and we're gonna win ! Plasma, ma'am... from the planet. Here they come...! Let's get out of here ! AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! I can see the beacon...! Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young requesting approach vector... You know, we're lucky to be alive. You weren't thinking...you were dreaming ! There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too... So who's got time to get married ? Funny... No, funny there's almost no wounded at all. Oh no. Excuse me...! Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different... No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool. No, don't you see ? No one can wait for anything anymore... You're right... We should get married... Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ? Good luck. It's not there anymore. Mine, too. You never seen how they do it before ? It's gonna pop ! You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ? Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him  smile. Fire in the hole ! General ! GENERAL, stay with the wounded... Sir, the general...! Johnny...! I thought you were dead ! Rodger Young, this is inbound shuttle De Ruyter with an official request from the Mobile Infantery to bombard Planet P-11... Negative on your request. Fleet  Command has the battle group  on standby... Carmen sees Dizzy lying dead on the deck. ...I'm sorry. No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here. I thought you were KIA, Johnny... You look so... I don't know, you  look like you've really been in it. Almost got knocked out of the sky  over Big K. A funeral. Yeah. I don't know, Zander. Well, look at this. The three of us back together again. You knew and you sent them anyway ? Hope you get your Brain Bug, Carl. Take care, wilya Johnny ? Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ? Prepare for warp ! This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...! No way, ma'am ! Mayday, mayday ! This is  Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez in  lifepod RY63... I'm going in... This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez. Is anyone receiving ? My present location is 42 degrees  South by 176 degrees East... situation is extremely hostile... AAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Here they come ! Fire in the hole ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Johnny...! Zander...! Oh, you're hurt. I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ? Is it true ? Which way ? Zander, what are you doing ? Zander, no...! Look... they got it. To the best of my understanding, i
