Oh, that's not a problem. Not a problem. Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit. Can I help you?Won't forget? So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow? Yes, Max, I understand. I understand. I understand. Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go. I know. That's why I went. I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform. Thanks. I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it? This looks pretty good on me. Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on. But you're not going to stop her? He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her? Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman. Fine. Can you do it or not? 'Course I do -- I deliver money for him. Help you get Ordell Robbie. Take your time. I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit. That's my diet shit. Beauty products. My pocketbook. Help yourself. I'm not a loser. Arrest me. I'm not saying another word. If I were to tell you "no it isn't..." Suspicion of what? Would I mind? Do I have a choice? I doubt it. Who's your friend? The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air. Are you scared of me? I thought you were tired of your business? Sure I can't twist your arm? Wanna go? Start off in Madrid. Ever been there? Spain. I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money. Do you blame yourself for helping me? We're partners. I never lied to you. I didn't use you, Max. They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car? I told him I might. He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does. I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement. You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want. Only this isn't a bail bond, Max. Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note. I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail. Well, we don't let that happen, now do we? He's already there. Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared. I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that. Tell him I want to give him his money. Uh-huh. Get Ordell to come to your office. It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell. That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe? Ray wants him. He's liable to shoot you. How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't? How'd you find out? Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on. That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room. Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried. Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke. He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top. In the bag underneath. Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand. Don't be so literal. Ray believed it. All he needed was a reasonable explanation. Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them. I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in. That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you. It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money. What if I've figured a way? If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it? I'm not sure you answered my question. And is that it? Did you do it that night? You do that? What do you do when he comes home? Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house? The day you got me out of jail? When did you decide? Why? You're avoiding the question. You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed. No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else. What about you Max? He tries to act cool. He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire. Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words. You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it. He's setting me up to make a proposition. Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself. I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me. Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags. I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him. Right around here, in the food court. He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag. Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here. They seem to like the idea. I go back to work tomorrow. How old's Annette? Why? Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute. Who was your girl before Annette? And Annette's it for you? Does it happen to all men? Oh, are you? Does she know that? How was it? What'd ya see? I know, ignoring me. What're you up to? Surprise. Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell. I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote? Yeah. My ass ain't the same. It's different with men. How'd you feel about it? Really? I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you? How do you feel about getting old? I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again. If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em. Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work. He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar? He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can. We talked. He came by. He told me last night. It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in. I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money. I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens. I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available. '74, I think. The Delfonics. Uh-huh. I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records. I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair. Want to hear some music? Yeah. What, I couldn't hear you? Thanks, but I have my own now. I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail. I am. Have a seat. I think maybe I have more options than I thought. But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with. Yeah, if I cooperate. Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer. That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope. It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash? With ten thousand? Nine. I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that. I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in. It was the other guy who busted me. Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. I didn't? The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont. Ordell pick up his bond? That's him. How do you know 'em? Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me. I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke. Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that. Sure. Shit. So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right? You're not tired of it? She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are. Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat. That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand. You gain weight? 'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me. That doesn't sound dark. Is it dark? I'd love one, but not there. Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven? I don't think so. Can we stop for cigarettes? Who put up my bond? Ordell? Can I see your I.D.? Are you really a bail bondsman? Okay. If I don't cooperate? What if I plead guilty? Who's side are you on? You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them. Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you. You know what's in the bag you're taking? Then you don't see him for a few days? Not every day? Do you live together? Do you think I took some of that money? What about me? So what happens now? I thought you were watching him. If it'll make you happy. I have no idea. I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie? Not in the fitting room. I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling. I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do. She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform. Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it. And someone killed her for it. I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home. I thought I did. Si. How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second? That would be one point of view. Yes. All those things are true. Uh-huh. Ever been tempted? I never have. It's not my money. I was told ten thousand in each pack. We could, if I'm not in jail. You said that the last time. Right. Everything's the same, except one change... Uh-huh. She didn't say. Uh-huh. I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont. I'm sure that was the idea. It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell. White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's. Not yet. I imagine shit needs to be done. What for? Not really. This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out. Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis. A Broadway shopping bag. I thought you were going to let this one through. What are you doing? Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity. He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him? No. He sells guns. You never asked me if I did or not. If I'm working, I can help you. I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired. I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job. Can I smoke? Look, that shit ain't mine. You planted that shit on me. What the fuck is that shit? Yeah? Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store. I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us? Do you got something for me? Yeah, do you like it? Hi, Melanie. I don't think so, but thanks for the beer. Keep it between us girls? Dreaming. Kinda. Beaumont Livingston? He said he didn't know about it. That coke was yours, wasn't it? What were you two fighting about? How long you been with Ordell? Uh-uh. Killian's. Sure. Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway. I'm waiting for the phone. Oh, hi. He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money. Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it. And a hundred thousand if I go to jail. If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you. Ray, the A.T.F. guy. Where you gonna be during all this? The fitting room. There's a sign over the door. Designer clothes. Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like? What does she think she's gettin? Are you sure she don't know about the money? It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall. Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills. Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it. I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this. I was there, I saw her do it. Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout. I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all. I need to talk to you alone. Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up. Who? The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet? Plus the same deal as before. That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent. I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent. Well, it's my plan. We're in this together. I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court. Can you cover that? That's the idea. No, I give it to someone else first. The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before... If you want. I don't know. One of your friends. If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone. You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is. ...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill. They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in. It's true, isn't it? I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here. Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You. They already know it's you. I told them. I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you. I do okay. It's a cockatoo. It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick... The Cockatoo Inn. I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on. I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea. All your money's in Mexico. One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand. It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail. Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me. Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me? Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down. Go sit over in that chair. I said, you understand what I'm saying Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying? The cops didn't try and strangle my ass. Shut your ass up and grab the wall! You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga. What do you think it is? They told me. I didn't tell 'em anything. And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker. Beaumont Livingston. I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer. They asked. The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot. For what? Sure. Yeah. I got some vodka in the freezer. I was expecting you. Come in.Thanks. You betcha. It looks good on you. Are you getting that black suit? Jackie? What's that fucker ever done for us? You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help? You think I'm kidding? So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting? You already knew that? He killed a guy who works for him the other day. You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him. I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em. Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell. He told me to go outside. "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you? This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever. Gimme one anyway. Better get me another Sam's. Join me in a Jaeger shot? Great... ...Wanda! Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here. Buy ya a beer? Okay, Lou-is. You sure? Is it this aisle or the next one over? You sure? Is it this aisle, Lou-is? Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake. Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag? Fuck you. I can carry it. I'm getting out of here. What do you think? Are you sweating? That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display. Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis. All right already. ...and just take it from him. Let him and that stewardess get that money over here... Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here. I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico? Please. He went to meet that stewardess. That's not what I'm saying at all. You know where he went? He killed a man worked for him the other night. Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright. Is it dead? Now that's over, let's get to know each other. Wanna fuck? Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan. That's Japan. I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese. That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh. About five years ago. I lived there for about nine months. That's a picture of me in Japan. Did you ever go I one? C'mon, don't lie. Were you a disco guy? With Ordell? Where were you? That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then? The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco. Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos. I was pretty much the same height now as I was then. Yeah. Fourteen. Which one? No, it's what body builders drink to beef up. It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal. Want a Metrix? Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time. You okay? Yeah, there's another hit left. Really, I'm impressed. What for? Four years? How long? Where at? When did you get out of jail? Want a hit? He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am. He thinks he's Joe Gunn now. It's boring, isn't it? No problem. I was gonna tell you... Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV. Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes. 'Ola! It's Beaumont. You know it's for you.He say is a surprise. Yes'm. Sometimes every day, for a while. Most of the times. He say we like the same thing as married.
