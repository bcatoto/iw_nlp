Rush her. Holy shit. So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic? That's great! We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here... Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead. She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now. You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered. Who's the best? Say it. I'm tryin' boss. I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged? Why have we stopped? Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all. Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.? Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines! So you've not lit the last four boilers then?Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are. What? I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off. Don't you mean work me? I'm sorry. You think she was really there? What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago. That's enough. April 14, 1912.I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more. Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go. Well come on! We got room for lots more. I say we go back. Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.And to you, Mr. Andrews. Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews? Bottom, left, right. I have it. No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer. Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?! Yes, I understand. Thank you. You're certain? I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard. Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly. Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley. Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic. Is this in any way unclear? Yes, I lived. How awkward for you. I'd rather be his whore than your wife. Oh, Mother shut up! Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die. But I was with him the whole time. Something serious has happened. I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee -- I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. I was tired. The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming. My God... Cal. Is it a -- Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love? I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself. It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped. Cal, stop! It was an accident. You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...? Picasso. I felt like black. You told me to change. I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go. I promise. I can't feel my body. I'm so cold. It's getting quiet. It's so cold. You jump, I jump, right? I'm not going without you. Will this work? I'll be right back. I didn't. I just realized I already knew. I know, I know. He couldn't have. Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you -- Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right? We have to tell Mother and Cal. Could it have damaged the ship? I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it. When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you. You're trembling. Au contraire, mon cher. To the stars. He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town... I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing. A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean. Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out. Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere. Will this light do? Don't artists need good light? Fabrizio said you might be up -- I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone. It's not up to you to save me, Jack. You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really. Jack, I -- I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it? I did, didn't I? Look! A shooting star. A mistake? I don't know the steps. May I cut in, miss? Jack, must you go? Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson. I think I would. And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair. You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me? Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it. A whole ten cents?! So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit... Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head. You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free! And...? You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. I think you must have had a love affair with her... You liked this woman. You used her several times. And these were drawn from life? Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly! Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are. May I? What's this? Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world. If only it were that simple. Yes, exactly! Worse I'm afraid. Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them. Oh God, I am such an utter fool. I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry! Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion. Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you. Mr. Dawson, I -- Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater. Could I speak to you in private? HELP! HELP!! Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson. You're crazy. I know what ice fishing is! No. How cold? The fall alone would kill you. Don't be absurd. You'll be killed. You're distracting me. Go away. What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me. No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. Don't come any closer. I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett. I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it... It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. It's been 84 years... Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. It was a dreadful, heavy thing. I only wore it this once. I should like to see my drawing. There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. Isn't that right, sweetie. Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. Goodbye, mother. It's so unfair. How can you put this on my shoulders? Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day! Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson. Excuse me.There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley. Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back. You know I don't like that, Rose. Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family. So this is the ship they say is unsinkable. Rose, get in the boat! Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy. Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish? I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival. Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play. Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone! Charmed, I'm sure. My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
