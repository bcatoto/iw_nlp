Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back. I'm losing you. What? I can't hear you... Outside. Stop it... I heard a noise. Shit. No, some creep asshole trying to scare me. Alright, alright...I'll call you back. I won't. No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week... No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore. WHAAAATT? Hello? Ted? I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone? Why do you always answer a question with a question? What if I said goodbye? "Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for? I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride. We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight. Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here. Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought you were someone else. Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on. Cici. Who's this? Yes. I'll go. I don't mind. Really. Just some asshole trying to scare me. I thought you were going to the mixer? Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room. I had to change. Did anyone call? I live here.Enter Cotton Weary. Finish what my son started. Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance. I couldn�t believe you didn�t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book. Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home. Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think? And are the police sure about that? Where is Sidney's father? Hi, Gale, any leads? I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year. And much richer as a result. What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting? Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far. Cotton, I've done nothing but help you. You have a right to be angry. Did you do it? But you�ll never get away with it. What are you going to do? Jesus, you�re just as whacked as your son. You�re all in this together? Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me. No, I don't. Why don't you ask them? Home--where he lives. Tons and tons. Good for you. Do I know you? You look familiar. Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter. Fair enough. Look, I'm sorry about the face. Dewey? Let's go. Jesus Christ! Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere. This is all too familiar. Ssshh! What was that? Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum. And Joel's pre-med. ..and as lonely as I am... Dewey, you and I would never make it. Can we turn the light on? What are we looking for? Billy had alibis too. He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek? If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could? Not good. How you doin? Yeah? And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit. Mood swing. I'm manic depressive. I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry. I never meant to imply... You have every right to be upset. Oh Dewey, I'm sorry. And an explanation is, of course, out of the question. I see you read the book. I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned... Hello, Dwight. No, wait... You're getting obvious. What do you mean? What do you want from me? Oh--a God complex Where are you? What do you want? I don't play games. Who are you? Who is this? What? Sid, I'll come with you. It's good to see you involved. It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper? I'm sorry. Sidney. Hello. How are you? The safety what? Fuck that! I don�t know. Yes, goddammit! Someone�s trying to kill me. I need the police....campus security...send someone...check out...place... Hang up...call... Don't do that. Hang up...call... That's smart. I can't believe you're alone in that house. Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah... Where? What is it? It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing. Don't. Think Bailey. That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there. thought he was doing AA.Tuition�s expensive. Tails. Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip. We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings. So we found a compromise. ..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience... A twist ending if you will. And now, drum roll please... A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it. Of course not. Who wants to? What�s the point if we don�t get caught? Where�s the glamour in that? You�re the one who got away. We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you. He sent me the cutest e-mail. He hates Oliver Stone. Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on. Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive. I got it.. He seemed harmless. Randy somebody. She's got guards with her. I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together. Damned if I know. She ditched me. So you'll relieve me at 2:30... You're going to get it. You know what happens. Don't do this. What? He tried to kill her first. Too bad. Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening. I have rehearsal. I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20. Oh, Sid, you�re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious. I'm the only one who can cut him down. Can I come with her? It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to. No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed. We're missing the Sig Ep party. No, girletta, I don't leave your side. Who is that guy? That was good. I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama? What about rehearsal? Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas? Time to change numbers again? Knock yourself out.The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight. Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised. Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen. Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn. The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away. I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence. I get scared really easy, okay. You are so not funny. You ass. I'm gonna pee. You want anything? Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid.. Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot? Now. Take it off. If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie. I hate scary movies.It�s over, Cotton. Please, Cotton, don�t do this. What? Did it? Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist. How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that? I did that. What do you want from me, Cotton? I don't think that's a good idea. Cotton. But nobody wants to see that. It�ll never go. They�ll rewrite you. You don�t want that. You�re not going to get away with this. Why? No. This is a set up. It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men. No, it's not. What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it? My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends. This is exactly what I don't want. I'll get my jacket. The forbidden subject. Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge. It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper. Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo. I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks. Whatever. Dewey, there's no such place. No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence. Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat... You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here. No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it. Yeah, right. It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie. Oh my God. How could it happen? Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything? Oh my God. But who would operate your camera? My morn was a Delta. It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas. Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews. I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that... You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos.. It's not a good idea, Hallie. No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright. I'd really just like to be alone. No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me. I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please. It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside. Yeah, right. Gotta. Please, I have the perfect excuse. Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes. Hello? Hello? But... Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way. Thanks, Joel. You're not allowed to ask that. This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry? Don't panic. I'll be right back. He's after me. Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here. Thanks for the movie, Randy. I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve. I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive. Me, too. Randy. Me too. Do you work for her now? What do you want?
