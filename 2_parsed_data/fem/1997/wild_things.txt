When we graduate the only thing I'm going to miss is... Know what I mean? Kelly? Oh yeah. I'm not going to listen to this jack-off. Have a nice weekend, Mr. Lombardo. I hate to be good. Anybody in particular? Back to the land of grownups. I'd like that. So who's washing your car this weekend, Mr. Lombardo? The senior car wash, remember? Tamara's making a schedule.  She said you bought a coupon but you're not on anybody's list. Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I do it?  We're working as a team. Deal. You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one? You wouldn't want me to walk, would you? I mean like, something bad might happen. Jesus.  Where'd she get those shoes? Whores-4-Less? That's cute. I hope you swallow it. Don't forget the car wash. Is that Sam Lombardo? Hi, Mon. Sam!  Hi! What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi? Why don't you come in, have a drink? He can wait. I'll bet. Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out... What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat... This is it? Four-thirty-seven. Nice. What do you want, he's a teacher for Christ's sake. It's here.  Pull over. Sam, come on... I'm gonna be late for my game... Not that I'm going to be much good after last night... Hi, Mr. Lombardo. Look, he forgot.  I knew it. You mean that isn't yours too? Where's the hose?  We can set up. Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid? She's going to wash your Jeep? Sam the philanthropist. Tomorrow, right? Aren't  you forgetting something? Your coupon.  We gotta have it. Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo. Mr. Lombardo. We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket. Are you sure? It's hot in here, just the way you like it. Bang... Goddamnit! Hello. Jesus H. Christ! Sam, Sandy Van Ryan. Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her? Shit. Here we go again. To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday. Never mind.  I found her. Listen, Sam.  It was good seeing you the other day. I haven't found anyone else can handle the Jonathan like you can. Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what? Right. You really think you're gonna get one of these Blue Bay women to marry you? Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts. The nerve of some people. You seem to find guns therapeutic. Maybe I oughta try it. Let me guess, some boy didn't call and screwed up the weekend.  So you're taking the day off. Which one of your "bodyguards" is that? Whichever one I want. Okay, what's the matter? You notice my new jumper? My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash. I would hardly say you look like trash. No thanks to you. Come off of it. You run with all these little trust fund brats... They think money grows on trees.  It doesn't.  Believe me.  And a lot of your little friends are gonna learn that one the hard way. I'm trying to spare you that. Kelly.  What is it? I miss Dad. Jesus. Well, I do too, sometimes... No you don't. He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married. I don't know why he did it.  I really don't... Can I get you anything? What, honey?  I can't hear you. I said.  I was raped. What? I was raped. By Sam Lombardo. He... Sam Lombardo? Yes.  God, Mom... My daughter does not get raped in Blue Bay! That's right. The guidance counselor at Blue Bay? The guidance counselor at Blue Bay. We understand your feelings, Ms. Van Ryan.  But please, we'd like some time with Kelly.  We'd like to take her statement alone. Are you okay for this? The man must be insane to think he can do this to me... How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute? I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it. I know you do. We'd like to videotape the statement if that's all right with you. I know this is not pleasant, Kelly.  But these are serious charges and we need to know everything that happened between you and Mr. Lombardo. Are you ready? He started rubbing my shoulders.  Said must be sore after washing cars.  I... let him  I mean he's a nice guy. I don't know... It was so fast.  I closed my eyes.  I remember his hands moved to my breasts.  I mean just for a second it was nice... I forgot whore I was.  I mean he's so gorgeous... The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers... Take your time. They were in me.  Both places... you know. I understand. He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something. I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor. Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you? Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me... That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine. But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you? No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know... He was large? Did you try to fight him? I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.' Then what? He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped. You mean he withdrew... Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly. Try, Kelly. I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up. He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come." I don't know.  It feels wrong. I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her. I think maybe she's upset that he didn't... That doesn't make him a child rapist. There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away... I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers. All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here. You know what that will mean for Lombardo. Well you were a big help.  You know what's going to happen if we go full-bore on this. Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do. We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary. Mr. Bowden will see you now. Sam, honey... Haven't seen you in a while.  How's life treatin' you? That bad, huh?  Well, you came to the right place. And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car? Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons? Weren't you a little worried about her...? Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow. We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it. With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his. All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid. They say it was old man Van Ryan planted the melalucas to dry up the swamp. You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die. You're sure we're not lost? The skinny brunette. You mean Camp Sixty-Nine. That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place. Can I help you with something? You know the way. You won't shoot her will you?  I don't believe she's armed. Jesus.  It took you long enough.  What if somebody was trying to strangle me? Or fuck me in the ass, even? I mean, you guys are Sex Crimes. I did.  At Blue Balls. Seems to me you left early, before we could meet.  But hi, Suzie. It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are. Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo? Will they? Then he'll be back at Blue Balls? That bothers you? Yeah, maybe, a little. Why is that? You can talk to us, Suzie.  That's why we're here... Okay, Suzie.  We want you to tell us about the day Mr. Lombardo gave you and Jimmy a ride. You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news. We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us. Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride? About a year ago. He dropped Jimmy off first? Yeah. And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there? No. So you were alone. Yes. Did he come in with you? I guess. Yeah... okay... he did I wanna go home now. Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.  I know it's harder to talk here than in your room, but we need to get it on tape. Just tell us what you told us before. Tell us the truth. I didn't say a thing to him.  He just put his arm around me.  Told me I was pretty... I could be really pretty, he said. Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway... Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home? At that point were you able to fight him off? No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go. Don't touch me. He did say something. What was that? He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come." Today from Superior Court in Miami, Florida -- Dade County versus Samuel J. Lonbardo. The Lonbardo rape case has galvanized the upscale town of Blue Bay... I told him, no.  I said stop, Mr. Lombardo, please... I screamed for him to stop... No.  He raped me on the floor of his shitty house. You've got nothing to be scared of, Suzie, just take a deep breath. He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt. Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp. I said he did. This wasn't my idea. Look.  I just don't want to get into any more trouble... Mr. Lombardo didn't rape me.  He didn't rape Kelly either.  He didn't do anything. I'm sorry. I don't know.  I just wanted to hurt Mr. Lombardo. He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed. Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo, too. She's in love with him.  I mean her whole fantasy is him since her old man died.  Then she found out that Mr. Lombardo was doing her mom.  I mean that was it... You stupid little bitch... I hope you're going to nail his scrotum to the nearest wall. Fuck off. You're going to let them get away with this... this shit?  On the word of one little white trash bitch... You've got to be kidding. I'm not paying any idiot twenty million dollars. I hope you're happy. Ecstatic. Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you... Why don't you start fucking her again. You can spend it together. I hate you! So you got my mom's money. How much? How much? Your turn to pay. King Dong!  That's you, Sam! It worked!  We screwed the bitch! It worked just like you said it would. Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom. How much is about six and a half million divided by three? Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party. Do it to ourselves? Stick? Lombardo's settlement? Yeah, well, I told you they were gonna make us look stupid. Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial. Unless what? Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life. He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing... So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father... This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it? Eliminate the competition. Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway? Is there some reason why you're here? About what?  How to improve your breast stroke? Excuse me? You're out of your mind. Police -- God -- get a life. You don't know Duquette.  I'm the one he busted... He's a fucker, man... He'll fuck us both over... I'm not going back to that prison. That's what it was... a fucking hell hole... Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him. Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me... Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit. Man, I wanna smoke a joint. You got something against cigarettes? That's cop bullshit. About what? Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle? I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now... I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends... Get away from me. Shut up. Davy. I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you? I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust. You can trust me. Yes. You know what it takes. Yeah, right.  Can you at least talk to her, on the phone? Sam... I'm here. But I.. Right. Yeah, right. You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you? Oh, for Christ's sake. You are. Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp... That's what I am to you, isn't it? Swamp trash.  It's what I am to everybody, just like my mom... Stupid bitch. Why do you make me hurt you?  It's like you want it or something. God, you are scared, aren't you? And this is going to make you feel better, make you trust me... Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life. You could say that. We all have... Thanks. Quite a shopping spree... I didn't mean... And where might that be? I love Antigua. Maybe I'll come visit you. Jesus.  What are you drinking? Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain? What brain? What are you looking at? Nothing. I thought we were goin' to a movie. I think we just need to get wasted. I wanna live at the beach someday. Shit. I left the keys.  I'll get 'em. Kelly? Kelly? Are you mad at me? There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb... My mom would kill me if she knew I took the Rover. Get off my property. She's been sayin' she was going to go to L.A.  But I don't know.  I mean all her clothes are still here.  An' she's missin' her graduation. She should graduate.  She's a smart girl... Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere... You have someplace to be? If you want company... You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me... I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight. Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip. Where, the mall? A friend of mine bought a boat. Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth. Where's the body? Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal. We don't know that, Ray... Ray, you heard him... And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up? Hello? God, I've been calling you. I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me. I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something... I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit... I don't know. I want to see you... But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber... Okay.  I love you too. Suzie Toller is missing. She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket. Ray thinks she was murdered. You could tell me where you were last night. Looks like goodbye. Suzie? Why didn't you tell us about this before the trial? I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home. He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit. It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track... Ray? Shit.  Ray. Who is it? Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about? You can't... Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides. That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth. What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway? Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye. He don't use it for no good deeds anyway. You come all the way out here to watch Walter? I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. About Suzie? Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette. He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades. Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear. She still work there? No.  Not after that night. I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night. It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette. Was there ever any kind of investigation... Duquette always claimed the kid was dusted, came after him with a knife. But it was Jack's Fish Camp... This could be the moon for all most people care. Wasn't supposed to be like that though. This place was supposed to be something once.  There were going to be roads and houses.  There was going to be a town. They were going to call it Salt Creek. Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. Nice move.  Good thing I was here to save your incompetent ass. Shoulda, coulda, woulda... Get him in the water. Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's? I like these joint survivorship accounts.  Something unfortunate happens to one of the signatories, the others don't have to worry.  Are you worrying, Ray? Men, use 'em abuse 'em lose 'em. Feeling better? The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that. But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends. What? Poor Ray. Come on Sam, we did it.  We put the screws to the Van Ryans.  We won. Talk about paranoid.  Now are you gonna teach me to sail this big old boat or not? Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive. You asked if Suzie knew about the Salt Creek land deal?  Girl read every book she could find on it, the Van Ryans too. Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp. That came with her. And the child... She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child... Suzie. Then you're not her grandmother... Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child. He was a good boy, till the army took him. So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters. And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece. Thank you for talking to me, Ruby.  I am sorry about Suzie, she... You okay? I'm fine.  Nice TV. There's an old saying from the Everglades -- virtue may be missed but sin can't hide. Folks pay in the end. You've got the pressure too tight. You'll crush the fucking evidence. That never seemed to worry you at the Glades. Say you love me. No little girl can ever make me come. Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met. Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me. Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend. You like bein' a caddy for rich kids' problems? I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it. What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back? Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already. Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold. I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo? I'm running away. Um-huh.  And guess what else? I have toys. Selling your boat? I wouldn't have guessed Suzie was a sailor.
