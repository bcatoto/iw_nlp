Left at the corner. He's got nothin'. Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street  before you get run over. Joe, wake  up! You're in the street, Joe. Get outa  the street. Other way, Joe. Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better  off right there. I don't think you'd  even feel it. Who is it? Put it on the table. Yes. Take a sleeping pill. There's some  in my purse. I already worked for that. For who? So what's your excuse? I think this is breaking and entering,  isn't it? Learn anything you didn't already  have on file? I'll make sure you get them. Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna  donate your heart, make sure it goes  to science. Most people want one  that beats. Don't get so clever. It's out of  character. What's so interesting up there? Then why's it got all your attention? About us? Good. Don't waste your time. Where's it gonna get us? I don't wanna hear 'em. Plans just  make you think somethin's gonna get  better. I'm fine now. I don't need  to get screwed up waitin' for  something good to happen. Me, too. Why're you telling me this? Just don't ask me to marry you. It's the middle of the day. Since when? Good, I need the money. I got perishables, okay? What? Jesus, does anybody -- You scared the hell outa me. ...What? What'm I supposed to say? This is all I need to do right? Okay, okay. But this is it. I'm not  doin' anything more than this. I know him. I know him. No. I fucking know him. You don't understand. Third man from the left. I know him. He hangs around my  building. He lives in the alley or  something. What paper? Now why the hell would they think  something like that? You said all I had to do was pick  him out. How come you're so sure it was him? Bullshit. He didn't do it. Better him than you. -- when the defendant, Clyde Dunner,  entered the house of George and Carol  Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber  pistol in his hand. He entered the  house with one thing in mind. To  kill George and Carol, the people he  blamed for the break up of his  marriage to Carol's sister, Paula. George and Carol were watching a  movie when he entered the living  room and opened fire. George was  killed instantly, hit in the face.  Carol died later of three bullet  wounds to her chest. Then the defendant, in his effort to  cover up the crime, doused them with  lighter fluid and set the house on  fire... Carol was still alive. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we  will prove to you, beyond any  reasonable doubt, that the defendant,  Clyde David Dunner, is guilty of two  counts of murder in the first degree. What's wrong? What're you talking about? What?! -- I don't have a goddamn case without  the goddamn gun. His fingerprints,  the ballistics, everything! I have  to have the fucking gun or he's gonna  walk. That murdering piece of filth  will go free without the .44. How  could they lose it?! -- and when you approached the suspect  in his apartment, did you identify  yourself as a police officer? Did the suspect respond? In what way? The Defendant fired six times, until  his gun was empty. We would like to  show you the weapon he used. And we would like to enter it into  court records. It was the same Smith  and Wesson revolver he used to  viciously murder George and Carol  Beaman. The prosecution would like to call  Mr. Steven J. Allen to the stand. Mr. Allen, would tell the court what  you do. Your honor, can we have a moment? Your honor, my colleague's client  admits to the killing. I don't see  any reason to go through a trial  when it's obvious he would like to  plead guilty. If he wants to plead guilty, you  have to let him plead guilty. Come on, Elliot! What the hell, Joe, at least you  won't get run over. Who the hell're you and what the  fuck are you doing in here?! Yeah, yeah, nice try, get out. What the hell's this?! A subpoena?! For what?! I didn't do  anything! Oh shit... oh shit. He served me! He  fuckin' served me! What the hell're you doing? Now? What time is it? Frank, this is no way to repair our  marriage, you know? Frank, I can't do this. He came to  the club. You gotta -- I thought you said all I had to do  was pick him out?! That's what you  said, that's all I had to do. I did  what you said. But that was supposed  to be all. They want me in court. You promised me I wasn't gonna have  to do anything! What the hell is  goin' on?! I can't do this, Frank. I can't go  into court. I'm gettin' outa here! Well I can't go to court! THAT'S NOT Fine. Think away. -- What?! What did I see?! Hello. ...yeah. Yeah. I'm ah... pretty busy. Yeah, okay... two. What are you telling me?! She missed the appointment? She forget  you were coming? What?! She split, our witness split... Can't  we keep our evidence and witnesses  from disappearing around here? I  mean what do I have to do, lock them  in the trunk of my car? What the  fuck is going on?! I want that bitch  back here and on the stand or in  jail! Yes. What the hell? I don't... believe so, your honor. What an asshole. -- when he pulled this gun and fired  at the driver of the car. Killing  him instantly. Let the record show  that this is the weapon used in the  crime, a Smith and Wesson forty-four  caliber handgun. And when you arrested the defendant,  did he deny that he had killed Agent  Hudd. Can you describe the defendant's  condition at the time of his arrest. We have the blood test report that  shows -- -- that he had four times the legal  limit to drive. The people would  like to enter this into evidence. Where? When? Well who the hell was that? What the fuck is going on?! Your honor, the people call Ms.  Cynthia Webb to the stand. Sure. Please state your name for the court. Cynthia Webb. Do you see the man that you identified  in a police line-up in this room. Yes. Is it the defendant, Mr. McCall? Yes. Please describe what you saw the  night of September 14th. I was comin' out of an all night  minimart -- And you're positive the man you saw  with the gun is the defendant. Yeah. No further questions. Yes. No. When you lie. You go to jail. Objection. The witness has already  answered that question. Yes. What did I buy? ...shampoo I think. Yes. 4356 17th Street. Number 37. Close? Sort of. I don't really know. No... I don't think so. I ahh... drove. Yeah. ...to the corner. Objection. Your honor, I don't see a  point to this line of questioning. In the middle I think. ...yeah. Um... there were lots of cars parked  on the street. No. I don't remember. I didn't see anybody else. Yes. I went home. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. Objection. Defense is trying to  confuse the witness. Objection! He lived in the alley next to my  apartment building. Oh shit. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't understand. Why can't you  tell me who put up the bond? Was it a cop? I don't like this. What'd he look like? This was the big secret? Shit. You're  an asshole. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You're full of shit. Where's Divinci? You're gonna find him? Right... I don't know a fuckin' thing. What attorney? I got nothin' to say. ...how? Life moves in such strange ways. Oh,  I just think what might've happened  to you had you not been arrested for  killing that poor policeman. You  still might be on the street. Joe, you look wonderful. After what  you've been through... I just can't  imagine. What d'you want? This is all I've got. They'll catch you. You wanna bet? So tell me about your plans. I think  I'd like to hear 'em now. I shouldn't've done a lotta things  in my life. But that's not one of  'em. I heard it was a cop's heart. He was shot in the head a couple  hours ago. They think it was gang related.
