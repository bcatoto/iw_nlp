He's not too bad. I can live with him. No, I'm fine. Maybe I ought to think about getting another job. It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh. When was the last time we laughed? Any of us? About Charles... Let's get a coffee. Nothing ever really changes, does it, David? 0 my god. At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you. Honestly David, you're so spineless. Meaning? Great. You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. Did you? Hi..... Roses. Now what does that mean? My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing? That tie's God-awful. Why do you wear it? David, I'm serious! Shut up, Kevin. Honey, you-re not making sense ... Your face smells like a foot. Liar. There were three strawberries. Go ahead. I need some time, David. A little time. It's not just you. It's partly me. It isn't working any more, David. What's wrong with you, David? All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go. Did you really ask? Scottish. It's the last thing we need. David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'? Do we know anything about him? And what did you say? There aren't hotels? Yeeees? Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.David. There's a call for you. It's your wife. Big day today, huh? 78 Night. Excuse me. Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs. I can understand THAT. Neither do I. He doesn't like to say much does he? Oh, right, yeah. two dollars please. Two dollars please.Bye, Dad. It's you and Mom that need to talk. There's a man. I woke up next to a man ... Welsh again. Welsh. All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors. Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep. All Englishmen are ugly. Come on Sting! Of course he is. It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga. You. You know the thing I hate most about children? Shut up, Kevin.It is urgent, sir. We need you urgently in C Theatre. Doctor Jacobson?
