Zander, no...! Zander, what are you doing ? Is it true ? I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ? I don't know, Zander. Yeah. A funeral. No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool. Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different... Excuse me...! No, funny there's almost no wounded at all. Funny... So who's got time to get married ? There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too... You weren't thinking...you were dreaming ! Zander, please... Let's go ! Johnny, wait... Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now. It looks like an... asteroid. WHERE IS IT ? I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet... You and me, huh ? Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ? Don't change the subject. Am I right ? Hey, check it. No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way. Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever. Oh, I see... teamwork. Or...? Oh, yes, sir. Vector ? In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up. It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate. Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ? Hey ! What are you doing here ? Johnny, this is Zander. Don't you have to finish the game ? Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ? Are you alright ? Which way ? AAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Take care, wilya Johnny ? Well, look at this. The three of us back together again. Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K. You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it. I thought you were KIA, Johnny... No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here. ...I'm sorry. Johnny...! I thought you were dead ! What's wrong with you ? Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us. You don't look very happy to see me. It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying. What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ? I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will. I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write ! Alright, I love you. I'll miss you, too, Johnny. You talk to Carl ? Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad. My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go. Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what. Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl ! Hey, Carl, what's wrong ? Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse. I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...? Shhh... You're right. Let's never stop... Everyone's looking... we shouldn't... Are you the boy for me ? He's nothing like you. Johnny Rico, you're jealous ! Zander is going for pilot, too. No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance. He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ? Good luck at the academy. I'll meet you outside. Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation... How do I know if this is love ? Sometimes I do what I want, eh ? It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran. Johnny, my Dad's home today. I thought you were going to help Carl. You can't walk me home. How come that's all you talk about anymore ? I don't want everyone to see. Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers. Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing. Excuse me...! Eeuch ! Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical She's flying starships ! Your turn... No way, ma'am ! This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...! Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ? Plasma, ma'am... from the planet. Thank you, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am ! Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny... I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ? Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group... What frequency ? I'm on it ! Planet P ? What kind of name is that ? What ? Well, excuse me, sir... You used to dance... C'mon... Way to go, amigo ! That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen ! You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny. If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo. It stinks, you goin. You got it. High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score... Flip six, three hole. What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ? What's your malfunction, Rico ? Hey, amigo, come chow with me. Guess you gotta go. Sure. How come we never got together ? Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start. Too bad for her if she's not around. Hey, Rico, wanna dance ? You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ? Hut... hut !This time of the year...? Oh, my, what's that ? We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite. Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ? Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach ! Good good, then it's all settled. Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do... Well, of course you should come home immedietly ! Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you... Hello... Oh, Johnny...! I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform. Johnny, please. Calm yourself. Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ? Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile. You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ? Good luck. It's not there anymore. Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
