Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car... We can go anywhere. Up the stairs - down the hall. We gotta get the stuff and get out of here. You killed him. You all right? You got him. Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete? Are you my man? I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else... To a girlfriend's house. But, we still have a coupla things to take care of... Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny. 'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby. Set. Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night. I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay? That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here. So, should I call Andy? If you want me to go away, I'll go away. No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man. It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job... Pete... Don't... Yeah. He makes films for Mr. Eddy. He works for Mr. Eddy. No, honey... It was part of the deal. I used to. No... no. I don't know. I'm not positive... but... he knows. He'll kill us. Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes. I'll call you again. Pete? I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you. I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy. I can't see you tonight. It's me... Okay, baby. Can I call you? I want more. Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi. Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner. How would you like to take me to dinner? I was here yesterday.We saw you that night, Pete. No... Here he comes. Out in back. Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something. Pete, what happened to you? I want to see him. He didn't come home. When he went to work, right. I wouldn't know how. He won't give his name. We know that. What's the matter? Do you remember? Coming up.I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian. Do they aim for the head or for the heart? Which would you choose? They're gonna cook him. Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe. No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key. No. No. Fred hates them. What is? Was there? Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here? I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay... It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job... But... I thought you were getting me a drink? But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why? I don't know. Maybe a hotel. Why would anyone do something like this? On the tape! There was something else on the tape. What was that?!!! What the hell is going on?! We will. Two detectives are coming out. We've got to call the police. I guess so. Yes, I just found it on the step. That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up. Yeah? I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I? Called? When? Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one. What night? Huh?... oh, yeah, it is. It must be from a real estate agent. No, nothing. I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it. A videotape. Wake me up when you get home. I like to laugh, Fred. I thought I'd stay home and read. You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!! YOU'RE SORRY!! What's the BITCH'S name?! You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is. You've been fucking somebody else haven't you? I didn't know you cared. I was? Where'd you come from? Why don't you like me? I don't know. What do you want? No... I really don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it... It was weird... You really don't remember? You still care about me? You were acting like a different person. You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known. Last time I saw you. What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night. What's happening to you? What happened to your face? Why haven't you called me? You want some company? What are you guys doin'? Yeah. I missed you.
