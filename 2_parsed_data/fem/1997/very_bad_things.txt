"The Oakland Raiders have taken a 7 -  6 lead in a, tough, football game  and this crowd is standing..." "Hang on to your hats, here come the  Steelers out of the Huddle..." "It comes down to one big play, 4th  down, ten yards to go. Terry Bradshaw  at the controls..." "And Bradshaw, back and  looking...Again, Bradshaw running  out of the pocket... Looking for  someone to throw to..." ...Bradshaw fires it down the field  and there's a collision!..." "...and it's caught out of the air!  The ball is pulled in by Franco  Harris!" Franco Harris running for the end  zone, all but home..." This is ridiculous. Why can't we do it through the mail? Can't we do it on the phone? Why is this Kid staring at me? Did you send in all of the deposit  checks? What do you mean, you think so? The wedding cake check? Photographer? Florist? Caterer? Hotel for my parents, the tent, the  band, the Judge... You forgot the tent? Why? Why did you forget the tent check? You can't play around with these  tent people. What else have you forgot? I'm working my ass off here. I've  taken care of absolutely everything  Keith. Don't you dare. Don't you put this on me. Don't do  it, don't do it, don't do it, don't... You know how important this is to my  mother. You know that. I bet you didn't forget the bachelor  party checks. I'm just saying I bet those checks  all found the mailboxes. It amazes me how organized you and  your little fun bunch can be when it  comes time to mobilize to Vegas. Well it's bad timing. Right before the wedding? I suppose Boyd is the creative force  behind all this. He's a moron. David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas. Why do you feel the need to explore  this side of your personality? I'm talking about the kind of people  you hang out with... about growing  up, assuming responsibility of  yourself. I just think that at some point you're  going to have to re-evaluate some of  your friendships... Charles Moore for instants. It's not that I don't like him. But  the wedding has really got me thinking  and... I just keep myself opening  up. Growning. And I want you keeping  up with me here. I just don't see him in the big  picture. He's weird. He's weird. Why? What's his problem? He's weird. And I expect more from  you. You're going to be hungover for three  days. Like those guys on "Oprah"  that get drunk and have disgusting  sex with prostitutes and then say  their vows with the stench of cheap  hotel whore sex all over them. It's vile! I've seen it on television. I am not common Keith. I am not  common. I am a creature like no other  and I will not be commoned! Is that  to much to ask? Is that to much to ask!?! Marriage license please. Do you love me? How much? Kiss me...? We've got problems here. Seating problems. Keith do not trivialize this. We're supposed to have gold-trimmed  padded seats, now they're telling me  that there was a mistake and we can't  have padded. Not padded ones. You go down there. Go down to the seat place and  straighten this out. I need your help. I need your help. Do you love me? Take care of those chairs. Maybe. ...embarrassing, shameful... The stone age. A mutant species. Will you please call the chair people? Do you love me? Just call and let me know that your  okay. Have a nice bachelor party. Hello. Hi. Are you calling from jail? Well, the night is young. Did you  straighten out the chair situation? That's sweet. Well you should. Just a bit of organizing. Yeah. Nesting. Go have fun. Not too much. Who's the lucky groom? Hi Fisher. You said just dancing. With him. Lucky me. Oh come on. It's gonna cost extra. Easy baby, easy. Hello. Where are you? How late? What about the chairs? What okay? The chairs. You sound funny. Did you do cocaine? Do you love me? What's the word on the chairs? Then you'd better work on it in the  car. We gotta go see the Judge. I kind of like "till death do us  part." I mean, this is forever. In  sickness and in health, through good  times and bad. Honey, what do you  think? We don't think so. I mean, we just  want the singing when I come out. We're just going to have the leader  of the band sing alone with his  guitar. Acoustic. "You Send Me." You know, Darling you... you send me... Darling  you... You mend me. Honey, sing it for Judge Tower. "At first I thought it was  infatuation... But oh it's lasted so  long..." I love it. I just love, love, love,  love it. Are you guys gonna fill this place  with kids? You sure got room for  them. We're in no hurry. I think we'll  take some time to enjoy each other,  enjoy our freedom before we surrender  ourselves to kids. Take your time. I wish I had. We will. So where to on the honeymoon? After the wedding, which we're paying  for ourselves, and this house... Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big  picture, take your time. I wish I  had. That's our plan. Well, I just need your signature on  these contracts and a deposit check  so I can get the ball rolling. Five percent should be fine for now,  which is, let's see, twenty thousand  dollars. Of course I'll be splitting  my commission with your friend. He is a very sweet man. Keith? Is everything okay, honey? Well, can you come back inside? Now? Keith?! Are they fighting? Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of  your fucking mind?! No way. Talk what out? We are locked and  loaded here. We are non-refundable.  I've got relatives on the airport  right now! I've got... Answer it! We're not canceling. I won't even discuss it. I need you to pick up the cake  tomorrow. Yeah. You. My god. Money? What does that mean? No. Well, oh... So where's that leave us? Get away from me! I don't want your help! Tomorrow We are getting married tomorrow. It's okay... It's okay baby. Cry for  Mama. Cry for Mama. Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay. Don't even. What? What kind of stupid question is that? What are you talking about? Who's dead? You fucked a prostitute? You killed a prostitute. Call the police. My God. You've got to call the police,  tell them it was an accident. Where  is she? You left a dead prostitute out in  the desert? Alone? Stop! You stop right here. I don't  want to know anymore. I told you not  to do this Bachelor Party thing. You  were warned. No buts. I told you your friends  were Jackasses. No buts. I've waited twenty-seven  years, twenty-seven years I have  focused and prepared to walk down  that aisle. I will not be derailed!  I will not be embarrassed! I will  not be denied! I am walking down  that aisle tomorrow come hell or  high fucking water! I told Boyd two fucking minutes! Here comes the bride. I do. What does that mean? Like how? The only proof is those bodies. Move the bodies. Thank you. Thank you. We will. Bye  bye. You and Moore move the bodies and  bury Boyd with them. In fact, put  Moore in the ground too. If you don't tie up all the lose  ends it'll never be over. You put him down or don't bother  coming back. Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?! And it's Franco Harris running for... A TOUCHDOWN FOR PITTSBURGH!
