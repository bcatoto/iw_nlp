Hurry, Grandmama! "Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?! Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris? I know, but I had to because . . . How to read. I was showing Sonya something . . .Then come find me. Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do. I have to go now, before it gets light. I'm not sure but look. . . No. I'm running to . Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend! Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money. Poor Meetoo! Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him! Not you. Him. You'll laugh. No! I look ridiculous! You must have. I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess! Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly... Who's Sophie? I'm fine. Noooo.... Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . . Well, I don't have any money . . . I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri? Don't let me go! Dmitri? I'm glad you did too. No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie! Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money! I'm so scared... Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana.... Oh! I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home. Lost. it feels lost. This was hers? It's so beautiful ... and sad. You said you wouldn't laugh! What a beautiful ship! The dessert fork! ...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . . [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE] Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie! You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess! You shouldn't have pushed us! No! HUH?! Forged papers! Now, what?! Just what do you think you're doing?! Why? I'm going to stretch my legs By pulling my hair?! Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging. Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . . Look at me! I have my reasons. I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me. I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . . AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER. I'm sorry. . . I'm. . . I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ... I don't know who I am! I still don't know! And this is my future. This is who I am! I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you. "If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted! Why does everyone have to act that way? Dmitri didn't want the money? Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear... No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think... ... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything. THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ... I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...Oh, heavens, no... but ... She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect. Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls. Oh, heavens - I must say, yes. Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!Get on! Anastasia, get on! When you're older . . . It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . . I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore. What were you showing her? Why were you so late tonight And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home. Yes, you do. You do. This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you. You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself. Is it? Is this what you want? You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown... No, he just wanted to know you were happy. No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make. Don't you, child? No, no child... shush... it's all right ... Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear... Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home... PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER Do you remember this? Who are you, child? Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could. She does. That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you? Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you? You are the boy ... Young man, I... I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it. I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years... You could have found it... You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately! Remove him at once. How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
