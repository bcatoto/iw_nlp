I hope she gets better. Say hi to Zoe. Alison. Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens. What happened? What happened? I...don't think so. That's okay. What...does it turn to? She's in trouble? But you said... Then...when did she get better? So there were others? I don't remember the name. It was near a beach. Which one? Not really. The last time I saw her was at that clinic. That was a long time ago. I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay. And Zoe? How's Zoe? I'd heard that. But she's well? How is Mrs. Stephens? He used to work with you. Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife. I'm fine. Still working with my father. How are you? Ally. That was my nickname. Yes, we do know each other. I'm Alison Jones.I don't know. But it was weird in terms of what happened next. Sean was still watching his mother. He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole. He looked frightened. Yes. Abbot understands these things. Anything you didn't understand? You heard what Abbott said? Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling? Who should care about what I'm feeling? What other people? And Billy told you that he'll tell that to... You've talked to Billy? Billy said that? He knows that? Billy? Because I'd be to blame, right? I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened. That's how I remembered it. But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty. Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then? I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens. The Walkers loved Sean. He was their only child...the object of all their attention. I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man. That's his nature. But Risa, she's still got dreams. What do you mean? That's right. What do you mean? A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him. He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six. With our hands. Yes. The old-fashioned way. Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring. Yes. Like I was putting them into my big basket. Clearing the hillside of its children. That's the way I thought of them sometimes. No. I saw it on his face. No, nothing like that. Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago. He took over raising the children by himself. It was obvious how much he missed Lydia. From what? Billy loved to see his kids in the bus. They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him. Those are all from the fair last year. Abbott and me were judges at the pet show. Oh yes. Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school. It's like he was their little treasure. He was such a beautiful boy. That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott. No, nothing like that. The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions in a respectful way. They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers. I mean, the way they look. Their hair and clothing... About the Ottos? Dolores. No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'. The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear. They were the only parents who did that, together like that. I guess they're what you might call hippies. Oh, it's bizarre alright. C'mon Bear. Let's get you out of here. I'll just strap it on the roof. I didn't say that. Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting. Good morning, Wanda. Hi, Hartley.She's resting. In her room. Billy, please. The children. Why would he do that? You didn't have anything to do with the accident. Nicole! Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey? Want me to fix you something? No. From Mr. Stephens. That was him on the phone just now. He was calling to see how you were. Yes. It's a present. Your Dad spent all his spare time in here. He wanted to make it absolutely perfect. So do you like your new room? We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam? Well, winter's far behind us now. Summer's over. It's fall. Isn't it a lovely day? Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left. That's what he said. Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed. No. That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.Goodnight, Mr. Ansel. Oh. Right. What do you mean 'outgrown it'? No. I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that. I really liked her. I don't know. It just seems...kind of weird. Are you sure? Okay. Was it good? Hi, Mr. Ansel. Hi, Jessica, Mason... It's the truth. No. What's this lawyer business? Who's Mr. Stephens? From you? Is this mine? I feel like a princess. It's interesting. How was it? And winter? What happened to summer? He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein. It wasn't. I feel like his monster. Should I keep reading? No. Not mean. Just...very angry. Yes. Because...he wanted to them to be punished. That's right. What, Mason? Okay. Don't you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad? Yes. Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats... It's like a song. The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty... It was snowing. Why? Dolores. You seem very sure about that. The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame. I won't lie. What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens? Yes. Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and... You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long. Then you start to feel...unlucky. I don't like thinking about the accident. I don't even remember it happening. Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and... I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything. And that's all. I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all. Then I was in the hospital. Yes. I do now. Now that I'm telling it. No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed. I was scared. And there wasn't time. No. Yes. I told you I was positive. The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was. Positive. Seventy-two miles an hour. Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared. The speedometer. And it was downhill there. Dolores was driving too fast. Yes, I understand. I was scared. Before the actual accident? Yes. There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods. And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual. I remember that. I'm remembering it pretty clearly. Yes. As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it. Yes. No. Until the accident? No. Yes, there was. My usual place. On the right side. The first seat. Yes. Like what? I mean, I don't remember a lot. No. I was alone. My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day. About eight-thirty in the morning. Yes. Someplace where no one knows her. Someplace strange and new. She'll move away. Will the police do anything to her? What's going to happen to Dolores? How about Sunday night? That's always the best time. Great. He couldn't look at me. But I looked at him. Right at him. His secret was mine now. We used to share it. But not anymore. Now, I owned it completely. I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star. Not like you used to tell me. Remember, Daddy? All the people that were going to discover me? Where are they now? Great. No. As opposed to this T.V.? Nothing. How will he do that? What about insurance? Doesn't insurance pay for these things? But you didn't lose me. My lawyer? Why do I need a lawyer? You and Mom have a lawyer? That's too high. I'll never reach it. The door needs a lock. It's okay. Very slick. The ramp? They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident. Mrs. Ansel's clothing. Nothing. Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals. It's like the biggest thing in her life. You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure. You mean it? Really?Why did you do that, Billy? Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses? That she was wearing it when the bus crashed? Because I have to. I have to. ...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough. Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus... Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was. Good night, Billy. You're leaving. Just like we look forward to this. They can look forward to that. Your kids never cry. Yes. Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus. He won't want to go. He never does. He'll cry and want to hold on to me. When the game's over, I guess. No. It should be dry by now. Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking. Have you been waiting long? Can't you make it later? Billy, that's too early. No. Wanda does these photographic things. That's one of her pictures on the wall. Crafts. They're smart. Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago. Yes. Wanda and Hartley. They lost Bear. He was their adopted son. A beautiful boy. Indian. There's the Prescots... What do you mean? ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and... At school. She fell for Kyle just before we graduated. Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle... She...she was a friend of mine. Will you be spending more than a night? You don't know that. The Ottos. But Charlene... Well, there's the Hamiltons. Joe and Shelly Hamilton.I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate. Yes. We do. Poached salmon. I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish? Some more wine?Away from your crazy Mom. It's for the school bazaar. I could wrap it up. Protect the other kids. You hate it. What do you think? Hi, Dolores. Do you have this agreement with you? Are you expensive? Isn't that what you want us to believe? That we're completely defenseless? That you know what's best? So you're just the thing we need. You think someone else caused the accident? Dolores? Who did they get for that? Their child died, and they got a lawyer. You've been retained? No. You can't come here. Who are you?
