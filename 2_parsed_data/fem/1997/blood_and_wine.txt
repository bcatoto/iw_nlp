Oh, you have competition. Okay. Show me. So what is it? I'm not wearing any. Tell me now. He kisses her wet breast. Don't think you have to say it because .1 say it, Alex. Doesn't mean anything.. We're good together, aren't we. Alex lets out a breath. The TOASTER OVEN DINGS. Jason takes out a muffin, it in two with his fishing knife. is a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense of humor and irony. She's chemically relaxed, but not stupefied. She pulls a robe around herself, modest in front of her son; and although her body's not spectacular, like Gabriella's, she has a trim. athletic build. Maybe he hadn't finished- I don't like that tone from: you. It's too late for this. He's my husband. -- I still love him. Lie down, I'll give you a back rub. She stumbles slightly against the bed, catches a bed post for balance, flops back on the bed with a laugh. -- maybe I'd better lie down. He bends down to kiss her, then heads for the television. Suzanne props herself up on her elbows. He pops a cassette into the VCR: porno, she assumes. She does her best. I liked the twin nurses. There was kind of a story. Alex brings the remote control back to bed. Rio? If we really go. Last time I packed, we went nowhere. (watching the tape) The beaches -- I thought we had a beach. I read how the hotels keep spotters on the roof with scopes, to keep thieves away from the guests. They can look at every inch of your body through the scope. (with a low laugh) Do you mind that I like that? Alex? He has fallen asleep. Tenderly she draws the sheet to his shoulder and settles down to watch the rest of the tape. Oh, the boss himself! How do you do. Is the wine for the boat? Come through the house. -- what's the point of having it, if I can't wear it, Frank? I'll show you, come on. ugly, isn't it. He grins and relaxes, looks around. Oh, a boat type. I'm not going, 'I can't go. Iâ€¢don't have a green card, I can't leave the country. Baby goes with an American nurse. I house-sit. It's fine. God. I'm obvious. I just don't like working for people, but that's life. He chafes under authority the same way she does. Maybe not with a rich stepfather. He laughs. No. You don't appreciate what you have, Jason. It's very poor where I came from. Venezuela. Do I look it? Well, I don't. My mother's Indian. The India kind of Indian. Imagine a house where the father asks 'What's for dinner' in Spanish, and the mother answers 'Curry' in Hindi. 'Que hay para cenar' she says, 'Murgee, masala, ghaal.' He says, 'No es importante.' No wonder I'm nuts. You don't know mel The alternative is using your fingers, Frank. which offends you more? Alex laughs. Frank pushes back his chair. Just open the bottle, Alex. Pour us both a glass. I'm not allowed to drink alone. When she turns her head and looks at him, she's flirting. Yes, Mrs. Reese. Right there. She slides off the stool. He.'s ready for his nap. Did you pick the wine, sweetie? It's lovely. Frank grins, pleased. His hand curves around her shoulder. He has forgotten about the other vendor present, the agent. Don't sneak up on me that way! What are you doing? She snatches the necklace away from him and fairly runs down the hall to Frank's study. You're going to get me fired and deported. We're both crazy. It's vulgar. (eyeing the champagne) What'd you do this time? He's too pumped to take offense. Whenever you open champagne -- it's such a giveaway. He pours her a glass. You know, I've-never actually seen you play poker -- maybe poker doesn't even exist. Maybe it's just a cover story men use. He laughs. Hey; lightning strikes. He fills his glass. I was charging the groceries today, and they kept the card. We'd been cancelled. I felt about as big as an ant. Alex takes out a credit card. It's the third time this year. Alex, what are we doing together? We don't talk -- -- we don't fuck -- we don't even eat dinner together anymoret (hard, flat) No. -- enough of an investment in there -- A month alone with Frank. Alex chuckles as he starts to inspect the humidifier. The first one was bad enough. She's standing too close to him, but he has no room to maneuver away. He fiddles with the box. Nice suit. You always dress well, Alex. She brushes the lint off his jacket and leaves her hand there. How can you tell? She moves up against him. Alex can't will himself to resist. His knee automatically separates her legs. He reaches out to close the door. Mrs. Reese? The baby's ready for -- Thank you, Gabriella. Dina spies some interaction between Gabriella and Alex, and her pretty face hardens. Did you leave him by himself? Just to get his sheets. That's the maid's job. He's in his playpen. Dina sweeps out. Baby jail. She looks over her shoulder to make sure Gabriella is behind her. Are you coming? Thanks, Alex. You'll walk yourself out? See you in a month. Alex watches the two women move down the hall. -- where he can reach me. Hi, Jason. I was supposed to let him into the Reeses'. No, I'm not. She's walking toward the door. I just got fired, all right? She goes out. You don't know anything! I liked.the money! I liked having a.roof! They shed on the couch I'll have to sleep on. You know how long it took me to find that job? Everybody thinks they're running for office. You don't have papers, they don't even want to meet you. And the only real way to get legal is to get married. Do you understand? He opens her car door for her. ... Are you old enough to vote? She slides behind the wheel. (as he climbs in) Aren't you working? Well, let's not tell the boss I stole you. Just. They said they.were -- downsizing. Jason laughs. The size of their staff? It is. Not for the wharf. Idiot! Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Mike starts down the stairs. Alex signals to Victor that he's going with him and follows Mike away. Victor waits until he hears the DOOR CLOSE before dropping down through the hatch and heading for Frank's office. Will you teach me? He laughs. I'm only investing an afternoon. She takes in the landscape, breathing in the lovely isolation. Where are we? No more? Jason concentrates on securing the boat. I don't know if I would like boats after that. He smiles. How old were you? I am not taking my clothes off. I can't. He sits up, offended. Because it felt good, and I'm an idiot! He fondly touches her face with the back of his hand. I want to go back now. Can we go back, please? What? Me, too. Where are we going? Not Anywhere you are, I want to be there. Sure. Where are you going? Alex recovers quickly. Via New York? She holds up the tickets. You're amazing, you really are. Now how are you going to explain 'Miss Vasquez?' God, I could even believe you, if I wanted to. I put Terry's life insurance money into that store -- and you spend it on your goddamn girlfriends while my checks bounce. Alex whirls around at the bottom of the stairs. -- You're going to talk to me! With more of your fucking lies! I hate you! Wasting my (slapping at his arm with her free hand) -- life! That's all you ever do! He twists her hand up behind her back, forcing her onto the sofa. Go to hell! He smothers her into the cushion and twists her hand up and up. She grips his keys tighter. You sonofabitch! He hits her back, her nose starts to gush, the keys drop to the-floor. He bends to pick them up. Suzanne seizes a standing metal ashtray and savagely swipes him across the temple. -- Don't go in therel We're Is he dead? -+ The ashtray. (a laugh bubbles out of Did you figure out where we're going? . I remember your dad saying the sand was as white as the whites of God's eyes, on the Gulf. I can't see his face anymore. I can't hear his voice. -- But when you come home from fishing -- with the sea and the salt and the engine oil? It's like he's walking through the door. I love that smell -- I can still smell him. She watches the highway posts clack past. I'm hungry. He's worried about the jeweler. (with a grin) What a romantic. He wants to tell her he took the necklace. -- No, 1111 drive. The jeweler happens to glance in their direction. Jason ducks into the car, unnoticed. -- I feel... exhilarated. -- It ain't adrenalin, it's freedom. And she slips her wedding ring off her finger and hurls it overhand as far as she can. It drops into the sea. I don't want one goddamn thing of You're quiet. She doesn't think he's going to answer her. It'll work itself out. People manage. We're here. This is what you always wanted. Sounds like cash. She starts to count it out. Jase! He crumples the paper towel. She holds up the keys for him to see. He's my son. The owner gives her a startled glance. Jason? She sits up in bed. Jason comes in from outside. ... I dreamed I was in jail. You'd come to see me, you were on the other side of the plastic -- like at the bank?. And you were talking, but I couldn't hear you. I put my ear to the holes and I couldn't hear you, but your mouth was moving. And then I realized you couldn't talk anymore. He'd cut your vocal cords, like that dog next door. When you were a kid? her hair a better, brighter color under her chef's hat, is cooking on the grill behind the counter, kidding the customers, enjoying herself. The greasy-aproned OWNER pats her rump as he goes by, not for the first time. Long arms, short dick, they always say. One of the Fishermen guffaws. The owner looks pissed. So does Jason who witnessed it all. About what? I was not-fired, you jerk. I quit. Hey, sailor... She puts on her hat to cut the glare. From under the brim she admires his approach. (as he reaches her) ... Look at you. What's the occasion? Jason squats down beside her and balls up the classifieds. So we're packing. They start walking together. From the water a MAN calls out to Suzanne. ... Too bad. I kinda liked that They'll think you stole it. He looks up at her, caught. She's walking toward the kitchen sink to wash the nursery dirt off her hands. She looks out the window at the boat again. Nice boat. (over her shoulder) Are you allowed just to run around with it? 'His tension ebbs. He picks up his tackle box. -- Don't take advantage, Jason. They trusted you with the job. Hello? She's greedily grateful to hear Alex's voice. -- Hi! I saw on the news there's rain in San Francisco. Are you wet and miserable? Tell me you love me. Who just laughed? I miss you. It's lonely here. There's no return address. She slits it open with her thumbnail. A trickle of sand falls out. I'm looking! Instead, she opens the letter. Here it is. Mr. Raines called from (NAME OF TOWN). He said you-Id know what it was about. Do you,- need the number? What's wrong, what's happened? ... I should have gone through his pockets myself. It didn't occur to me. I was in such a panic. If I'd found the necklace, Jason? I'd have taken it, too. It's okay. I'm the one who hit the bastard. Jason's white face is turned toward them in Suzanne's car. Maybe it's just a tourist cruising around with his head up his butt. Neither of them believes that. ... How about Mexico? The Sea of Cortez? Your father fished for marlin there. The biggest catch he ever had. Anything? You sure? forward. -- Shit! She 'spins the wheel to avoid a head-on, but in so doing she clips the curb and loses control. She throws an arm across Jason to protect him. Jase... Alex checks Jason for her, searching his limp body at the, same time. Don't... (only a breath) ... Fuck you. Jason! (her eyes on his knife) -- Don't hurt me. Please. He went to get you! He's not coming back until tomorrow. She timidly pulls the sheet over her body. Jason yanks it off her so hard it flaps loose from the corners. He touches her belly with the length of his knife, the blade â€¢ flat to her skin. She freezes. It's been here since he went to Napa. They'll lock you up. 'Away from the sky and the air and the sea and the current running against the wind?' That was a very beautiful letter. Jason moves onto the bed, on his knees. beside her. I never mentioned itl Jason's hand curves around her throat,. a, caress, a threat. Not He wasn't interested, he didn't care. He was glad she left. Jason lies down alongside her. W-why? He shrugs; he doesn't trust her. How do you know? She thinks grief has driven him crazy, and he sees that. ... I'm so very sorry about what happened to your mother. His hand skitters away and lights on her ribs. . Don't do this for revenge. (in a whisper) I love you. He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're both naked. They begin to make love. Wait. Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back. This way. She turns on her stomach and guides him back into her. Jason moves now rapidly. Slowly. Her hand on his ass guides the pace. She hasn't had a young man in a long time. What are you doing to me? Don't come, not yet. They move as one, their passion enveloping them. He makes her come first. Then, when her boay flattens, he also comes and he's lying on top of her, his face alongside hers, their breath gentling. Finally, they lie side.by side. Will you get me a towel? With warm water. (after a moment) Are you going to kill me, too? You'll have to. I'll know. I'll be a witness. I'll know you planned it. I like-you too much to let you kill him. Jasonstarts to put on his clothes: I need him, Jason. I'm not going back to Caracas! You don't know how we live there. She pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her nakedness. He touches her shoulder; she shrugs him away. You have to leave now, Jason. This is not your room, though, is it. Jason starts toward the door. Watch me. He closes the door with a solid CLICK. She starts to cry, and still crying, she pulls the sheets off the bed, she has to change the sheets. (too bright and How about a sandwich? He just lost his mother, Alex. You can't expect him to act normal. He steps up beside her and moves her hair off her shoulders. (right back at him) Yes. I gave him sonlething to eat. She walks out and up the stairs to the bedroom. ... I feel like I made her die. Alex sits down beside her and takes her hand. I wanted her to go away so bad... I used to wish she'd die. And then she did. He lets go of her hand. Oh. -I bit my lip. He takes her lip between his and nuzzles it. -- I'm already asleep, honey. Can he hear us? Alex's tone turns. Jason is causing him another problem. He misses his mother. What? Where? No. Alex scoots down next to her, his hand takes possession of her ass. -- Princess Stephanie. He gives a rueful laugh; she's younger than he easily remembers. (with a chuckle) You won't be able to afford it. You'll have spent all your money on my clothes and my jewelry. (slipping her leg I'll wear something like that and then if you lose you can throw it on the table to cover your bet, like James Bond. I looked good in it, didn't I? He pats her shoulder without answering. He won't sleep for a while. Okay. Here I am. What is it? Do you know how much a cab costs? I'm so sick of this. You'd say anything! He hands her the newspaper. reads the headline and starts to laugh. There is such a thing as justicel Dina's necklace. Couldn't happen to a better person. You really hate him. ... The sonofabitch. That's why he went out with me. He was trying to use me! (the thought hits her) They'll think I'm part of it! The maid who got fired?? What difference does it make?? (into the phone) I'm with him. He has a boat, Alex! It's on the boat. The dumb shit wants to turn it over to the cops. You know what'll happen to me. Alex is taking his passport out of his desk. before Jason does) -- Hi, honey. Gabriella comes up onto deck. She glances bewildered at the ocean around them. Why are we -- I don't want either one of you. A line quivers. Jason reels in a little. Help him, Alex. Don't let him have it! He'll kill We were supposed to turn him ini I didn't think you were going to kill him!
