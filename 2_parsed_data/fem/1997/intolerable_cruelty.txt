Tickets, please. Pull in your ears, Rexie -- you're  comin' to a tunnel! Trains... ...I thought he'd outgrown trains. So I see. Hard to believe that's the best he  could do. Oh. Thank you. I'm just enjoying the movie. Rex. Get away from the door. We are. And it's winding down. Are you forgetting about the Atcheson,  Topeka and the Santa Fe? Rex. Go away. I don't want to have  to sic the dogs on you. You want to come out to the beach  house tomorrow? I didn't know Barry had a beach house. Neither did I until my lawyer found  it -- quite a paper trail -- he had  it in the dog's name. So who'd you hire? Ruth Rabino. She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis  or a Pearlman? She definitely did a  Factor. She did a Harriman. Wow. In the words of my Private  Investigator, we're going to nail  his ass. I've been trying to nail George's  for years, but he's very careful.  I'll just keep having children. I  think I'm pregnant, by the way. Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us. Three is not Farrow. Who's Rex's guy? Miles Massey. Of Massey Myerson? Do you know him? By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey  that cute little island of George's. George was so impressed he hired him  when he divorced his second. Muriel Rumsey. Who's she? Now? She's a night manager at  McDonalds. You should have tried to get pregnant  Marylin -- solidify your position. No. You like kids. I can't have a baby with a man I  don't love... And I can't submit a  child to divorce. It's not so bad these days. Kids  like joint custody. Two sets of toys. Maybe next time. Maybe. We do have a man for you. Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just  separated from his third. He's in  fish. He is fish. She's keeping his name. And one of  his planes. And all seven of his  children And only two are hers. Please. I'm not seeing anyone until  this is over. One husband at a time. I wish I had your discipline. No, he had the videos... He would invite these girls home  from the staple factory to our  condominium in Palm Springs. He had  a device he called the Intruder. Well, yes, Morris is my accountant. And you must be Mr. Massey. Hello, Rex. Are you alright? You lost weight. Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly  fishing. He's in a yert in Montana. I ran into your mother at the  radiologist last week. Oh, just a routine mammogram. She  said to say hello. She's going to  Positano with your brother's family. Positano is beautiful. Remember when  we were there, Rex? We stayed in the  Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff? So, Miles. If you have a proposal,  let's hear it. My client has ruled that out. That's delusional. My client feels sufficiently  dispassionate. Ha Ha. My client is prepared to settle for  fifty percent of the marital assets. Oh brother. Here we go. Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe  we're being too conservative. Seventy  five percent. Do you need a Tagamet? These are yours. Have you been taking your digestive  enzymes? I'm sorry. Where were we? We were about to request the primary  residence, and thirty percent of the  remaining assets. Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner  was in Kentucky. The primary residence and FORTY  percent of the remaining assets.  You're becoming tedious Miles. See you at the preliminary. I don't know what his game is. He  dismissed every one of Ruth's  proposals. And Sarah, we weren't  unreasonable. Well what does he want? I don't know. Ruth kept her cool,  but I could tell she was surprised. He has a reputation for being tough. Lilly's up. Oh, God! Every week -- I'm dying. Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by  his intransigence. If I didn't know  better, I'd swear Massey had some  personal investment in my ruination. So where are you now? Well, if he continues to maintain  this position -- we're in court. Shit. Get this! He called and invited me  to dinner. Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure. That's completely odd. I know. That's why I accepted. Find  out what's up with this clown. Ah. No. I have to admit. I was curious. And  hungry. I assume this is on Rex? "Dismiss your vows, your feigned  tears, your flattery, for where a  heart is hard, they make no battery." Did you see the tape? See the tape. Then we can discuss my  heart. Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your  performance about this afternoon? Ruth says you've been too successful,  that you're bored, complacent, and  you're on your way down. How do you know? I told you. I was hungry. I know you do. Risotto with white truffles, please. You didn't ask me here to pick me  up. You could get in trouble for  that. Have you ever been married, Miles? You don't believe in it. You just haven't met the right person. All right, Miles. Let me tell you  everything you THINK you know. I was  married to Rex for a long time. I  was an excellent wife, a partner, a  lover, a hostess and a friend. There  was only one thing I did wrong during  the five years we were together. I  got five years older. Think he should  be able to ditch me for that? See the tape. Then we can discuss  reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I  nailed his ass. Now I'm going to  have it mounted and have my  girlfriends over to throw darts at  it. Then I'm getting on with my life.  That's all I'm after. What is it you're after, Miles? Well, don't look at mine! I was devastated. Of course. Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth. Objection, your honor! Uh... poetry recitation. Your honor, this is harassment! Arid  frankly it's still a little... ...arty farty! Yes. I loved my husband, Rex. "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at  first sight?" Yes. Why is that so difficult for  you to understand? Rex was -- is -- a very appealing  man. I am sorry I couldn't... I tried my best. We rest, Your Honor. Who's that? Jesus. Banderas. Yes, Mr. Bailiff. I do. We don't have much of a relationship  anymore. I haven't seen her since  before she married Rex. We had some  very nice times prior to that. We  were quite close. Is this a lover? Please! Mother? What?! Hi, Sweetie. He'll regret this. No. I haven't. But I've been out of  town. Hello, Rex. Hello there. No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm?  No. Well... no. Objection, Your Honor. This isn't  about Mrs. Rexroth's filial  obligations. Of course. Of course she was married.  What else would she be? Single? I  don't think so. Let me tell you something about Patty. Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like  mine. I was Pat and she was Patty.  But she changed it after seeing "Some  Like It Hot." To Marylin. After  Marylin Monroe. When she was a tiny girl? And people  asked her what she wanted to be when  she grew up? She never said the usual  things little girls say -- like --  nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman?  She always said -- "When I grow up, I want to be  divorced." Well, not just divorce. She used to  say "I want to be divorced from some  big dumb rich guy..." And I guess  her dream is coming true. I'm happy for you Patty It was like that scene in The  Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is  called to testify against the Family.  And he's in court, and he looks into  the spectators gallery, and sees his  Brother. They brought the brother  from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a  word. He can't testify. That's what  it was like seeing Pat in there. I  couldn't even have Ruth cross examine  her. Why do you think she did it? Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA.  Maybe they offered her money. Massey  is very seductive. Who knows. Maybe they put a horse head in her  bed? That stinks. They left you with  absolutely nothing. It makes you  wonder about the entire legal system.  Like Rodney King. They bought her speech. If I was  only in it for Rex's money, he  shouldn't have to give me any. That doesn't make sense. It's like  punishing you for being goal oriented. Well, you can live here as long as  you want. Do you have any plans? Nothing specific, but I'll have my  own place soon. So, Marylin. Is that what you said  when you were a little girl? Probably. Every woman in my life was  divorced at least twice. What was I  supposed to say. Anthropologist? I begged you to have a baby! In the Godfather, after the courtroom  scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his  veins in the bathtub. You're not... No. I'll see some blood before this  is over, but it won't be mine. Well, I wouldn't say -- He -- They hate each other -- Miles, how nice of you to see us --  may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of  Doyle Oil. Miles, I know you're busy and that  you charge by the hour so I'll come  to the point. Howard and I are  planning to marry. Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen  and Mandy must be what -- twelve? Honey, I don't think this is really  relevant to... -- we realized we'd always been very  attracted to one another. Howard! Howard and I are here, Miles, because  I have learned through bitter  experience that when it comes to  matrimonial law, you are the very  best. As you are well aware, my previous  marriage ended with an unjustified  strain on my reputation My motives  were questioned. I was slandered in  court. Therefore in an effort to remove any  trace of suspicion from my sweet  Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement. They say the Massey pre-nup has never  been penetrated. That is true, isn't it Miles? Your  pre-nup is the best there is? Absolutely. We'd better go before we get thrown  out. Getting married. He's passionate. All girls enjoy a little rough trade  from time to time. No. You listen to me. You busted me, Miles. You left me  with nothing! What did you expect me  to do? Get a degree in counseling?  Write a book about table linen?  Because that's what wives do when  they get dumped, and frankly, I'm  not quite ready for that. We told you. We realized we've always  been in love. So I hear. Is that all? I do. Howard is a beautiful person. Miles. Miles. Miles. It was his idea. It was a gesture of  love and trust. Be happy for me,  Miles. Have you tried the duck? It has bones. Be sure to swallow  one. I don't feel victorious Miles. I  feel betrayed, abandoned and  humiliated. I have pictures of him  with another woman... Did you invite me here to score some  cheap laughs. You really think I engineered the  whole thing. You think the marriage  and the divorce was part of some  scheme. You came here to celebrate  because you think I'm without morality  or soul. You -- sound like my mother. Yes, I -- well, I'm not really... Thank you. And good-night. Miles? You're right about me. I am worthless.  I am nothing. I don't deserve to  live. I don't blame them for betraying me.  I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my  father. You see, Miles, I'm going to  tell you something about me. Something  you may or may not know. I suck! Screw you, asswipe! A little. You get out of the car. That's right,  Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you! I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills  hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in  the Polo...? Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and  pick up a blended for -- Okay Miles. I just cried when I got home. Somehow,  your disdain for me -- I'm pretty  tough Miles, but I'm human. All my  life people have been ascribing these  terrible motives to me. I used to  think they were jealous, or they  didn't understand, but... I dunno.  Maybe others see something in me.  Something I'm not even aware of.  Anyway, thank you for letting me  come here. I guess I was a little  drunk. You have a very nice home, Miles.  Very inviting. You have wonderful art. I love that  lithograph. Hockney? From a -- girlfriend. No kidding. I'll bet you have some  very grateful clients. What'd Rex  buy you? Is that you? Oh. And that is -- mom? You look like you were a very  sensitive child. You have expressive  eyes. And your mother was very beautiful.  She must be proud of you. She didn't love you? She held that against you? Boy. Boy, oh boy. And here I thought my mother was... Oh right. You met Patricia. We're damaged goods. We are, Miles. You know I'm right.  There's something "off" about you  and me Miles. And maybe it isn't  because of these women -- maybe they  were just extremely insightful and  recognized our "deficiencies" very  early on. Maybe... I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen  to me. I'm sure you have a very  fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm  depressing. Thank you for the coffee. It's very  robust. Friends? I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not  used to losing control with such --  volume. What is it Miles? Huh? Did you just propose to me? Yes. Yes, Miles. I accept. Do you want me to sleep on it? Do you want to sleep on it? Yes. Again. I know. I'm happy. Dr. Beck! You're Dr. Beck? I have an appointment  to see you in March. Right after I  lose the babyweight. Which of course,  will be after I have the baby... Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona --  this is Miles Massey. Hello Miles. Congratulations Miles. I do. He was at my divorce and my  wedding. What would a marital related  event be without Wrigley? I loved the berry spoons. I didn't have any. Thank you. It is. It's famous. Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce  hearing? Excuse me, Judge Muson. You brought a pre-nup to our wedding? Miles. I don't want to sign this. I  want this marriage to be different.  Okay. Judge Munsen and Wrigley are  here, but other than that... Oh Miles! Miles. Listen to me. You are about  to become my husband. I don't want  to be protected from you. I want to  be protected for you. I want this to be a marriage based  on love, trust and community property.  That's all I've ever wanted. But Marylin, without this, you're  completely exposed. I want to be exposed. You're vulnerable. It's about time. Quack. Yes. I do. I have Mrs. Massey on line one for  you. I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll  move to the... Honey, I could sit... Hardly. You have six bedrooms Well, I suppose I could "girly" it  up for you with a little Fortuny,  and some passementerie -- Fabric and fringe. Miles. You said 'yes' didn't you? I said yes. Is this Ming? It's not Ming. It's Tong. Is Tong older than Ming? I think Ming is older than Tong. What is this? Ok. I'll take it. I can't do this anymore. Let's get  some lunch. What about rugs? I thought we were  stopping at Mansour? Right. Well. He said to "make the house  mine." Oh boy. If he only knew. Yeah. I guess. You know -- What? He's not what I expected. He's very --  he's so -- happy. But you're going through with it? Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've  never been the first wife. Rex was  married before me. So what? Miles is different. He's still so  idealistic. Well, that's about to change big  time. He has no cynicism or anger. For  once I'm not the repository of rage  at some other woman. Soon, you'll have your own rage! I guess. Wait. I know you. You're Miles Massey! You probably  don't recognize me. The drugs made  me put on weight and grow facial  hair. You ruined my life you sonofabitch.  Gimme those. But my brother got you. He got you,  you slimeball. Emily! Howard Doyle is my brother? You know  my brother, Howard Doyle. You do  know my brother, don't you? I'm sorry, Sir. Emily. Give the man  back. He tricked you. With a phony wife  and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He  got you. You married Marylin, didn't  you? You thought she had money. HA  HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think  that because of what you did to me.  And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard  all about it. My brother Howard Doyle  got you. Neener neener neener. Marylin was friends with Howard and  Amanda Doyle. They don't like the  way you operate. They helped her. I have no idea what Howard Doyle  eats. I'm not a damn dietician. She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask  her? Anyway, I assume she signed the  highly over rated Massey pre-nup. ...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  our stars... And it's good! Don't threaten me, Miles. I did  nothing illegal. That's attorney client privilege. Sorry, Miles. But as a great and  clever man once said, What's good  for the goose -- Hi. I have a surprise for you. Ta Da. You don't like it? You don't like me? What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too  much? Miles. I have a very good relationship  with all the salesmen. I can return  everything. Miles? You're scaring me. But Ruth -- things have changed --  yes -- yes I understand. But you see --  I couldn't file, did I? And maybe I  wasn't going to file. Maybe -- maybe  Ruth -- Yes. Okay. Miles? Open the door, Miles. Please  open the door. I want to talk to  you. Miles? I'm coming in. Here I  come. Vishu! Knock it off. That hurts. I don't even know where he is. He  looked so devastated. If I could  just talk to him for a few minutes. Was that the bell? It sounded like a bell. I'll be right back. Yes? Can I help you? Yes. What? Forgery and Fraud? You used his credit card. He told me to -- he said he wanted  me to -- Quite a little shopping spree. How  do you spend six figures in less  than six hours? Oh, never mind I've  seen it before. I've seen everything. Do you think he set me up? Do you  think that was his intention? Like I know his intention? Or yours  for that matter? I should join Sam. I'm too old for  this bullshit. He never even asked. He just assumed -- He was right, wasn't he? So. Now what? Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a  deal or find out how Jean Harris  made it work for her. May I come in? I'd just like to pick up a few of my  things On the contrary. We're married and  we have no pre-nup, so a case could  be made that everything in here is  mine. Comfy! I want to nail you ass. I'm reporting you to the IRS. I'm not talking about dollars,  studmuffin. I'm talking about -- STUFF. Arty Farty stuff. Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans.  Watches and mileage on private jets.  Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from  grateful clients. Salary. Unreported income. By the way, what time IS it on  Bellagio Road? I don't have to. That's what the IRS  guys do. And they do it with great  zeal. See, they work at these tortuous  civil service jobs, and when five  hundred dollar an hour boys like you  take their trade out in luxury  goodies, these saps feel.. well,  they feel like saps. And they feel  bitter and they feel vengeful and  they feel WRATH. What is this? A Romeo and Julieta? I know. So am I, right? And so is  Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue  Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid  graduate of Southwestern University --  very tenacious, and never more so  than when he's dealing with an  unscrupulous colleague. I think it's only fair to warn you:  I'm going to file an action, Miles.  And after a decent interval I plan  to have Ruth seek an injunction that  will forbid your approach within 500  feet of my house. I believe the residence will be part  of the settlement. Drop the bogus forgery charge and  I'll forget about your generous  friends slash clients. That's marriage. You'll always be my favorite husband. We are interrupting our scheduled  weekend coverage because we have  just received word there is a verdict  in the Kentucky v Leonard Case. We  now join the case -- live. He got away with it. Hello? Miles? Miles! Where have you been?  I've been trying to get in touch. I will, Miles. I will leave. But  Miles -- Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles.  It's true that my initial intention  was to... I fell in love Miles. You do? You do love me? Whoever sent you, I'll pay double. Is this Mr. Dumbarton? Triple! It's a no go, Joe. It's okay Joe. Now. But first, he worked for you. Wait just a second there. You sent  him here. You unearthed this  pestilence. I'm sorry. That was unkind and --  but, we changed our minds. Did you really mean what you said on  the phone. It wasn't because you  found out about Rex? That's true. Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay  you the twenty thousand. Well, actually, all whores worship  the dollar, if you want to get  technical. I'm not leaving you. I took self  defense Alright. Hello Miles. It's not something I wanted either. Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt  when I realized you'd hired the goon  to kill... Now you both wait a minute. Nobody  hired anyone to kill anyone. We've outlined a settlement... We think it's more than generous. How could I trust you, after... after  all of this. Your forgetting Rex Rexroth? Forgery? Fraud? Murder? I don't see how we can ever find our  way back from... It's the Massey pre-nup -- O-kay. I'm going back to the office Come on Wrigley, I'll buy you a drink  and an anti depressant. Not if you're lucky. No. You know, sweets, he's right. Fine. They were created during a  dictatorship. What if something happened to you?  What would I tell little Gus when he  asked "what was my daddy like?" Sweet.
