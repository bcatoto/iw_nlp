All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town. No. I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league. This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh? Has anybody offered to buy it? About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately? Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question. Who? Who? Always has been. Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral. Are you alright, Wade? Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?I want to go home. Oh. You're a policeman. That's illegal, you know. I want to go home. What are you sorry for? Okay. Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want? Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says -- Nothing. No. Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you. Oh. Pop? It's pretty old. Are we going in this? Dad. That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here. Yes. Yes. Yes. I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me. See, I knew you'd be mad. I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me. Yes. I called Mommy. I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home. No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home. No. I want to go home. I don't like it here. It's stupid. It's not that. I don't want to. No. She doesn't talk about you anymore. I just think you used to be bad. I bet you did lots of bad things. But it's not funny now. Was it funny? Did you do that when you were a kid? Yeah. It's stupid. You know. Why do they do that? I don't care. They're out. Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out. Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it. You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low. See. Get your boots. Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford? Let the past be. I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone. We've done all our talking, Wade. No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far. Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse. She's grown up some, hasn't she? While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname? Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends? Where's Jill?Don't be silly. Hi, Jill. I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat. I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you? What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way? What happened? Wade. How? Think they're alright? Are you sure they're home? Did you call? I know your parents. Did you tell them? That we were coming? Alright. I'll think about it. You've been married twice -- Oh, Wade. Then... I guess you have to. Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now? It's nice. What way? You knew me as a kid. But not now. You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money. The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt? Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him? Jack doesn't need money. Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose? ...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else. I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her... Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks. Okay. Call me. No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you. You don't mean that. I'm sorry. About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian? I'm sorry about what I said. You okay? You okay? Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break. You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off. How's she doing? New hat? Jill's up, I see. Can --? When did she die? Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that? You're not using it today? Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now! Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too. You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something? Hold on! Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts? What the hell are you talking about? I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.' Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.Can't it wait, then? Something about my father? Mrs. Gordon. Thank you. He's asleep. We were up very late. Who are you?
