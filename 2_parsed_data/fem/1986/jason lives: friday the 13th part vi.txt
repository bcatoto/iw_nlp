That's it. Pull over. I'm drivin'. Will you hurry up! I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it. Go out and plug the cord back in. My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence. If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt. Great. Just great.I could swear I heard... Of course not. If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost. Come on, you guys! The game's over!! See any paint?... ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando. Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine. ....with a woman's touch.Stay cool? You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it. That's it. We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse. That's a freakin' fact. Least of all us. We're gonna scare him?! Why? Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly. Darren, we better turn around. I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer. Well, who told me to take this cow path?No. No, it's not... Daddy, what is going on? Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right? All he's asking is for you to check it out. I thought Jason was only a legend? What it is? How do you know? Did you take his temperature? When are you going to stop treating me like one! But, Dad, we... Jason who? Come on, Dad. You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them. Did you hear me?! They did show up. Isn't that great? Lake Forest Green? Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away? Wait a minute. I just... Okay, give it back. Why? There...Ya happy? What's it to ya? It's all over. You got it. Just keep an eye out for roadblocks. Then let's get goin'. We can argue on the way. You tell me what you need... ...I'll make sure you get in. Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this? Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here. Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now. Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible. If he finds you, he'll...But what I get scared again? But what if they try and scare us? Who ya calling? Huh? Are they grown-ups? Why? I found it outside. No more. Nancy. No, he was real. Like on TV. There was this monster. He was after me. He wanted to kill me.Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared? I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins. So you just go back to sleep and don't worry. We'll scare 'em right back. I can't believe no one called back. I better... That's debatable. Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared. You know what? Sissy and Cort are playing jokes. You know, trying to scare each other. Where'd you get this? ...Good. So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh? Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember? This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?... Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie? You mean you had a bad dream. So what happened? What's goin' on? He didn't say anything? I just realized something. Where's Cort? I haven't seen him for hours. Hi. Everything's all right now. We're here. No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit? Huh? Oh, come on, Sis. I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people. You gotta be kidding! Which is? So where's Cort gone off to? It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.I think somebody's messin' around out there. Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night." I don't know. He called somebody, then took off. Yeah, we're here. Of course not. She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it. I still don't get it. Why him? I mean, he's cute alright, but... Why not? I used to play it alone. I love murder games. Have you ever played The Consulting Detective? Okay, okay. I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife. Boy scouting. Are you ready? He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport. All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
