Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by. Okay honey. I've seen a few. Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house. I'm not sick. Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you? I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness. You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?Hold me. I'M FALLING! HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him! Hold me, Don. Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!! They hurt his head. My secret lover. Where have you been? Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God. Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God. No. Hi baby. I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that. Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat? I want you to stay with me. Why are you here? HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK. I did. Are you? If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold. There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death. Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again. It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you? You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease. Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease. I love you Don with all my heart. Just get outta my bed. And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then! I asked first. Do you love me? Kiss me. What if Frank came over here and found us? Beeeee careful. Does that scare you? Frank would open you. What if I told Frank that you opened me? You like to open me, don't you? No police!!! No police!! I want you to hurt me. Do you want to do bad things? Anything, anything. Are you a bad boy? What do you want to do? Do you like my body? I'm not crazy. I know the difference between right and wrong. No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay. Don't hate me. Yes. Frank-- It used to make me laugh, but. Come in. Please, please stay. Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now. Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh? Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me? Don? Are you in with them? Falling. Look. I can't. I can't. You think you know so much. Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die. Who's it, you mean. I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet. Oh shit. I liked being with you last night. I looked for you in my closet tonight. It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you. Why are you here. Whatiya want? Yeah, hurry up though. It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now. Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I? Sometimes I think it would be fun. Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret. I want to die. Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you. Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you. You don't? Do you know? I made it go down the toilet. You can be my special friend and come and put that in me. Do you like me? You can hit me, if you want to. You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard. See my nipples? See my breasts? See? Do you like the way I feel? Thank you. honey. Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please. Don? Sure I'm alright. Don't. I don't like that. What do you want? Lie down on the bed. Do you like talk like that? Do you like that? What do you want? What do you want from me? No way. NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you. How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you. Get undressed. I want to see you. How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress? THEN WHAT? That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what? The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word. Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME. An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before. Shit. You better tell me something. What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here? You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont? Jeffrey. Jeffrey what? GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? Yeah. Oh yeah, that's good. Oh God, that stuff stinks. Yes? What is it? No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said. Oh he forced you, huh? 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight. Alright, suit yourself. Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back. Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it. If you want to. Those are my breasts. Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please. Yes, but. Frank? Where are we going, Frank? He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking. Mommy's here. Hello, daddy. Hello, baby.You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late. Is something wrong? What's happened to your face? Of course, Jeffrey. Alright. Do you want the car? Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so. It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him. He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you. Jeffrey, when you see your father. I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning. Jeffrey, breakfast is ready. Where's all your things, Jeffrey? Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store. I mean, for good, Jeffrey.I'll get a coat for her. Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon. Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes. Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute. Here you are. Would anyone like coffee? Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey. He comes over to study. It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good. Would you like a piece of cake? I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame. Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee? Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?Look Jeffrey. No Jeffrey!! Go ahead! Go ahead. Jeffrey? What's going on? Right. Watch out for Mike, there. Probably not. No. Why? Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her? Dorothy Vallens? No. Oh my God. What's wrong? Okay. Just a minute. NO. Really? You want to dance? Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening? It's okay. Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned? It's good to see you. What was that all about? What is it? I should never had gotten you going on this. Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on! You didn't tell him about me? Everything okay? Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it. Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this. You like mysteries that much? Jeffrey? Why? I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment? Jeffrey!! Oh yeah? Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other. Shoot. You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals. Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later. What am I going to do? You were late. Goodnight. You better not, Jeffrey. Okay, be careful. No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey. So are you. I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back. I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you. In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble. You're sure right. It is a strange world. Who, me? Why should it? Yeah? Did you see her undressed? Twice. Without her sensing anything? You saw a lot in one night. Wow. Should you tell my father? You want to tell me about it? You want a Dairy Queen? It's okay. Don't worry about it. He got a little jealous. What did you see? Well, how did it go? What happened? Okay, okay. Bye. I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert. I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay? I'm going to wait here until she comes. Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep? Okay, yeah, call. I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over. I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee. OK. Yeah, but. It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you. Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it. I'll drink to that. That sounds good. This is not my usual Friday night! Brilliant. What's the plan. Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock. I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7. I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do? You really want to do this, don't you? Yes. I do. I owe you, since I goofed up this one. So, what's next? Yeah, if it opens the door. No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall. I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright? Are you alright? Alright. Good luck, yourself. Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy. Alright. You've got a point there. I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous. What will I say when she comes to the door? Now, how are you going to do that? It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess. You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps. Alright, now tell me. What is it? Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart. I'm here, aren't I? Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute. I don't know. I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world. I've gotta go in. What happened to him? Still, it must be kinda rough. Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home? My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered. I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case. I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you. That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching. Not really, why? You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you. Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her. Maybe so. No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts. There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others. I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names. Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? That's too bad. Yeah. What are you doing now? Terrible boring. Yes. Am I bothering you? You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office? I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central. Stop it Mike. Okay. Sure, just a sec. Excuse me. Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on. You can change it if you want to. Mike's gotta go. Nice to meet you.
