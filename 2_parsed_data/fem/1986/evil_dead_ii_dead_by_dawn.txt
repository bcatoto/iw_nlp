Ash, what's that you're playing? Ow! I really love it.  I'll never take it off. Hi. Terrific.  I found the additional pages from the Book of the Dead. Maybe longer. Tonight.  Is everything all set with my father? Maybe nothing.  But just possibly... the doorway to another world? DANCE WITH ME! Please Ash, help me.  I love you, please don't hurt me. You promised me we'd always be together.  You swore to me! Excuse me.  This the road to the Knowby's cabin? And why not? What happened? There must be another way in. Another road or something. None of your business. How much? Tell you what.  You take my bags you got a deal. Oh my God.  Where are my parents? What the hell did you do to them? These are my father's things. No. No.  Can't be. Let him out. LET HIM OUT! Come to me.  Come to sweet Henrietta. Yesssssss.  You and I.  We shall spend eternity together. For God's sake!  That's my mother! Remember that song Annie?  I used to sing it to you when you were a baby. Let me out, dear.  It's so cold and dark in here. Mother? Unlock these chains.  Quickly. No.  No.  I don't know what you are but you're not my mother. No! That thing in the cellar is not my mother! Dead by dawn!  Dead by dawn! Free me!  Unlock these chains! No. NO! It's so quiet. I'll go with you. What is it? In 1300 AD.  This was the "Hero from the Sky," who was prophesized to destroy this Evil. Here it is.  Two passages. We've got it! Recitation of the first passage will make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself in the flesh. Recitation of the second passage creates a kind of rift in time and space, and the physical manifestation of this spirit can be forced back through this rift... to an earlier time and place.  At least that's the best translation I can .... No! I'll never take it off. Okay. Are you sure? Yeah, but for how long? If we're going to beat this thing, we need those pages. Did you find her? Nos-feratos-allo-memnon-kanda! Free!  Free at last! I'll swallow your soul, swallow your soul! Swallow your soul! No!  I only completed the There's still the second passage. The one to open the rift and send the evil back. Tar-tra Kanda-Estra!  Hudsucker Proxy -- Kanda! Aton-Neran-Ofas! Kanda!  Samonda Roba Areda Gyes Indy En-zeen, Nos-Feratos - Nos-feratos - Amen-non.
