I don't recommend it. If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself. What are you planning, Jack? No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box. When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?' That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown. I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in... Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked. So do I. What do you want? He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall. But I don't think he's psychic. What he has it empathy and projection. He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him. I wouldn't presume to try. It was you who did the asking. Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now. What about him? How are Molly and the boy? The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them. I don't have an answer for you. Listen to me, my friend: leave this. He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead. I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds. Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back. No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'... You wouldn't like it, either if you had it. He thinks you want him to look at evidence. You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone? Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you? Let's forget who said what to whom... Maybe we should give it some time... That's not true. Will? You could come up here. I came up here after Kevin's father died. They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too. It's what Kevin called her when he was little... Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days... Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and... I want to see you, too. Will? Are you okay? I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me? Will... William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed. Is Crawford going with you? What will you do? And... where are things? Can you quit? Then why? Have you ever omitted telling me. things before? I'd like one of your cigarettes, please. Can I have one of your cigarettes? Do you remember what you said? You remember when we first met? And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong? He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face. You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us. And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay... He's after you now, isn't he? I love you... Blue is cold. Yellow's a bad color for me. I'll look green at breakfast. I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there? To do what? Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered. Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing. Which part? That or the day-to-day. Me, too. And very erotic... At the store. You doin' some good? Hello, hotshot! Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night. Huh? Will? Is that you? Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me. And Kevin. That's selfish, huh? What you've already decided. You're not really asking. All the things that happened to you before make you know that... You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma. You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that... I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone. He asked how you are. He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon. The Tooth... Am I alone in this room? Are you here... Why are you doing this?! Francis...? Who? Who is it? You'll come by? Are you okay...? I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over? Francis? Where are you? I'm fine, Francis. I'll get my purse. My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too? Good morning... If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee... I'm fine. Is that you. D? That was nice of you to think of that. Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is? I'll probably go back to it someday. You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children... They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract. In the kitchen. Come on in. How about a gin and tonic? Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time. No, thanks. I manage very well. I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow. The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code. It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do? Let me stick this in the black hole. When do you need it? What's being photographed? Can you give me an idea of the conditions... Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.They got shot a Telex. They're on if now... Not yet. He went to the men's room. He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
