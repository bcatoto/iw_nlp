I love that. That's my type. He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane? Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil. ...because there are no interesting single men at this party! Oh, good... ...any sister talk? Great. Yeah. Uh -- A lot of works. That's just -- Great. Oh, yeah. What are your favorite buildings, David? Oh-- Yeah. Wha-- What kind of things do you build? Oh. Well, let's hope so. Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's. I do the, uh, crï¿½pes caviar. We need more bread and some baked lasa-- uh, lasagne. Hi. Look, it's just an evening at the opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting? I know. I said that, but... he said it was something he really felt like doing. Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it. He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me. He wants to take me to see Rigoletto. No, he called late last night. Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. I didn't know what to say. Oh, uh, listen, David called me up. Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week. I'm real low on money. Well, sometimes, some, uh... If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah? Well, wait. You know what? I know. Uh... Well, I live downtown. Oh, geez, yeah. Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though. ...a monstrosity! Who would do that? It feels like you're in France. It's French, though. It really is. It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean. I-I... I can't put it into words. The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes. Oh, is that what it is? Oh, it's magnificent! Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba. That, I wasn't such a big hit. Mmm. No, really, I really like him a lot. I mean, I've looked everywhere.Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home. I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine. Do you remember that summer in France? Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks. Right. Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny. But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm. Oh, that was a wonderful show. I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something. Or go to a whorehouse! No? Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap. I know, I know, and your hamster. Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us. No. Yes, please. Yeah. What? You're just realizing this now? Yeah...but you're not dying! Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating. Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious... It was on your shirt! Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma. But you don't have any symptoms! I don't know. Cancer, I-- Well, he has to rule out certain things. But there's nothing wrong with you. Mickey, come on, we got a show to do! But not you. You don't have a brain tumor. He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY No, naturally they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em. Hello? Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes. Yeah? In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number? Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.I can't believe it! Mmm? Oh, listen... Come in, come in. Mm-mm! It's so pitch-black tonight. I feel lost. You matter to me. Completely. Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do you, do you, do you phone them? Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back? Do you? You must. They- they seem to know so much about us. Well, what is it then? What? Eh, what's come between us? How have I alienated you? I'm not accusing. I'm asking. Do you...do you find me too...too giving? Too-too-too competent? Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something? Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us? About our-our personal life? What, you, of c-- What are you talking about? Of course not. I'd be destroyed! Are you? Well, what? What, wh-what are you not telling me? Are you in love with someone else? Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage? Are you angry with me? Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that. When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos. But what do, what do you-- what's that mean? W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get? I want one with you. Well, tell me. Should I be worried? Why do you say that? Is there something wrong? Why not? Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat. Yes. I know. The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself. And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me. Are you in a bad mood? It's so late. Where're you going? Holly and April, thanks for helping. Mmm. God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him? I know. Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these. She has all the cooking talent. I know! I know! Aren't they great? Have you tried these? These are wonderful. Holly and her friend made them. Oh, Mom! It's on the table, Dad. Hi, Mom. How you doing? Here, let me get you some coffee. That's enough of that. What triggered it? Don't make it worse, Dad. Hi. How's she doing? ...just for a second. So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest. I don't know about that. Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky. W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage... I am... I did slave all day. Get his wine away. I know, she...she really writes good dialogue. Yeah? What's the matter? What's the matter with you? You look pale. You okay? Oh, now-- What do--? You're being ridiculous. I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but... I've been trying to talk to him about it. He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions. Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just...kind of distant and difficult. Oh, he's fine. He's-he's, I guess he's fine. I don't know. He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months. Y-yeah. I'm okay. I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know-- Do you miss Frederick? So how are you? ...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive. I hope you tell her it was your idea... Oh, yeah? How's she doing? Hi. Where's Holly? Oh, yeah? Doesn't she look pretty? You look so beautiful. Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere. You've outdone yourself. Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs? Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor. I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that. W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination. Just think about it. That's all I ask. I want to experience childbirth. Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen. You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor. Well, what about artificial insemination? I don't know. Excessive masturbation? Could you have ruined yourself somehow? This is the second opinion. Is there no chance? Wow! Football! Oh! That's a beauty! Thanks, thanks. You know, he's been wanting a mitt. That's really nice! I know, I know. Ohh! Yeah. I think so. I think he'll find that satisfying. Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play. He's fine. Here, you guys. Open them up. Everything's good. Everything's fine. Huh? Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you. Very good. Glad you could put in an appearance. Hi! Hi! True. Now, Holly's not shy. I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know? I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things. Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes. He's all show! Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?! Okay, okay. Okay, stop being so dramatic. You promised to stay on the wagon. Here, Mom. Drink this. You know, you're awful. You probably were flirting. ...from Mavis, also. I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you. I don't...I don't want to bother everyone. Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things? How? They're private! You're grateful, but you resent me. You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something. You think I'm too self-sufficient? Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people? Do I, do I put people off? No, not "Oh, so loosely"! Real specifically! Is that how you see us? It's obviously based on Elliot and me. I'm real upset about what you wrote. Take...take a year. Take six months. Whatever you want. Who knows? Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play. Write! Let's just not talk about it anymore. Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write. You're crazy! That's not true. You're too demanding. I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially. I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men. There's nothing I would-- Not so! No. I think I've been very supportive. I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice. How? I'm not! I'm not! I'm trying to be helpful. A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress. Now I'm a writer." I mean-- No. She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department. That-that can lead to other things. Well, I don't know. We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting? Well, that-that's good. It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively... Well, that...th-that's fine. Oh, God... Oh, gosh. Oh, what do they know? Boy-- Awwww... Hey, hi! Look, everything's going your way. What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything? I hope. ...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something? No, I didn't, I, that's no. No, I- I-I, no, I-I just... hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know. You know, you know how you take... Uh-huh. No, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean that. No, I didn't mean that. I know, no-- I know. Ohh! No! No, I, eh, it's just that they sing. Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung. Really? Singing? You found all this, all this out on one date? Oh? Oooo. Oh-oh. HOLLY ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions. She's schizophrenic. Well, I, I really like that. I think that's a pretty color on you. Oh! Here. Be careful with those. He's the headmaster of Daisy's school. He's not a loser at all! It's, uh, you never know-- Watch out, you guys. Beep-beep! When does Frederick ever come with her? Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around. Don't you think she does? Doesn't she look great in that new dress? Ohh? Are we talking about cocaine again? Will you just tell me one thing? Yeah. Uh-huh. I know. H-how much do you need? Holly, please. Don't insult me. Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm? Oh, sure. Perfect! What? You're kidding!Gee, um... I...I don't know what to say. But I'm seeing him. And you, you-you're going? I, uh, I'm very surprised. You're joking. What? Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health. I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised. I mean, it's jammed. If we went... um... Uh... It depends on what way you want to go. Yeah, I, we both live downtown. Okay. Yeah. It's really terrible. That's disgusting! Yeah. Right. Uh-- APRIL I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know. Oh! Wow, it's the red one? We're a big hit. Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane. No, really, we mustn't get discouraged. I know. It's terrible! Oh, okay. Yes. Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it? Oh, gee, I don't know. Um... Fast. Yeah. And it ruins everything else. Yeah. ...and open the French doors and go on the balcony -- Oh, it's just so romantic. I just want to put on a long gown... Uh-huh. It's terrific! Yeah. Oh, what, what do you do? We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried... What makes you think we're more interesting? Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company. Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams. Really? Is the food that bad? We're actresses. Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs? Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em? No, he hasn't. If I offended you, I'm sorry. That's the point. I'd like to be bothered. Well, why don't you share them with us? Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems. Oh, wow! I don't want to have this conversation. I didn't do anything wrong. Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know. Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism. We love you. We're grateful." Wow, I guess I hit a nerve. Well-- Oh, so loosely. My script? Hey, what's the matter? Good. What's the matter? What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden? Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre. You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with! Uh, losers! All losers! Hmm! You never have any faith in my plans. You always undercut my enthusiasm. You treat me like a loser. Yeah, you mean not at my age. Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging. Yeah, that's clerical. Well-well, like what? But what I decided to do is some writing. Yeah, I think I've had it with acting. You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls. And I can't handle another rejection. Now let's face it here. I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life. You know--something with a future. I'm not sixteen anymore. It's just...crazy! I've got...an idea for a story. More than one. And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even. Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And... you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. You got it. They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means. So what's new? Well, I just came from an audition... Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why. Tch, well, I sing! For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing! Boy, you really know how to cut me down. Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it. Yeah. W-why? You don't think it's realistic? Easily. Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song. I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I-- You know. Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well? Well, I mean, why not? You know, wh-what have I got to lose? Uh... Yeah, can you believe it? I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical. Of course, I'll never get it. Well, I think he was dying to open up. It's so sad. Now...what should I wear to my audition? ...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so... ...and then she just breaks down. And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently. I mean... Sometimes she's terrific... He's married... Oh, yeah. Well, how about this? You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed. You know what I'm saying? HANNAH Oh, no, not at all. Ouch! Maybe at Christmas, New Year's. If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's. Not this Thanksgiving, you know. Oh, perfect! He reminds me of Ichabod Crane. His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH Listen. He's a lot better than your ex-husband. He's got a good job. Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything. Oh, he's such a loser! He's such a loser! Oh, Hannah! Oh, your kids are so adorable. Tch. He's such an angry...he's such a depressive. I thought she was moving out! Frederick didn't come with her. I should get a garter belt. She really does, though. Yeah. Uh-oh. I swear. I swear. We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties. Okay. Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy... and some old debts I have outstanding. You admit that we're great cooks, right? Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great. Two thousand dollars. Someday, I'll pay it all back. This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts. Hannah, I have to borrow some more money. Don't get upset. Get outta here. Could I speak to you privately? Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties. No, no, we decided! I'm pregnant. Mickey? Tch. Thanks. Just a few minutes ago. Okay. Hi. Yeah. Sure. Sure, uh, yes. It's all right. That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself. Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and that's this. Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that? H-how did you get over it? I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine. Well, you seem fine now. Y-you used to-- Oh, no! Yeah, I care. You used to be so ambitious and... God, you really liked it?! Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life. Uh, gee. Would you like to have lunch? Uh, uh... Oh, wow! Oh, God! Oh! Right. Oh, gosh, you really think I can write? Oh, it just came to me one day. Really? No, you can tell me straight. It's okay. Just, you know, tell me what you think. Oh, well. Hmm. I think it's lucky I ran into you. Maybe. Oh, gosh, I don't know. Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you? So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one. Oh, no! It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know. I don't know. ...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I-- Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh... But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script. Well, it's not my first script. Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion. Oh, I'm fine. You're okay, though, huh? Oh. Oh. You're kidding me. I haven't. No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so-- No, I haven't. No, the reason I ask is-- Really? Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right? Come on. Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this. Yeah. No, well...I've been trying to write. Probably not. ...just some stuff. A little of this, a little of that, that's all. Oh, nothing much. You know... I'm okay. Yeah, and for yours. I'm sure you've changed. Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired... People change...you know. Oh, well, that was a long time ago. I'd never do that. Yeah, it was. Yeah? Oh, no. I'm fine. How are you? We didn't hit it off. Yeah. I recall you. I remember you. God! You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately. Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out. This crowd wouldn't know the difference! They're embalmed! At least I'm open to new concepts! I was so bored! Thanks for a swell time. Eh, Mickey, it's getting late. Do you mind? I'm-I'm my own person. Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you! I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you. Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music. I don't know where you went, went wrong. I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you? No! Come on, Mickey. Come on. You want some? Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy! The room's alive with positive vibrations! Listen, you are witnessing genius! Oh, why are you making those faces? Why are you so upset? I just want a salad. You really think I'm a loser, don't you? Yeah, okay, right. Forget it. What's to eat? Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe. Thanks. But guess who was there auditioning? ...which I did not get. Dad! Dad... Get a garter belt... Get a garter belt and flirt. God. Mm-hm. Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning. Oh, my God. Thank you.Yeah. Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big. Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love. Uh-huh. Yeah? Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah. Hi, Dusty. Ah, it's over! Elliot, I mean it. It's over! I care a great deal about him, yes. Yeah. Uh, well, sure we did. An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah. Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in. I was very weak. So were you. Now I've met someone else. It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know. I've got to be honest with you. I met someone else. I've met someone else. I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever. Look, I'm just as much at fault. It's over, Elliot. I don't know how to make it any clearer. It's over. I can't see you anymore. Oh, not here. There are too many people around. No. I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me. I know she must be a really passionate person. Oh, all the time. I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah. That was just perfect. You've ruined me for anyone else. I know it isn't. I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone. I was so torn when you called. I didn't sleep all night. I almost didn't. Oh, please, I have to go. I have to get my teeth cleaned. Oh, Elliot, please! I can't be a party to this! I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street! Look, don't do anything on my behalf. I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close. Yes! But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right? I can't say anything! Poor Hannah. But not over me? Why? Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah. I jus-- Not because of me, I hope. Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close. She'd tell me such a thing. What do you expect me to say? Why, you know the situation. Oh, don't say those words! Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing? I was looking for you. Elliot! What are you doing?! Elliot! Don't! Did you ever read this one--? Yes, it made me cry it was so beautiful...so romantic. They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS. Yes, he's just adorable. Isn't that beautiful? Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera. An architect. Yeah. Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended... Oh. Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you. I have to get my teeth cleaned this week. Oh, yeah. Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend. Bye. Well, yeah, yeah. You'd love it. It's really entertaining. You'd have a good time. I know you would. Well, thanks a lot. Well, sure. Uh, uh, this is great. I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this. No, I don't think so. Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much. Fine. Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met. It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick. I mean...you learn so much. Do you like Caravaggio? I'm...all right. Everything's okay? Yes? No? You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay? No, I don't have time. Well, you sure picked the right place. I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read. What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT What? Book? Isn't this great? They have everything here. Yeah, sure. Yeah, you would. Don't let me get started on my childhood. Oh, you know what? There is a bookstore. Oh, God. Yeah, unhappy and fat. And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know. Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick. I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on. Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you still go to those? You never tough alcohol. Yes, I do. Oh. Well, I live-- Ohhhh! You're out looking here? Oh, what, in this section of town? What are you doing here? Oh, Elliot! ...ex-husband on the street the other day. I don't know exactly. Oh, I don't know. My unemployment checks are running out. Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings. Oh, well, you know Frederick. One of his moods. Although it wasn't a bad week. He uh, sold a picture. Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me. The Easter Parade? You were right. It had very special meaning for me. Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway? I mean... it's not sexual anymore. It's certainly not intellectual. I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that-- Oh, God, I don't even know what I want. Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me. It's not fair! I want a less complicated life, Frederick. I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late. It doesn't make a difference! I have to move out! What's the difference?! It's just somebody I met! But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later. I can't live like this! Yeah. I'm saying it now! I'm sorry. Stop accusing me! No. No. Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try. I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while. Because I have to! Yes, we're going to have this conversation again. I...I have to leave. I have to move out. Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating! I'm not your pupil. I was, but I'm not. I can't take this anymore. Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten. What's the problem? Oh, Frederick! Big. Frederick, show him the oils. Oh, no, no, no. He's my sister's husband. And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent. Based on what? You never even see him. Me? Mmm you never know. They might. He's just trying to do the nice thing. Mm-hm. ...you're such a puzzle. So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. Mmm... You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet. God! And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time. I really think you would have enjoyed yourself. Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? Are you sure? How about something to eat? Want some coffee or tea? Yeah. I'll get some ice. Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote? It was great. She's really developed. I think we need to eat. I'm-I'm okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden. I'm-I'm...I have a headache. She's going through a really rough time right now. Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?! You are, Holly. Stop it. Oh, no! I mean, everyone thinks things like that. Like what? Oh... Really? You know, how's everything? You doing okay? How's Frederick? I mean, Elliot. How are you? No. Oh, me, I'm okay. Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all. Why? Hi. She's auditioning for a television commercial. She said she's gonna be a little late. He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. I bumped into your... Come on. Oh, great. Okay. I think they're fantastic. You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while! I'm just suffocating. Boy...Holly...Holly. Oh, please! We all came to have lunch, didn't we? Hmm. April? Hi. Oh... Where are the antihistamines? Yeah. Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here. At least she isn't drinking. Did you notice? I need an antihistamine. Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...I'd have been a great dope addict. No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me. Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark. She knows it. She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage. Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test. He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock! The sacrifices I've made because of that man. He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his-- his-his-his-his mediocrity! No! I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention. He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart. Hey!
