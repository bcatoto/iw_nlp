All right, what happened to me? Oh, sure. I'm getting used to this. I am Zuul. Fine, Louis. We'll stop in for a drink. Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by. Hi, Louis. I thought I turned it off. I guess I forgot. Oh, that's nice, Louis. I'll stop by if I'm around. No thanks, Louis. I'm really tired. I've been rehearsing all morning. Are you sick, Louis? Hi, Louis. Talk to my accountant. Thank you. Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call. Really! Is it gone? There is no Dana. I am Zuul. I am Zuul. I am ... I want you inside me. Take me now. Do you want this body? He is the Destructor. We must prepare for the coming of Gozer. I am Zuul. I am the Gatekeeper. I've got to go now. All right. Since you put it that way. I don't think so. I'm busy Thursday night. What's he doing in my refrigerator. Hittites, the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians. "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer." You must have gotten the last copy. Can't you tell me now? He is a very close friend. Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment? The "stiff?" He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man. I know. You're quite a celebrity these days. Are you here because you have info ... about my case? Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing. You're good. You heard it? Goodbye. All right. Then leave. I'll scream. Out! That's it. Get out. All right. What do you want to do? Thanks. Coming from you that really means a lot to me. This is terrible. Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy. Are you all right? I told you, I ... I'll wait here if you don't mind. Uh-huh. What? Like a used car salesman. You really don't act like a scientist. That's a violin concerto. Really? Do you have a favorite piece? No. If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real. I'm not ready to do that. No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means. Is that your professional opinion? Why would anyone make up a thing like that? ... and then I opened the door again but it was gone. There was nothing there. Barrett. Dana Barrett. Yes ... well ... I'm not sure. What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.Keep it anyway. I have another one at home. It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow. It's my lucky coin. I want you to have this. That's so romantic. In the physical sense. Egon, there's something very strange about that man. I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you. I'm afraid you're going to die. Remind me not to go to lunch with you. Oh, that's very - unusual. It's a great game! You should play sometime. I bet you'd be good. You seem very athletic. Do you have any hobbies? That's very fascinating to me. I read a lot myself. Some people think I'm too intellectual. But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time. I also play racketball. Do you ever play? You're very handy, I can tell. I bet you like to read a lot, too. Oh, really? Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me. I didn't ask him. All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help. And someone from the EPA is here to see you. Here are tonight's calls. What calls?You're a regular Sherlock Holmes. Now what do you want? What on earth gave you that idea? Yes?
