Hurry boys, we're gonna miss Santa!  She drags them across the street  toward the looming art-deco monolith  that is the big-city department store. That's all right, I'll just take the  single. Uh-huh... yeah... done. I saw you in another mall. Right... Good for you. You're not really Santa. If you were  Santa you could do magic. You want magic? There, I just made you disappear. ...That it? ...Thank fuckin' Christ. Up your ass. Don't tell me which way to have it. Uh, hello, this is Helen Axelrod --  you ran into my car last week? Well  I called State Farm but they have no  record of any insurance policy for  you and -- BOOP! ...Santa? Um... Barbie? He ain't worth it, sugar. He got hit  on last week. Didn't sit too well. Another Grandad, Santa? Got a name? What do you do? I mean, after the  holidays? ...Another? Why not. ...Not a big talker. Buy you one? You're pretty regular, for a Santa. Prove it. Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa! NO! I got a thing for Santa Claus, I  don't know, I guess it's from early  childhood. Maybe because my parents were Jewish  and never celebrated Christmas. Santa  was sort of forbidden, you know? I like you. Most of the people around  here are pretty uptight. My name is  Sue. Here's my number. ...Don't mothball that suit! Roger! You're home. Let me fix you  some sandwiches. Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Screw you, Willie -- last time I  didn't shit right for a week. Yeah some guy askin' 'boutcha --  looked like a cop. Can I help you, ma'am? Oh, look who's here Jimmy! It's Santa!  Let's tell him what you want for  Christmas. Are you insane?!! How dare you talk  like that in front of a child! The  management is going to hear about  this... I'm going to have you fired! YES! YES! YES SANTA YES! Mm. Nice place you got. Needs a bit of a  woman's touch, but it's really nice. Thanks... So how long will you --  urn... ...How long you gonna be here? So what's the thing, you like kids? Wha? I'm talking about you being  Santa. Oh. ...Well -- still -- I gotta thing  for you anyway -- c'mere... So I'll see you soon I guess, right? Roger! You're home! Let me fix you  some sandwiches. Roger! You're home. Let me fix you  some sandwiches. Oh my God... Roger! ...You're home. Let me fix you some  sandwiches. Hello little boy. That was very nice. He's really a  nice kid, isn't he? What? That's okay. That's okay. There, there... There, there...
