�othain! �othain! You take your sister.  You�ll go faster with just two. [As Morwen puts her onto the horse in  front of her brother] Papa says �othain  must not ride Garulf, he is too big  for him! Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras  and raise the alarm. Do you understand  me? [starts to cry] I don�t wanna leave!  I don't wanna go, Mama! Freda, I will find you there. [A woman screams] Quickly! [The children ride off.] [Looks after them] Go child! [Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village,  burning everything in sights as the  Rohirrim scream and run in all directions.  �othain and Freda weep as they look  back from a distance.] [opens his eyes] I think... we might  have made a mistake leaving the Shire,  Pippin. [looks towards the forest] It�s the  trees. Do you remember the Old Forest? On the  borders of Buckland? Folk used to say  that there was something in the water  that made the trees grow tall... and  come alive. Trees that could whisper. Talk to each  other. Even move. Pippin, let�s go. [Their hands still bound, the hobbits  try to crawl away. Suddenly a foot comes  down on Merry and Pippin is turned onto  his back.] Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their  escape.] The belt! [Pippin undoes his belt and Grishn�kh  is left holding it.] Run! Trees! Climb a tree! [Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up  a tree each.] [Looks around and then sighs in relief.]  He's gone. A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest. We�re not Orcs. We�re Hobbits! No, you don�t understand. We�re Hobbits...  Halflings! Shirefolk! Saruman. [Treebeard drops them on the ground  and the hobbits look up at the White  Wizard.] Where�s mama? The light of the Evenstar does not wax  and wane� It is mine to give to whom  I will... Like my heart� Go to sleep... [Bends down to kiss him] Then it is  a good dream. Sleep� [Turns to look at Aragorn] � i vethed...  n� i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han  b�d l�n. (This is not the end... it  is the beginning. You must go with Frodo.  That is your path.) Si peliannen i v�d na dail l�n. Si boe  �-dhannathach. (It is already laid before  your feet. You cannot falter now.) Ae �-esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio  ammen. (If you trust nothing else...  trust this. Trust us.) Why are you saying this? [Closes Aragorn�s hand over the Evenstar]  It was a gift. Keep it. [To �owyn] We�re safe, my lady! Thank  you! Mama! �othain! Freda! [The three hug and cry with joy. Th�oden  and company returns from the battle  with warg riders] Isengard? [The two hobbits climb higher up onto  Treebeard for a better view.] It�s Saruman�s army! The war has started. [Kissing him on the lips] May the grace  of the Valar protect you. I have made my choice. There is still hope. [Crying and moving into her father�s  embrace] Gerich meleth n�n, ada. (You  have my love, father) I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne  nen, han mathon ne chae a han nostan  ned gwilith. (The world has changed...  I feel it in the water, I feel it in  the earth, I smell it in the air.) The  power of the enemy is growing. [Saruman  is communicating with Sauron via the  Palant�r.] Sauron will use his puppet  Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.  Isengard has been unleashed. [View of  Saruman's marching army] The eye of  Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last  free kingdom of men. [View of Osgiliath]  His war on this country will come swiftly.  He senses the Ring is close. The strength  of the Ringbearer is failing. In his  heart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-up  of Galadriel] The quest will claim his  life. You know this. You have foreseen  it. It is the risk we all took. In the gathering dark, the will of the  Ring grows strong. It works hard now  to find its way back into the hands  of men. Men, who are so easily seduced by its  power. The young captain of Gondor has  but to extend his hands, take the Ring  for his own and the world will fall.  It is close now, so close to achieving  its goal. For Sauron will have dominion of all  life on this Earth, even unto the ending  of the world. The time of the Elves  is over. Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?  Do we let them stand alone? What�s that? A gathering of what? [Merry and Pippin turns round as they  hear movement from the forest around  them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard  gathering.] Haleth, son of H�ma, my lord. The men  are saying that we will not live out  the night. They say that it is hopeless.. Fire! [More arrows are released. But the Uruk-hai  army keep advancing, with more replacing  those fallen.] [Angles his head in query] Yes? [impatiently] And what about Saruman?  Have you come to a decision about HIM? Hasty? Our friends are out there! They  need our help! They cannot fight this  war on their own. How can that be your decision?! But you're part of this world! Aren�t  you?! [The Ents look at one another,  taken back] You must help, please! You  must do something! [Looking into the distance.] The fires  of Isengard will spread. And the woods  of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.  And all that was once green and good  in this world will be gone. [Turns to  Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder]  There won't be a Shire, Pippin. Are you mad? We�ll be caught! Yes! They are breaking in! Pippin, hold on! [The hobbits tighten  their hold on top of Treebeard]
