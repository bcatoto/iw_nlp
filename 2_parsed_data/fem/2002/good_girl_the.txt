(v.o.) As a girl, you see the world  like a giant candy store, filled with  sweet candy and such. But one day you  look around and see a prison and you're  on death row. You wanna run, or scream  or cry. But something's locking you  up. Are the other folks cows, chewing  cud till the hour come and their heads  roll? Or are they just keeping quiet,  like you... Planning their escape?  On your left, honey.  What's that cashier's name?  Can't say.  When did he start working here?  Don't know. Yesterday?  Who is he?  Don't know. Can't say.  What are you doing?  It's called work, princess. Kind of  fun. You might want to give it a go  someday.  Attention, shoppers. There's a Retail  Rodeo special on aisle three. Liquid  drain cleaner. Two 12-ounce cans for  $5. Liquid drain cleaner has churning  power and will churn right through your  pipes. Ladies, shove something clean  and new up your filthy pipes. Liquid  drain cleaner on aisle three. Have a  good day and thank you for shopping  at Retail Rodeo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have my own, you know, beliefs.  I kinda like my nights to myself.  Bye-bye.  The same. How was yours?  Bubba, stand up.  For Christ's sakes. Look at that couch,  Phil. Y'all got paint all over it. This  ain't gonna come off. Damn it, Phil.  You two were stoned. You, keep frying  your brain liike that, you'll slip off  a ladder and crack open your head bone.  You do really stupid things when you're  high, Phil.  Like sitting on my couch with your big  blue ass. Everything just turns to shit.  You finally get nice things, then everything  just gets messed up. Why is this TV  buzzing?  Different from what?  What you reading?  What's your name? Catcher?  What's he do?  I notice that you're, uh, not very social.  What do you write?  (to costumer) That's good. Justine will  be right with you. Where is she?  I better go. What happens at the end  of your book?  You don't get paid to pick your crack.  You get paid to work.  I'm not sure I can do makeovers.  Oh, come on! A little pancake, eyeliner,  mascara, rouge on the cheeks and powder  it up. Then you take a moist tissue,  roll it in a ball and toss it in their  face! Jeez, Louise... I'm talking to a  tree stump! Girl, where are you?!  Sorry, I’m just a little tired.  It's the food you eat, Justine. Look  at me. I am 10 years older than you  and have 10 times your energy. Cause  I don't eat meat and I don't eat dairy.  It's probably why you can't get pregnant,  honey. And why you have that hung-jaw  look on your face. It's the cheese in  your pizza and the chicken in your salad.  I went to the doctor. He says I'm fertile.  He says I could repopulate the entire  planet.  Then what's the deal here? Did he say  you get enough vitamins?  He didn't say.  I think you two are a pair of potheads.  You getting a whole one of these or  a half?  You didn't bring this into the store?  Well then, I'll charge you for it. This  is a hand lotion. So don't put it anywhere  else, even if you need lubrication.  We try to keep frivolous lawsuits to  a minimum, unless, ofcourse, the customer  is at fault. Here's your change and  Fuck you very much.  Thank you very much.  Good as new, I'll tell ya, good as new.  Now, you might be interested in purchasing  some of the products I used today...  Well, that'd be a mistake. These are  bargain prices.  I hate my job.  I hate everyone here. I hate Gwen. I  don't know what the hell she's so happy  about. I'm sorry I don't understand  why maniacs get shotguns and shoot everybody  to pieces.  Maybe so. You know you're lips are real  pouty, like a woman. And how your eyes  droop off to the side. How old are you?  I'm an old lady next to you.  How old do you think?  I am thirty years old.  Forever and a day!  You don't have a car?  Well, you can ride in here, there's  room.  I don't know. I'm in a funk.  Okay, Tom.  They call you Tom?  Not aolt to look at. What are your folks  like?  My husband doesn't get me.  Since seven years. He's a painter.  Houses. He's a pig. He talks but he  doesn't think. You go to college?  No, I was afraid I'd lose Phil if I  went. Now that'd be reason enough to  go. I saw you in the store and I liked  how you kept to yourself. I can see  in your eyes that you hate the world.  I hate it too. You know what I'm talkin'  about?  After livin in the dark for so long  a glimspe of the light can make you  giddy. Strange thought come into your  head and you'd better think 'em. Has  a special fate been callin' you and  you not listenin? Is there a secret  message right in front you, and you're  not reading it? Is this your last, best  chance? Are you gonna take it? Or are  you goin' to the grave with unlived  lives in your vains?  Gwen says smokin' marijuana lowers your  sperm.  Maybe you're the infertile one 'round  here. Maybe every time you smoke a little  dooby, you're killin' our unborn children.  Alright, close.  Why you limping.  Yeah, sure okay.  All I know is, everyone should have  one beau, before anyone has two beaus.  He's not my beau, he's my friend.  Happy Halloween Retail Rodeo shoppers!  There's a Retail Rodeo special on all  bulk candy on aisle four. Ghouls and  goblins, witches and warlocks, wandering  these aisles, day after day. I'll put  a Halloween curse on you.  Night Corny. Happy Halloween.  Which ankle did you twist, Holden?  Maybe you should put some cold water  on it so it doesn't sweel up and inflame.  You're a writer so you have yourself  a goal. I used to lie in bed and imagine  other cities, other jobs I could have.  Other husbands. Now I don't even know  what to imagine anymore. Holden, I have  a husband.  Well, Holden. I don't want to hurt anybody.  Oh who gives a shit, who needs a F&$%'  baby around here anyways? If you wanna  make yourself useful, why don't you  get that goddamn TV fixed?!  It sounds like a helicopter is landin'  in here.  You want a blackberry, honey? A man  was sellin' 'em on the road.  No thank you.  Well where is he?  Thanks.  Hey sugar.  Gwen? What's wrong?  Gwen? Gwen you sick?  Well what time is it?  Gwen?  Oh, I had a dream. I had dream that  I sprouted a beard made of bean sprouts.  I'm gonna let you off here, okay?  Okay,You'll meet me inside?  Yeah, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm  gonna park the car, then I'm gonna meet  you inside.  Okay. Your a doll.  I just ditched Gwen at the hospital.  Where are we goin'?  No, with your folks there?  This isn't well planned.  I can't do it.  I don't wanna... I don't wanna go.  Hey.  Gwen got real sick today. She was throwin'  up all over the store. I had to take  her to the hositpal, and sat with her.  No.  It's not funny, Phil, this is serious.  I'm gonna go up there tomorrow too.  And the next day.  What?  Well, how is she?  I bet it was those blackberries.  Stop it, somebody's gonna see!  I'm just this woman. I moved to Texas  when I was eleven. My daddy was in the  Air Force.  Holden gave me two of his stories to  read. It's like what a story would be.  I was about a boy who was put upon,  his mother was cold and selfish, and  his father wanted him to play football.  Other people didn't get him, especially  girls. Then the boy comes to believe  no one can ever really know him. So  he starts actin' out, drinkin', and  doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end  the boy kills himself but jumpin' over  abridge. The second story was pretty  much the same as the first. Except at  the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin'  a bottle of bug poison.  Your stories are intense.  Don't say that. I wish there was a story  about me. I don't know who would read  it though.  I like this. I like havin' a secret.  You gave me a secret Holden.  I'm going to hell, aren't I?  That's Bubba's truck. Get in the car.  Phil takes that truck to work everyday.  Bubba picks him up, and drops him off.  Why, why would that truck be parked  there?  If he finds out about us....  He's big, Holden. He'll kill you. He'll  beat me, but he'll kill you.  I gotta go to the hospital.  Don't! I mean he could be followin'  us.  Who?  What do you mean? I thought she had  a stomach ache?  I don't understand.  Gwen died today.  Parasite. Somethin' she ate.  Where were you this afternoon?  What time did Bubba bring you home?  Oh. I can't believe she's dead. I wasn't  a very good friend to her.  Holden had the notion to go to Gabler's  Creek, skinny dippin' and makin' love.  He said we'd be like Adam and Eve, rollin'  around around in the sticks and the  dirt and bein' one with nature. He was  so fixed on the idea thateven when the  clouds started rollin' in, and the sky  was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin'.  All my thoughts turned to death. I thought  of Gwen's body, rottin' away. I thought  of how nice a person she was, so full  of life and good will. If there was  a heaven, Gwen would be there. Givin'  makeovers and offerin' up helpful advice.  I thought if I died today, what would  happen to me? A hateful girl. A selfish  girl. An adultress. A liar.  What are we doin'?  (sighs) I haven't thought this through.  And go where?  But where will we GO?  I thought you might.  Yeah. She was real healthy too.  Yeah.  Fine.  Not right now, maybe later.  I gotta get home. Maybe Cheryl can.  What, you need a ride?  I think we gotta take a breather. I'm  nervous.  Not today.  Just be patient, Holden!  I was wonderin', when was that, uh,  bible study?  Can I bring my husband?  The Holy Bible. There's one for you,  and one for me.  We're goin' to Bible study. A couple  that prays together, stays together.  Well you heard wrong.  Cheryl? You think you can take this  one?  Sure... Sit right down here ma'am, we're  gonna make you pretty. Now how do you  like your hair?  No, I just need to know if that's your  usual way of wearing it all big and  high. If it is then I'll just put more  makeup on your chin to off-set. Now,  you're gonna want to take a whole bottle  of this home wtih you. It's got quite  alot of ingredients in it so you're  getting a good deal. It's got Ginco  extract in it, do you know what that  is?  It's extract of the Ginco and it makes  your skin real slick so that any liquid  will roll right off, be it water or  lemon juice or urine. I'll put that  in a bag for you.  Phil, what the hell are you doin'? We're  gonna be late for Bible study. You're  stoned, you got paint in your hair,  would you just get in the shower?  Get in the shower.  Yeah, I guess.  What do you mean?  Saw me what?  He left.  Just let the other people do the talking.  Well, that's alright, they'll forgive  us.  Hi Corny. This is my husband, Phil.  Phil, come with me to the car.  Come with me to the car, I gotta get  somethin'.  Just get in the car. Get in the car,  Phil.  I don't want to go to Bible study.  Because I don't want to. Now, can we  please just get out of here?  I don't care. I'm not in the mood.  Why? Beacause we forgot our Bibles is  why.  Yeah, well, they may not, alright. So  can we please just get the shit outta  here?  I don't care, fine by me.  I'm just tryin' to match your face with  your hair, I was thinkin' you're not  white enough.  Well, the first rule of fashion is that  you have to look wierd. What I'm doing  here has come straight from France.  It's called circ du face, meaning circus  of the face and it's all the rage with  the Frenchies.  That's right.  Oh geez, we forgot our Bibles.  Oh. Well, we felt bad.  I can't go.  I can't go today. There's something  important I need to tend to.  Well, something came up.  Um, okay. I think, maybe, somebody's  found out about us.  Well, maybe I don't get you.  That's easy for you to say, Holden,  you are not married.  Holden, you are gonna get us caught!  I won't.  I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay?  Thanks.  Why?  Bubba sat like that for what seemed  like ten years before he began to speak.  Finally, when he opened his mouth, he  talked a blue streak about the ruin  that was his life. He talked about how  he loved Phil, and how he loved me.  And how he always wanted a girlfriend  just like me, and to be a guy like Phil,  to this imaginary girl like me, that  he never found. Then he wen on about  givin' up your dreams and how it's all  a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given  up on his dream to be like Phil, and  accepted his fate as Bubba, always and  forever. Then, last week, a door that  remained shut swung wide open. Bubba  thought this no chance coincidence,  a cosmic force was at work. The sounds  of me makin' love to a man that wasn't  Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear  from the creator himself. What it meant,  or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know.  All he knew was that he hated me for  poisoning the well of idealism that  he had drunk from for so long. I was  no longer Bubba's image of perfection.  To him I was just a liar, and a whore,  and that sickened him. But on the other  hand he loved me for opening his eyes  and releasing him from the bitter chains  of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil  was no superman, just a cuckhold, and  a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba  felt that there was just one thing left  for us to do. Something that would solve  both our problems and end this whole  tragic cycle.  Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you.  But, one person's liberation is another  person's, well, badness. There's just  no way.  Why?  You wanna cuckhold him yourself!  Oh god! There was someone in the window!  Did you not see?  I gotta go.  Get this damn dog away from me!  Great. Good for you.  You're nervous? Why?  You can do it.  Okay.  Oh. Is it? Thanks.  We're not friends.  No, we don't.  Oh my god. What are you doin'?  I saw you. You followed me.  No, Holden, this is all because of you.  He had me over a barrel. If I didn't  sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil  about us!  You've gotta get a hold of yourself!  Are you drunk?  It's not what you think.  Look, go home. Sober up. And meet me  after work.  I gotta help Phil with his sperm.  Just go. Go!  Great.  Mr. Last? Would you come with me?  Good luck, honey.  No, I don't.  Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop  it.  Bubba, I mean it.  Ma'am? Your husband asked me to request  for your presence.  It's Justine. (gets into the room)  You've never done it on your own?  Ah, they're sore. (Justine looks fed  up with everything)  What's wrong with you? You look like  death.  My stomach's crampin'. I feel sore.  Is it your period?  Nah, it's stress.  This job is stressful. I'm breaking  out.  You're breakin' out 'cause you put so  much makeup on your face.  Maybe you're pregnant.  What?... No... (thinks about it)  Oh my god, Blackberries.  Calm down, Holden!  Hey, hey! I am not a hooker.  Why?  I do. I mean I'm depressed but... You  are really depressed.  Oh... I, I promise. (car is parked somewhere;  Justine and Holden are sitting on the  car, Holden's smoking)  I realized then that Holden was at best  a child, and at worst a demon. If I  was ever gonna go straight I'd have  to ditch him. Sometimes, to get back  on the road to redemption, you have  to make a few pit stops.  How much are the blackberries?  Thank you.  Have a blackberry.  Have a blackberry, Holden!  They looked dirty. I, I think I saw  a bug in them or something.  I'm worried about Holden. Tom. I'm worried  about Tom. I just befriended Tom, recently,  and now, well, I think he's mentally  ill. He has this idea in his head that  we've had some sort of affair. Which  is crazy because I'm, I'm married. He's  been sayin' all sorts of strange things,  and makin' threats. And drinkin'. And,  and I just think he would be better  off in a place where people, professionals,  could take care of him. Otherwise, he's  just gonna get himself in trouble.  It's a home pregnancy test.  'Cause I still haven't gotten my period.  Well, I haven't taken it yet. Could  you give me a minute please?  Okay.  Blue?  It means I'm pregnant.  Maybe.  The test could be wrong, Phil. It's  a little early to be havin' a party.  No, I'm excited. It's just, a lot of  worries come with havin' a baby...  Do you think anything's gonna change  havin' a baby?  Yeah, but I mean, do you think anything's  really gonna change?  Hi, this is Dr. Williams returning the  call of Jean Worther. I'm calling from  the Holland County psychiatric hospital.  (Holden hangs up)  Who was it, Tom?  Justine, somethin's goin' on. Something  is definately happening.  Go find out.  It's big. It's very big.  C'mon Cheryl, I'm gonna kill you.  Someone stole fifteen thousand dollars  from the safe. They blew the thing open  with a gun.  Oh my god.  Not only that but the cops know who  did it.  Who?  Somebody who works here.  Cheryl!  Holden, Holden did it. Fool left his  cashier key in the door.  Oh my god.  They can't find him though. They say  he robbed his folks too. You in on it?  What?! No!  I know you two played hookie in the  store room. I never rat on ya, I've  done some things myself. But, still.  You in on it?  I don't know what you're talkin' about.  Suit yourself.  No. I don't know anything.  I hardly know him.  I don't know anything.  Holden, the police are lookin' for you!  Hey! They think that I'm in on it, too!  Corny's got a camera in that storage  room. That Bible thumpin' pervert's  been watchin' us the whole time.  I'm gettin' all goosey. I think I'm  gonna crash. (takes a right turn and  stops the car) I'm pregnant, Holden.  Not necessarily.  Even if it is, you cannot raise a baby  on the run.  I can't go tonight. I gotta pack my  things and I'd have to get more money.  This is all going too fast.  Nothin'.  Okay.  Hey.  Sorry.  Hi.  Thanks.  They just got it wrong, so...  How it all came down to this, only the  devil knows. Retail Rodeo was at the  corner on my left, the motel was down  the road to my right. I closed my eyes  and tried to peer into the future. On  my left I saw days upon days of lipstick  and ticking clocks. Dirty looks and  quiet whisperings. and burning secrets  that won't ever die away. And on my  right, what could I picture? The blue  sky, the desert earth streching out  into the eerie infinity. A beautiful,  never ending nothing.  Hey Justine.  I know where you can find him.  He's at the Hotel Glen Capri, and he'll  be there till noon.  Hey.  Oh yeah. I was doin' laundry.  They gave me the day off.  No.  I thought we were gonna get a day off  and go to the movies....  What?  Hey Phil.  What?  Yes. (he slaps her)  I don't know why.  You're the only man alive that I love.  It's your baby.  It is. I swear. I swear to God.  It doesn't matter.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't.  I'm sorry, Phil.  Okay. Get stoned.  What are those?  Fake eyelashes. Extra long.  Just do it normal for once?  You want me to make the other cheek  purple to even it out?  No.  D'you hear about Corny? He was goin'  home after Bible study last night and  two beefy guys with painted faces pulled  up in a truck and jumped him.  That's terrible.  That day I read the story Holden wrote  for me. It was kinda different from  the other one, but kinda the same. It  was about a woman who was put upon.  Whose job was a prison, and whose life  had lost all meaning. Other people don't  get her, especially her husband. One  day she meets a boy who is also put  upon, and they fall in love. After spending  their whole lives not getting got, with  one look they get eachother completely.  In the end, the boy and the girl run  away together in the wilderness, never  to be heard from again.
