I don't want to leave you. Danny, it's not what you think. Why? I don't want to. What is it? Really, I don't want to. They would have killed you too. No. I want to know what the hell is going on. What's wrong, Danny? Why not? I been that way ever since. From day one. I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em. It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money. He knows where I work. I need my paycheck. We been through that. Please open the door, Danny. It's me. You think you're the only one down here with a sad story? What are you hiding, Danny? There you go again. You're nothing but false notes. You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield. What is wrong with you? Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe? This has nothing to do with him. You really need to lighten up. I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious? Nothing. Is that how you play? And you admire that? Like you? Never heard of him. Trust me. We're safe. Don't worry. He's out of town. What happened to your eye? How? I can't. I've got a kid. She lives with my parents. Quincey knows where they live. Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two. Because he'll kill me. Fuck you. I can't leave. You don't understand. I can't. Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? I hate the son-of-a-bitch. It's not that easy. Go ahead. What? Oh, he's a keeper all right. Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now. Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to. That bad, huh? What about the guy on the very bottom? How? Oh God. Jesus, I look like a raccoon. I understand. Thanks anyway.Why are you doing this? That is so unfair. Here it comes, poor Tom. Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old. Just admit you're wrong. I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost. Look at that place. It's creepy. You think that's a good idea? Tom, quit fucking around. You mean like the Donner Party? Why didn't you just ask for directions back there? No. Right here on the beach. Come on. Let's do it. Tom, let's spend the night here. It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch. And you've got wiener breath. I was talking about Miles. And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it. A virtuoso rendition. TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.It's not too late to show her you're sorry. Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker. I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ... You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding. I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ. Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you. Who is it?
