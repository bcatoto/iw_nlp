You have lied to me for the last time, you lowlife prick bastard!  I don't ever want to hear the sound of your fucking voice again. Yes, well fuck you, too! Could you hurry it along? Get done in there, mister.  I got me an important call. Shit I will!  Finish up! If you got you a cell phone, how come you taking up the whole fucking booth!  This here's an emergency! It's busted.  Every damn phone on Eighth Avenue is busted but this one. I'm gonna pull you out of that booth and snatch you ballheaded! You assaulted my person. You're hear alright.  I'm coming back.  And your ass better not be around. Shepard residence. Hello? What's taking you so long?  I thought we were having some lunch at Mario's? How come? That's disgusting.  Okay, I'll fix us a sandwich.  Where are you now? How come?  The caller ID says you're on your cellular. But you're also in some phone booth? Well just hurry on back. Are you sure you're alone?  I hear somebody in the background. Do you? Stu -- who was that man? Some person who phoned fifteen minutes ago -- just after you went out. This total stranger rang up and told me to wait by the phone -- because you'd be calling me in a few minutes -- from a booth.  And I said what would he be doing in any phone booth? He said you'd be making phone calls.  What else? To whom? Women? You know exactly what I mean. I just feel something is wrong. The way you sound.  You don't sound like yourself. Someone who's scared.  There's fear in your voice like I've never heard before. I want you to come back home.  Now! No.  I want you here now.  In case he calls back, I don't want to answer again. I feel like he's going to. He's not a nobody.  He knows about us. I can't discuss it on the phone.  Just get over here! He been in there all day. He's got him a fucking cellular.  What's he need to be on our booth for? The man don't sound like he means it. It might fit. Kind of pale.  Even for a white man. So how come his hand is shaking? Lookit the sweat pouring off the sonofabitch.  That's one sick mother you started up with, Leon! Whip his arrogant ass. Don't cut yourself, honey. I warned you not to cut yourself. Look at all that blood.  He must've hit an artery. Oh, Jesus.  What is that?  Talk to me!  What happened? Somebody call an ambulance. You shut the fuck up! Why did you do that to him? You all saw it!  He shot my man without no provocation! Hang up and dial 911.  Get a doctor! You're gonna stand there and let him die? That's bullshit.  He's the shooter.  You're talking to the shooter. Go ahead -- make a fucking run for it.  I hope they gun you down -- like you did him! That's him -- in the booth.  He's got a gun! Tell me he's gonna be alright. What do you mean psychiatrist?  He doesn't see any psychiatrist. There was some guy that called the house this morning and said weird stuff to me. He hasn't got many friends -- I can tell you that. You won't hurt him? I was so afraid.  I thought... Remember how you swore up and down you'd get me on TV?  Well, you did.  I already got interviewed on Fox and Channel Eleven and they even want me on A.M. America tomorrow morning.
