Mr. Szpilman. I came specially to meet you today.  I love your playing, but what a  day to choose. My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's  sister. oh! You're bleeding. Take it, don't take it, take what  you like. Can't you see I'm worried  sick? Mama, Wladek's home. Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded. I've been worried sick. Henryk, don't say things like that,  God forbid, God forbid. Papa, Wladek's home. What's it look like we're doing? Pack, darling, get your things,  pack. Out of Warsaw. You haven't heard? Haven't you seen the paper? Where's  the paper? I used it for packing. She used it for packing. All able-bodied men must leave the  city, go across the river and set  up a new line of defence, that's  what it said. Pack, Wladek, there's no time. Good! I'm not going anywhere either! Don't be ridiculous, we've got to  keep together. God forbid! When there's something to celebrate,  you've got to make an effort. Is that all? It's three thousand and three zlotys  too much, 'Re: Further restrictions regarding  liquid assets: Jews will be allowed  to keep a maximum of two thousand  zlotys in their homes.' What are we supposed to do with  the rest? Deposit it in a bank. Blocked  account. We could hide the money here in  the window frame. What d'you mean, take the table  away? Do they? What on earth are you doing? There's a good place under the  cupboard. Quiet! Quiet! Order, please, order! She's a lawyer, she likes order. Listen, just listen. Let's come to  an agreement. We jam the money in  the window frame. The watch we  hide under the cupboard. And the  chain we put in the violin. I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks.  And at last he gave in and said,  'All right, come with me tomorrow,'  and so I came and they bombed the  station. Really? I've always loved your playing,  Mr. Szpilman. No one plays Chopin like you. Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite...  quite wonderful. won't wear it. I'm not going to be  branded. Have you seen this? 'By order of the Governor of the  Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer,  concerning the establishment of  the Jewish District in Warsaw.  There will be created a Jewish  District in which all Jews living  in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will  have to reside."  And look here:  'Jews living outside of the  prescribed area will have to move  to the Jewish district by 31st of  October 1940.' Mama, what is it? Twenty zlotys. That's all we've  got left. What can I buy with twenty  zlotys? I'm sick of cooking potatoes,  potatoes, potatoes. But...but it's a Steinway, Mr  Lipa... Henryk, stop it, leave him alone. I didn't want to come, I didn't  want to see all this, but I couldn't  stop myself. Fine, no, not really, they arrested  my cousin, but Jurek says they'll  let him out. This is disgraceful. That's what I said, it's so - it's  too absurd! I'll sleep with the girls in the  kitchen. You, Henrykc and Papa in  here. Look! Come and look! Excuse me, but have you by any  chance seen my husband Izaak  Szerman? A tall handsome man with a little  grey beard? No? Oh, do forgive me. Goodbye, sleep well, if you see  him, please do write, Izaak  Szerman's his name... Good, they're here. Yitzchak  Heller's been waiting for you,  Henryk. Sit down, have tea, I'll start  lunch when the girls get back. And, please, tonight, for once, I  don't want anything bad talked  about. Let's enjoy our meal. The surgeon? On a Jew? They allowed a Pole to  come in to operate on a Jew? Henryk, I said nothing bad. Boys, boys... Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake, be  quiet! Oh my God, it's terrible, you've  got to do something, oh my God! They're hunting people on the  streets. They've picked up Henryk. Excuse me, but have you seen my  husband Izaak Szerman? He's tall, he's handsome. He has a  little grey beard. If you see him,  please do write, Izaak Szerman's  his name, don't forget. A snatcher! Help me, a snatcher! Where are you taking us? Stop it, Wladek. Let's just hope that Henryk and  Halina will be better off - Where will we be going? Why did I do it? Why did I do it? Why did I do it? Why did I do it? He's dying, don't you have a drop  of water? My child's dying of  thirst, he's dying, he's dying, I  beg you! Henryk! Oh my God! Halina! Henryk! We heard you were here...we...didn't  want...we...we wanted to be with  you. Why did I do it? Why did I do it? Why did I do it? Why did I do it? She's getting on my nerves. What  did she do, for God's sake? What? What? Thanks. Look - oh, do look! Jews! I'll bring you food. wanted to come earlier but... No one thought they'd hold out so  long. Wladek, stop that. It's over now.  Just be proud it happened. My God,  did they put up a fight. They're in shock. They didn't expect  it. Nobody expected it. Jews  fighting back? Who'd have thought? What good? Wladek, I'm surprised  at you. They died with  dignity,  that's what good it did. And you  know something else?  Now the Poles  will rise. We're ready. We'll fight,  too. You'll see. Open this door at once, or we'll  call the police! Are you from the flat in there?  You're not registered. Have you got your identity card?  Let me see your identity card! I want to see your identity card! He's a Jew! He's a Jew! Stop the  Jew! Don't let him out! Yes? Wladyslaw Szpilman. Come in! come in! Sit. Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband. He'll be back before curfew. He'll be here soon. Just over a year. Dead. Christmas. This is not a good time to have  children. But then... This is my husband. Wladyslaw  Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent  him. Wladek? Wladek! I knew it, I knew this would happen! I'm going to get a doctor. I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust  him. He's still a doctor. We came to say goodbye. We're going  to stay with my mother in Otwock.The  baby's already there. It's safer.  There's talk that the uprising  will begin any day now. That man Szalas should be shot.  He's been collecting money on your  behalf all over Warsaw. Apparently,  people gave generously. So he  collected a tidy sum. He told us  he was visiting you daily. Oh God! Can you visit him again? Michal brought food. I'll prepare  something now for you, then we  must go. German! German!
