-- no, this is not my current address.  It was my current address two days  ago when I started standing in line  outside -- -- and so now I lost my apartment, I  have no address, and I have no visa,  and you keep telling me how much  help you cannot give me! All the papers -- all the papers  they asked for -- I brought all the  papers -- You only know that because I told  you! Ask the case officer -- find his  name -- it's on the papers -- I told  him all this myself! -- -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid  him four thousand dollars -- my last  four thousand dollars to marry me,  okay? -- I told this to the case  officer last week... ...here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr.   Thomas I didn't know this guy was  already married -- I admitted this! -- I'm the one that got ripped off! --  not you -- not the United States  government -- me -- I'm the one being  ripped off! You're a U.S. Citizen? Well, either you are, or you aren't. You have your passport? Do you have your passport, sir? Sir, you waited on line. -- you heard him -- let's move it! --  down -- let's go! -- Motherfucking sonsofbitches! What are you looking at? What? Oh, Jesus... It's a little late for that. Get the fuck away from my car. Great. You know what? I'll give you  ten gazillion dollars to get the  fuck away from me before I start  screaming my head off. Jesus... So what's in Paris? For twenty thousand dollars. You have blood on your pants. No. No, that was too easy -- -- get the fuck out of here -- all  this money, this crazy offer, I mean  give me a fucking break with this,  this is -- You swear? That's great. I feel so much better  now. You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car. And I don't get hurt. I get twenty  thousand dollars and I don't get  hurt. What if I say no? Just so you know, if you're gonna  burn me on the money, you might as  well kill me. I was supposed to have this car back  three days ago. It's not my car. Shit -- Can I tell you how much you're  freaking me out? Okay? Because you  are -- you're completely freaking me  out. I don't know. Smile. Sneeze.  Something. You've got a bag full of  money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it,  I don't know... What kind of music do you like? What does that mean? Who pays twenty thousand dollars for  a ride to Paris? Yeah, well, welcome to the club. What? Like amnesia? Amnesia? You're saying you don't remember  anything that happened before two  weeks ago? Give me a fucking break. And you have no idea -- not a clue --  what came before that? When you think of it, before the  ship -- before you wake up on the  ship, what do you see? Well, this is great. I'm sick of myself and you have no  idea who you are. -- you could put it together -- What are you talking about? Sounds like you were in an accident  or something. Okay, so you're a victim. Lots of people have guns. You're  American. Americans love guns. People do amazing things when they're  scared. You're paranoid. You were shot. It's  natural. God, you're not kidding, are you? I needed a break. We're about an hour away. You were tired. Here... For twenty-thousand I like to throw  in breakfast. So what do you dream about? You ever think maybe you have a  family? I guess it's like Christmas every  day for you, huh? That's it? Is that it? Looks familiar? Where? So this is it, right? I should go. Jason... Okay, so... Anytime. You got me pretty fucking curious. Nah... With you, I mean, you'd probably  just forget about me, right? I guess you're not home. It's big. This is like a real apartment. This is really yours? This is your office? God, you live like a monk... See. It's starting to come back,  yeah? You mind if I take a bath? She wasn't kidding about the water.  It's freezing. -- omigod! -- -- what're you? -- no -- no -- -- please -- Jason -- omigod -- ...what are you doing?... omigod -- omigod -- what're you doing? --  what're you doing? -- -- what is he? -- what've you? --  omigod -- what is this? -- -- what're you doing? -- Jason,  please, tell me what's happening! ...omigod, no... ...this is my picture... he's got my  picture -- -- this is me -- this is Zurich --  this... this... this is yesterday -- -- where does this come from? -- How do you have my picture? -- he's got my picture! -- this is  yesterday! -- this is me! -- -- where did you get my picture? -- -- do what? -- what are you doing? --  he's got my picture -- -- he's -- my God -- look at him --  he's bleeding to death -- my picture --  look! -- he was trying to kill us! --  omigod -- He's dead isn't he? He went out the window -- why? --  why would someone do that? He came to kill us. You knew he was coming. I trusted you. I don't trust anybody and I trusted  you! He had my picture! He knew I was  here! He came here to kill us! Oh, Jesus... But the police -- -- we'll explain it -- -- there's two of us -- we'll tell  them -- we'll just -- -- we'll tell them what happened -- He's not lying. He's very highly  stressed, but he's not lying. He's  confused. He's aggressively searching  for a way out of the chaos. This  conversation, the video from the  consulate -- the body language, vocal  pattern -- it's my sense he's really  lost here. I think he snapped. You want clinical terminology? It's  called, "conversation hysteria." I don't know exactly how you train  these people. I'm not sure I want to  know. I'll take a guess there's some  extremely rigorous behavior  modification going on here. You can only wind people so tight.  Even machines break down. Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting. You stayed there five times in the  past six months. But I didn't have  time -- I could only get the bill  from the last stay -- you were there  for two days. Some room service --  there's half a dozen phone calls  here so that's someth-- It's a company... MPG Capital. This can't be it. I found it. It took six calls. I found Kane. I found the body. What? What are you doing? -- -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me... -- I don't know what you're doing  and you're scaring me -- what are  you looking for? -- what just happened  in there? -- What is that? What does that mean? Jason, what does that mean? Jason, please... who is he? So what are we doing? It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all  that matters. We have this money. We have what we  have. I had nothing before and now,  I don't know, maybe I have more,  maybe it's nothing, but... I say we leave here. We leave this  place. We go until we can't go  anymore. Yes. That's who I want to be. xxxxxx xxxxxx What? Jason... Who is it? Who's out there? xxxxxx xxxxxx Did we lose them? Who is it? xxxxxx What are you doing? xxxxxx Give me the gun -- xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Jason... We've got to go. And that's it? What was I thinking, right? What about you? Can I help you? Yes. You have ID? It's not a problem.
