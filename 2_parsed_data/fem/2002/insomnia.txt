A CAT jumps down off the roof.  Angstrom sprays it. They look down.  Ellie reaches up and takes Will's bag.  Then his hand.  Shakes it vigorously. Will motions to Hap. She leads them away from the plane.  Takes Will's briefcase. Opens the back of the Jeep.  Puts the bags inside. The Pilot walks by.  Taps her on the shoulder. She looks back at Will.  Can't help but focus in on his scar. Touches her own smooth neck.  In awe. Will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance. She throws a quick glance at Angstrom.  Out of ear-shot. Backs out.  Quietly closing the door behind her.  Will unbuttons his jacket.  Takes a seat. They turn.  Ellie's come up behind them.  Looks over at the hunched figure to Fred. Fred stops up ahead.  Sees her.  Annoyed. They turn.  RACHEL CLEMENT stands in a doorway behind the desk.  Dunking a teabag into a mug.  Long dark hair and intelligent eyes. Hap smiles at her.  Will checks his watch. She hands them two cards. Will takes the bag.  Looks inside.  Yikes. She shifts down.  Takes a steep turn. They pass a MAN walking along the road.  Gnarled walking stick.  Ellie calls out the window. JOE waves.  They pass. Will looks over at her.  Smiles. Stops.  Looks over.  Realises Will's teasing her. Will heads into the room.  Hap follows.  A palpable uneasiness between them.  Fred and Ellie stand in the doorway.  Mrs. Connell turns to go. Fred throws Ellie a look.  "Kids?"  She's practically a kid herself.  Will opens the top drawer of the bureau.  Roots beneath the panties. Will looks around.  Cheap wallpaper, torn window screens. Will smooths back his hair.  Checks his tie. Will stops.  Ellie stops.  Will puts a hand on her shoulder. Will, has to smile.  She's quick.  Looks down the hall.  A bearded GUY on crutches.  Ellie follows his gaze. The men look up, interrupted.  Rachel is standing by the table with a pad.  Hap tries to recover with a big smile. Will stands abruptly.  Eyes on Hap.  Trying not to explode. Will and Hap head over to them.  One of the younger guys, FARRELL, intimidated by Will's presence.  Tucks his shirt into his dirty jeans. They part to reveal a BLUE KNAPSACK laying on the desk.  Mud spots all over it.  An embroidered daisy.  Will examines it. Fred tightens his jaw. Ellie appears with a thermos.  Crouching down.  Fred turns, annoyed. Will puts up his hand.  She stops short.  He plunges ahead. Hap.  Will.  Farrell.  Fred.  Fanning out.  Silent.  Keeping eye-contact.  Will points to Farrell.  Wants the megaphone. Farrell, balancing on a rock, holds it out.  Accidentally keys it.  The feedback SQUAWKS.  Fuck. Will turns his back to her.  Nyback heads over. Nyback puts a hand on her shoulder. Will looks at her.  She walks over to the desk. She reaches for his key. Will takes his key. Will stops.  Turns.  Rachel holds up the phone.  Covering the mouthpiece. Will's stomach drops.  That's the last phone call in the  world he wants to take.  Rachel reads his face. Will shakes his head.  Steps back and takes the phone. Clears his throat. He turns.  Ellie is beside him, holding a map. She holds out the map.  It's of the small stretch of coastline.  Red circles marking various points. Will looks down at her.  Takes the map.  Turns it around. Will points to a spot.  Cutting her off. Farrell smiles at her, winks at Will. Ellie emerges from the fog.  Carrying the map and talking into a small tape recorder.  She's climbing over the rocks, wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big. A UNIFORMED OFFICER follows, carrying a camera.  She turns to him. She climbs over the same bank Will Dormer climbed two evenings before.  Finds... ANOTHER UNIFORMED OFFICER, hanging out and smoking. He looks up.  Pimples on his chin. Francis looks up at her.  Flicks his cigarette away and gets down amongst the rocks.  Holds his thigh like he was shot. She stops.  Looks at the map.  At the spot Will pointed out. A VOICE calls back.  Someone pretending to be Hap. Will takes it.  Preoccupied. Will nods, rubs his forehead.  Suddenly has a pounding headache.  Turns for the stairs.  Hesitates. She sips on a take-out coke.  Looks back at the game.  A plump, redheaded GIRL comes up to bat.  Blows a bubble. Will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss by a mile.  Ellie cups her hands around her mouth. Libby takes another swing.  Connects with the ball.  Drops the bat and runs to first.  Ellie gives a sharp WHISTLE. Will leans back.  Stretching his legs.  Remembering. The row of DADS behind them.  Jump up and start CHEERING. He turns to go, scanning the area.  Ellie calls after him. Will glances at it.  Takes the phone.  Rubs his eyes. He closes his eyes.  Now is not the time.  Reaches the Cherokee.  Yanks open the driver's side door.  Ellie catches up with him.  Out of breath. She smiles, holds up some PHOTOGRAPHS.  They're of the BEACH. The ones Kepp took.  Almost all fog. Will.  Barely glancing at them.  Tosses the box into the car. Will, about to seriously lose his shit.  Looks at Ellie. Eyes dark, distant. PULL BACK to reveal Kay Connell's funeral.  PEOPLE standing by the grave, most of them HIGH SCHOOLERS.  The sky's a brilliant blue.  Red fireweeds blanket the hillside. The young girl looks up.  Folds the paper closed.  People SNIFFLE.  Mrs. Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm. Some CHILDREN.  Start circulating with plastic buckets. Filled with white carnations.  Handing them out. Will, shifts.  Looks over. She stretches.  Her midriff showing.  Shifts her body towards Will. Will looks over at her.  She blows out a plume of smoke. Smiles.  Seductive. She reaches out a sinewy arm.  Starts massaging the back of Will's neck. Will, impervious to the touch.  Head, throbbing.  Reaches for the gear.  His foot, pressing harder on the gas. Will staring dead ahead.  Tensing his jaw.  The TRUCK... bearing down on them... Tanya reaches for the wheel...Will pushes her hands away... The TRUCK...a breath away... Will reaches in and pulls her out of the car. Will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates. Pushes her down the other side.  She stumbles. Will stands above her, on the hill.  His face set like stone. Will straightens.  He's heard that name before. Suddenly Tanya jams her heel into his shoe.  He CRIES out. She breaks away from him.  Runs up the hill.  Turns.  Tears streaking her face.  Throws the carnation to the ground. More FEET running over. A tingle, all across Will's body.  Christ.  This girl's everywhere!  He hunches into his coat.  Flicks up his collar. Doesn't want her to see him fully.  Nods down the road. She pulls a folder from her bag. Will takes the file.  Flips it open.  The death of his partner.  Neatly typed.  Neatly stapled.  Pulls out a pen. Ellie looks over at Will as they cross the street.  Studying his face.  His gait.  Noticing the slight limp in his right leg.  The cut on his forehead. They arrive at the stone steps of the Pioneer Lodge. Will, finally looks at her. Will stops, turns to look back at her.  Confused. Slings the bag over her shoulder. Will gives a half-smile.  Fucking irony.  Heads back into... Will grabs up a sweater. Will.  Cramming the sweater into a crack. He grabs a magazine. He stops.  Looks down at her hand. Will suddenly realises what he's doing.  Absurd.  Pathetic.  Pitiful.  Slowly turns to face Rachel. Her eyes, looking up at him.  His shoulders droop. Exhausted.  Rachel reaches up.  Catches him in her arms. Strong arms.  Caring.  Will buries his face in her neck. Wants to be swallowed up. Rachel holds him.  Arms encircling.  Will breathes her in. Sweet, soft, safe. Looks up.  His mouth suddenly finding hers.  A kiss, hungry, urgent.  His arms move to surround her. Will turns slowly over to face her.  Her hair, splayed out on the pillow.  Her cheeks, flushed.  Her eyes, listening. Will closes his eyes.  The rain, PATTERING.  Rhythmic. Looks out the window. Fred shoots Ellie a look.  She closes her mouth. They look up.  Ellie standing by their table.  Jeans, down vest.  Hair tousled. Fred leans back in his seat.  Eyeballs Ellie. Will, blanches. Rich throws peanut shells at her. Everyone turns to Will.  Their faces, spinning.  He nods. He looks up.  Holds her gaze.  Then turns away.  Grabs the side of the table. We hear the TV in the other room.  An older MAN, Ellie's father, appears in the doorway.  Thick glasses, grey stubble, big paunch.  Wearing a flannel robe. An awkward beat.  Ellie walks over to Will.  Looks up. Suddenly throws her arms around him. Will holds his hands out.  Not sure what to do.  Looks down at the top of Ellie's head. Will walks up to her.  Puts his arms around her.  Holds her, smells her, kisses her neck.  Pulls away.  Looks into her eyes. He doesn't answer.  The cat, rubs against his leg.  PURRING. She stops.  Rachel behind her.  Taking in the strange feeling in the room.  Walks over to the bed.  Eyes riveted on the 39/13.  On the bullet.  Rachel, behind her. Ellie, her mind races.  Notices TORN PHOTOGRAPH PIECES in the trash can.  Reaches in and pulls some out.  A puzzle. Pulls herself over to a SIDEBOARD for cover.  Shrinks behind it.  Notices A PLASTIC BAG sticking out from one of the drawers.  Nudges it open.  A flowered dress, some panty-hose, strands of long dark hair... Will squints against the rain.  Makes out the face of ELLIE hovering over him.  He gives a half-smile. Will looks at her bloody shoulder. Will, fading fast. Will nods. Will shakes his head. RAIN, drumming down around them.  Will, takes a deep breath. Will reaches up a feeble hand.  Stops her. Will opens his eyes.  She ties the second sock around his arm. She gets up.  Slips her arms under his shoulders.  Starts hoisting him up. Will.  Struggling to his knees.  Every inch of him, screaming in pain.  Gets to his feet.  Arm slung around this tiny, young woman. And they head, slowly but surely, back down the dock.
