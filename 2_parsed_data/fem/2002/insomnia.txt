Sure. Good. Didn't want to miss anything. Yes, sir. Don't worry. I'll have a cool scar. Why? I know. Worth pursuing? Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop? A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing. A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him. You said that once, remember? About an hour ago. Said he was more than happy to cooperate. Five feet? Seven feet? How much closer would you say you were? But here's the thing. I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there. I mean, not in that fog. Okay. That must have been awful for you. Oh, I shouldn't have... Twelve years younger. The Puffins and the Hawks. We're in extra innings. The Hawks have a really good line-up this year. Oh. We always have play-offs in the middle of the night. It's the best time. Yeah. All over. The bartender at Darrow's. He was there Friday night. But there wasn't any... We already did. Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in. But they're so boring. All small stuff. Don't worry about him... Actually... Detective Eckhart! I know! Welcome to Nightmute!What if someone finds out? Will. One of your cases? There's a guy down the hall. Complaining about the noise. Says he can't sleep. Will...I... That's not what he thinks. No. He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him. I got it. Don't know why I bother. It's been broken for two years. Your friend's all business.Brody...I don't know... ...Something Brody! She used some stupid code name. My arm! She kept saying she was gonna get out of here. Leave us all behind. That <i>he</i> was going to take her! It was like some big fucking secret! She wouldn't tell me! I don't know. No... That's what I said. Hey... Long as it's fun. We were like sisters. Knew everything about each other. Since grade school. I was her best friend. What are you doing in this shit-hole town? I never met anyone from Seattle before.
