Soon then. I�ll save the last dance for you. They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess. You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant. That was another time. But we do have one advantage. He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first. I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating. As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying. The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you. Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal. Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else. Is he very much like you were? He turned out all right. He was a bit proud as I recall. You're working late. It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds. About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell. If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency. There�s no crying in Starfleet. Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it? It'll serve you right.But how can he? He'll kill you. The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me. Captain -- I might have a way to find them. How can you be certain? Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties. Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him. Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you. The same way you want to know him. I don't know. I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow. And I you. I don't believe that, sir. We�ve shared many disappointing journeys. The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations. It's about Data I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9. Do you have a moment, sir? With pleasure, Captain. And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know. Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast. No. You're not here. You sick bastard! This isn't real. No! I'm only half human.Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out. Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant. There's more... as always. He's Reman. A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
