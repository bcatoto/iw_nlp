Who's upset? People fall in love,  they have to climb back out. So, what? We'll just be friends now,  Right? I see. Well I appreciate your honesty. No. I'll just think of this as  surviving another dating accident.  Take care or good luck or whatever  I'm supposed to... ...say... Goodbye. That's impossible! She wasn't supposed  to return until... ...The 7th Duke... ...of Albany. He was the... IS the  son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no  actual importance until he vanished  at the turn of the century without a  trace. It was a sensation. In the  30's they even made a movie about  him. "The Tenuous Duke" with Ronald  Coleman. Despite much speculation and a nation  wide investigation, a body was never  found. He was never heard from again. Calm down. Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now,  no one would believe such a stupid  mistake could be made because no one  would believe any of this is possible.  So. We fix this. We keep this to  ourselves and we fix it. Fast. Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st  priority: Locate Carlson. Drake,  determine the reciprocal correlation's  connected to the 19th century. Work  24 hours a day if necessary. In the  meantime... one of us will have to  take charge of him. This is a major scientific  opportunity. It doesn't get any better  than this. Imagine. Researching the  behavior, the physical and emotional  characteristics of a century ago!  Utilizing technology available to us  today... He's a gold mine! And while he's here, he's ours. Any  volunteers? Fine. Your Grace... Um... Hello... Weee  aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge  research team. A project funded by  the government of the United States. Yes, um... For the past six and a  half years we've been conducting  scientific experiments on density  and flexibility in the dimensions of  time and space. We journeyed to your time because it  was the quickest path to follow. We  debated long and hard whether we  should use this knowledge at all.  Believe me, it was never our intent  to disturb the past... We certainly don't want to  miscalculate. Send you to a different  era entirely. Leopold, wait! Squab. I remember reading they ate a lot of  squab. I don't know! You're going to be fine you know.  There's nothing to worry about. I  have everything under control. We'll never get away with this. How are you feeling? I thought you might like some tea. I understand. We're doing our best. You're speaking to him. Dr. Coles. If you like, you could  call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's  too much, how about just plain Kate? Hard to believe? Interesting. Nevertheless, we've  come a long way baby. I'm attempting to be informative  it's just coming out humorous. Look, modern social science clearly  states that a woman's place in society  marks the level of that civilization.  A science career for a woman is now  almost as acceptable as being a...  a... waitress. Cream and sugar? Does that make you nervous? Then what are you getting so red  about? It's a very large apartment...  with locks on all the doors. Dr. Coles. Let's get one thing straight right  now. My name is Kate or Katherine or  if you insist Dr. Coles. Take a good long look, Leopold. I am  a 20th century American woman with a  Doctorate and a commission and  independence. I am not your "young  lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your  "honey." Is that clear? ...I'll get it for you. Oh, just some laundry, the cooking,  a little light housework... I took the liberty of preparing a  simple schedule to efficiently utilize  your time while incorporating you  into my routine. As you can see, my day begins with  meditation and yoga from 6:30 to YOU will arise at 6:45, shower and  change and at 7:15, we breakfast  together. 7:45 we begin the days  work. At 10:45 Dr. Kau arrives to  observe you in your natural routine  as I research the data that will  enable you to return home. At 1:15  we lunch together. 2:15 you answer a  daily questionnaire, I type up my  notes. At precisely 6:15 you will  enjoy 15 minutes of FREE TIME, then,  at 6:30, I listen to Tom Brokaw while  making dinner as YOU write down any  questions that come up during your  day. At 7:00, we dine together. If  you need me at any time you may ring  this bell. Now, Mondays and Wednesdays I have  computer science class, Tuesdays I  have therapy. IF I have a date, I'm  usually home by 9:15. During these  periods you may read any of the books  I've picked out for you in your room.  I organize my next days work at 10:30,  11:35, David Letterman, 12:40 I'm in  bed. Next day we begin again. Simple? Kate? I'm home. Oh. Yes. Our chaperone is here. Sort of. My brother. For the past two years. Charlie can  never know about this project. We'll  tell him you are a... overly  distinguished colleague staying here  as our guest. From Canada. Which  would explain your lack of familiarity  with our customs and so forth Make yourself comfortable. I'll check  in on you later. I think this is  going very well, don't you? Okay. If you need anything, just  ring. Charlie! Come here I wanna talk to you. RINGS! And what did I say about you  smoking in the house? Correct. You're back early. Funny ha ha or funny odd? That all depends. How was your trip? If it was good I'll tell you the  truth. If it was rotten I'll have to  butter you up first. Have you been working out? No, I'm  really starting to see results. Are  you comfortable there on the couch? Good. Cause you'll be sleeping there  the next few nights. You have to be out of here by 8 and  you can't be back before 6. We have  an important man working with us  with very unusual needs. The company  is insisting he stay here. This man requires around the clock  attention. Thank you, Charlie. I owe you one. You could get a job! Well, I can't tell you much because... I'm not allowed to discuss what goes  on at the office. Well I'm not. Anyway, it might be  interesting to have someone else to  talk to. It gets so quiet around  here sometimes I feel like I've gone  deaf. Leopold. He's exactly like his name. He's from Canada... It's called Hamburger Helper. I'm afraid there is no next course.  If you make a list of the foods you  like, I'll pick them up at the store  for you. Charlie... Leopold... Since you're our guest  here, there are several cultural  events you might enjoy seeing. Charlie  has season tickets to the ball game.  Perhaps you'd like to take that in? Or the Opera or the Ballet? Charlie, there's no rule that says  everyone has to be interested in  baseball. CHARLES, could you help me with the  dessert in the kitchen? IN the kitchen. Excuse us. Try to be nice to him. Please Charlie, as a favor to me. He's different that's all. Charlie, this is important to me. Eeuuu! I may be desperate but I'm  not a lost cause. I've done countless favors for you!  Now I'm asking for just one little  thing... We forgot the dessert. What is it, Leopold? Leopold, your time is up! What's he  got, a girl in there? In our last session you intimated  there was a symmetrical system  regulating the social order of  conformity spanning your era. I found  this particularly intriguing If I  can just find it in my notes... Found it. No I meant I found my notes. I can hear you. I never... A horse? In New York City? Thank you! And I have a news flash of my own. You sir, are no Ronald Coleman! Fine. Fine... Why? What did you hear? Oh. Well, it's fine. He's a delight.  Everything's under control. GONE? GONE WHERE?! When did he leave? And you let him?? He's not allowed  to go outside! We've got to find him! You stay here  in case he finds his way back. And  while you wait you'd better pray  he's all right. If anything happens  to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING  we've worked for will have been  destroyed. And YOU'LL be responsible. Understand? Leopold... is not really from Canada. You stupid fucking son of a bitch.  Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! You tell him. Leopold! Leopold, get in. Leopold! Oh, Leopold thank God you're  all right. I didn't think I'd ever  find you. You had us all so worried.  Oh, Leopold! Don't you ever go out again without  my permission, do you hear me? I was  frantic. You could have been killed  a hundred times over. I never would  have known. Leopold, are you all right? Okay. I'll get you home in a jiffy. Charlie, don't start. I haven't been  this angry at you since you got me  into that pyramid thing last year.  If you make a wisecrack I'm going to  burst into flame. I'm too tired for this now. I'll  just save it up and kill you tomorrow.  Help Leopold out of his things and  lets get him to bed. Don't mind him. His heart would be  in the right place if he had a heart.  Surliness runs in my family. Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one  that's not at my expense. That's  good. Yes... I start work... in three and a half hours. It's fine. I'm used to it. Oh! Leopold?... I don't have a clear  handle on this. Perhaps I was wrong  keeping you confined to the apartment  all this time. I don't know when  you'll be able return home... Tomorrow  I'll start preparing you for the  outside world. And... We'll find  your way back. I promise. Yes? Is there something you want, Leopold? Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of  us. I'll be out in a minute. Certainly I'm certain. Put it back. Back! Women are longer defined by the men  they're married to, Leopold. I have  a career. I haven't found a man who  fits in with that yet. I've heard of cases. There's nothing wrong with me! I don't know what you're talking  about. You think I'm THIRTY?! Do I look THIRTY to you? You chose it specifically opposed to  a lower number. ...Thirty! I'm thirty! But you're the first  person whoever told me I looked it! And it's not that I insist on  remaining single. Believe me. Everyone  dreams of finding somebody to share  their life with. To give someone all  the love they've been hoarding since  they were a kid. I'm no different.  But one has to be sensible. I have a  career and a life that's filled  with... Not again... What do I have to do? Put a leash  around your neck? What?... What? This is ridiculous. I don't have  time to... Do you know what this dress costs?  Let's get this over with. I'm coming  out. Nobody laugh. Satisfied? ...What? The drug of the 20th century. Leopold, your dinner's getting cold. It's a guy thing. ...Now within that astronomical  structure, Dr. Drake here is searching  for a pathway between your time and  the present. He'll find it too if  his arteries don't harden first. Once that is discovered, the search  begins for the exact time and date  travel will be possible. Don't take it personally. Once Dr.  Kau starts working, you just have to  wait until her batteries run down.  We're all pretty much like that. I'm a genius. Thank you. And may I say that  sometimes, in DIM light, you're not  so bad yourself. Oh my God! Is that the time? I'm  late. Therapy. Every Tuesday night. You mayn't. No one does. That's why therapists  can charge so much. Leopold. A gentleman does not ask  those questions. Come on, we'll get  you home. All right. Don't bite my head off. Oh, for heaven's sake... I was worried. I thought you weren't  going to make it. Miss my lesson? This is the only  thing I have to look forward to all  week. Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus? I am! It is! I've got the muusic in me. She's another Babe Ruth. We had no  idea. Are you okay? What do you have to say for yourself,  Elizabeth? I'm sorry! C'mon honey, lets go. I want my ball. It's margarine. Me too. Work to do. Where are you  going? Say hello to Dennis for me. As a rule I don't like to associate  with really good looking people. It  makes me feel really... I don't  know... Smart. But Dennis is a nice  guy. That's a wonderful idea! Leopold  mentioned how he wanted to meet...  People of quality was it? Nonsense! Charlie, you don't want to  hurt Leopold's feelings. He's going  to think you don't want him to go. Royal family -- Uncouth. Making Out --  slow soulful kissing... Woman as  equals?? Who drove the Chevy to the levy and  why was it dry? Eyes shine when she talks about...  science. Raises her voice when she  knows she's wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY,  BOSSY. Lose my train of thought when  I see her smile. Most beautiful when  she's angry. Honorable heart...  Peasant feet. Ooops. Bread and butter. Bread and butter. It's an old  saying... Well not to you I guess.  You say it when you pass someone in  a cramped space. As close as bread  and butter. So. Did you have a good time last  night? Did you find that person of quality? Well... fine. I guess it's time to turn in. Goodnight. Good morning. You're up early. Happens all the time... Oh. It's my computer. I'm researching the correlations  between your time and the present. I'm TRYING to get you home, Leopold. It's made me the man I am today. Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I've  got too much work to do. Ask Charlie  though. He'll go with you. Oh, Leopold. I'm so sorry. I can't. Yes... Thank you. Oh for crying out loud. Would you  look at this? Leopold? The computer's  on the blink again. Cheap piece of equipment. I can't... NO, no, it does this all the time.  Just have to wait it out. Darn. Oh, you think? I... I must have gotten a funny  horse... That's simplicity in it's purest  form. It speaks volumes in it's  nothingness. Whiteness representing  emptiness. Hopelessness. It's bleak.  Bleak! Absolutely nothing. VIP, VHS, VCR. I don't know. K.D. Lang. So am I. Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night. A blind date. No, that just means I haven't met  him before. It was set up through  friends. A hazard of single life... I'm turning  in. I'm sorry. Leopold? I had a wonderful time today.  I can't remember the last time I  took the day off and just played.  I'd forgotten how beautiful this  city can be... I want to thank you  for that. Just don't swipe the silverware and  give yourself away. No name calling. How do I look? Thank you, Leopold. You look very nice, Charlie. That must be him. Blind date. This is always the scary part. "Open the door to my, Mystery Date." Larry? Well, I'm off. Now? What are you talking about? That isn't necessary. I'll be fine. Goodnight, Leopold. Goodnight. Thank you. I beg your pardon? Undecided. About you? Ah, she said you were  tall. And nice looking. Thank her. And that you persevere  ardently on Wall Street. That must be very interesting. No. Aaand that's about all Jeannie said.  What did Jeannie say about me? Quite a compelling portrait. A masterpiece. Who? Goodbye. Don't get up. Leopold? Leopold? Oh, Leopold... Oh! No. Here, you've got some... No. A funny thing happened to me on my  bland date this evening, Leopold. I  really can't explain it. This puffed- up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn  kept popping into my mind all night  long at the most inopportune times.  I couldn't get rid of him. Yeah, it was. The harder I tried,  the more persistent he became. He's  conceited and inflated and unseasoned  and it doesn't seem to matter...  He's 134 years old but I can't get  him out of my head. Right here. Larger than life. Permission granted. YOU do. What have you got there? Hamburger Helper! Um, where was I? So after my father  died I had to go to work. Many. I got fired from all of them.  I'm the most unskilled person I know.  But they were just survival jobs  while I was still in school. I always  knew I wanted to go into science  like my father. And I did. I think about him every day. He was  courtly, just like you. You just don't get out much. You'd  be surprised how remarkable I'm not. Morning. Look what you've done! Nothing? My own mother never made me  a breakfast like this. Leopold... About last night... I sense the word "BUT" entering into  this any minute now. Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry  you? That's entirely beside the point...  You're moving way too fast here.  Shouldn't we date first? I mean it's  obvious the first one went well... Leopold, even though last night we...  loved each other, that doesn't mean  this morning we're engaged. It just  doesn't work that way now. Oh Leopold, sit down. Relationships these days are much  more complicated than that. Women  today have certain freedoms that men  have been taking advantage of for  centuries. You must have been aware  of that. If you think about it  clearly, it should be obvious to you  that marriage between us is out of  the question. Don't ever think that... I'll think it over but I can tell  you now the answer is... Possibly. Do what you have to do... Of course. Say when. Sorry. Fine! I'm fine. What are you reading? As a pee-pee girl? Leopold, I don't know if that's such  a good idea. You have to be patient. You're awfully cute when you get  causey. Hi. What's the matter? So you know. I'm not sure. You don't understand. No... No, no, no. It's time. Leopold's going back. Yup. I'll get his things together.  Tell him tonight. I'm fine. Well I am. It was wonderful having  him here, Charlie. He was of  invaluable assistance to the project. I'll miss him. I will. What am I supposed to DO, Charlie??  I can't go back. He can't stay. I  can't let him go. I'm not equipped  to deal with this, Charlie. I don't  know how. I'm not! It's too much, Charlie. It's just  too much. I didn't know I could feel like this.  I really didn't know. What? I'm fine. It's time. We're sending you back. A week from Friday, early morning. It was a mistake, Leopold. It's out  of our hands. We can't POCKET people  from history like stolen jewels. We  haven't the right... I'm sorry. We'll  miss you. What do you want me to do, fall apart?  You'd still be leaving. It wouldn't  solve anything. What do you want me to say, Leopold? Leopold! You should see what I'm looking at. That was pound cakes ago. Where were  you? Such as? We should have come up with something  together. I might have been spared  ten or seventy pounds. I'm sorry for what I said. Yes you are... But? You can't! We have no right  to... Have you thought about what you'd be  sacrificing? Your influence? Your  authority? Your family, your whole way of life,  everything? You're not just feeling sorry for me  because I ate the contents of the  refrigerator, are you? Here comes the mushy part! That's good, because if you're staying  I'll probably get fired again. What  do you desire? ...PTA? I love you too. I do, Leopold. I  love you, too. Do you think I'm not aware of that?  Do you think a minute goes by that I  don't feel responsible for her? But Maybe this is her destiny. Maybe  she's of more important use back  there. You're going back aren't you? You said you wouldn't leave me...  I've never been lucky. Not one time. I wouldn't WANT you to change. That's  what's tearing me up inside. Either  way I lose... You've changed me too.  I can't go back to my old life  anymore. I can't live like that again.  God my heart is pounding like a drum.  I've never been so scared in my life.  Take me with you, Leopold. God. Take  me with you. I'd be with you. Just ask me... Just ask. Yes! Where are you taking me? Leopold? I don't have any words for this. I know. I know. I brought you something. So you wouldn't forget me. So you wouldn't think this was all a  dream. Don't forget about me. Wait for me. I will come back to you! I will! He's waiting for me. I can feel it.  Oh, Leopold... Leo you don't have to holler like  that. I'm not deaf... ...Carlson?! Carlson, I don't believe it. It's  been... I don't know how many years.  What are you doing here. You remember my son, Leo? Well, come inside. Come inside. Would you like some tea? I wish you  had called before you come over. It  would have given me a chance to  straighten up the house... myself...  my life. Tell me what you've been up  to. Catch me up on everyone. I heard  you received some big endowment or  something. I was going to write,  then call, but... Just an old friend. Nothing important. You brush your  teeth? Then give your old mom a hug and go  to bed. Good night, cookie. He's so YOUNG, Charlie. Look at that idiotic expression on  his face. Of course he's happy. All weddings  are happy. It's the living together  afterwards that causes all the  trouble. Oh, you're so young... I love you,  Leo. Always remember that... I know, cookie. I know. Well... What will I do without you, Charlie? Leo... But... I've never seen her before.
