You're fucked up, Lila. Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake. Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested. Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help. It's not so bad. So, it just keeps growing? I don't know why you didn't tell me about this. Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.French? Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union. I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you. You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie. You remind me so much of Nathan. Say my name. Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked. Hello, my little boy. Okay. Please let me go with you. Okay, my sweet. Good night. That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No? Where do we look for little lost Puff? We still have you and I. Oui. Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong. A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri. That's Lila? So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men. Don't be silly! And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir." You were wonderful! You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig? Hunh. That's not how he tells it. I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry. I've moved on. Anyway. Come already to the point. Please. I look a mess. Well? You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here! You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need! What for? Like what? Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you! We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what! Call you back. You bastard! What do you want? Yeah? What? Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love! The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too. You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you. But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan. No! It is now that you must decide. I love you, Doctor Nathan... ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish. My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you. You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this. Stop. Get away. Not in front of the boy. Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I. Hmmmph. Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself. I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do? Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please. Lila. What is wrong, my darling? Shh. You are sweet. Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment. Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower. I am sleepy. Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad. It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no? Shall we close up, then? Oui. I should turn them off. Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl. Coincidence, yes? And how is our son? I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over. See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed. Is everything fine? Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry. Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left. I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid? You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you? I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no? Thank you so much for accompanying me. I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now? Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and... Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps? Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you. Now I'm embarrassed that I say this. Oui. Perfect! Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute! I loved my doggie very much, monsieur. Oui. Oui, doctor, oui.Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles? How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly? Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows. It's embarrassing, okay? Nothing! I'll be out in a minute! Okay. If you think it will help. That's what I'm counting on. No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail. Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life. No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody. He's dead. You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you. Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason. Good. I'll show you how, apey. You what? We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it. Very well. It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's okay, Puff. I'll be in touch. I'm really glad you two found each other. Shut up, you. Oh, Rosie. Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will. Ready! Oh, Rosie. Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair? Your brother should have his license revoked. How'd you know where I was? Rose, please go away. Go the fuck away, Rosie. No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob? And I think I'm going to. Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him. Three foot one. I have a friend you might like to meet. I didn't know you were into that sort of thing. Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill? One night stand? He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something. Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with. I cannot believe how in love I am with this man. Really? I really like him, Rose. He's so... ...passionate about his work. God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff. Won't he be able to tell? Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he? What do you mean? Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose. Shut up and tell me. Tell me. I could use someone up my alley. Always. Ow. I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl. Ouch. Yeah? Ooka. Oook. Oook. Ugnh. Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best. Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie. How the hell would you know anything about the human heart? I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair! Do you know what I gave up to be with you? And what did you do tonight, honey? And what did you do tonight, honey? That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore! Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey? So he's doing okay? You were gone a long time. Ummm. It's good. Should I come with? Absolutely! You just have to control it. We're not apes. Oh boy! That was wonderful! I had sold my fucking soul. Such as my man and how to please him! Such as making wonderful dinners for my man! Such as looking pretty for my man! And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal! Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because... Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway. Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are! Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around. Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else? No. I don't want your work to be cruddy. How's work? I'll make it. I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right? Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink. Voila! You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong? Oh! I didn't see you there, sneaky boy! You're like a boy sneaking in... Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby! I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl! Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis. Really? I'm trying, you know. I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want. Do you like my new look? Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different. It would just be helpful to know. Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know. Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot. Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk. So, how's it going today? I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men. You are an animal. I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God! I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this. Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch! I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to... It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry. Who from work? Who is it? Who is it? Nothing. Be right out. All right. You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan. I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here. Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan. Nathan, what the hell are you talking about? Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal. What? I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your... He looks perfectly fine. I think he's feral. Come on. No. Too... upright. Might've been a person. I don't know. Something. Did you see that? That's very funny. Absolutely. Yes. Yes, darling. Fifteen. Of course. Yes, darling. I don't think so. Why? It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds! Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow! Do you? Oh do you, darling? Do you? You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes. I'll be out in a minute. Nathan! Yeah But I have some peculiarities also. I like you, too, Nathan. You really enjoy my company? You do? No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas. Boy, this is good! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things. I'm sorry? Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish... It looks wonderful. We are animals after all. I'm not sure. Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan? What's the larger experiment? Paper or cloth? How's it going? I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan. You are a therapist, right? I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Where? You've got to respect that. They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug." Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.Tell him, Harold. Tell him, Harold. And? Harold! Tell the boy again. That is the wrong fork, young man. Harold, tell the boy. And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something. Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though. Yes... Derek. I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man. Wait!No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do. I like you so much, with or without hair. But don't spread that around. Bad for business. And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me. I'm going to miss you. With pleasure. Done! Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back. Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time. I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved. Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt. Nathan told my brother. Lila, I want to help you. Please, honey, let me in. Lila, it's Rosie. Stand on a stepladder sometimes. Yeah. My brother told me. Be still my crotch. Oh? Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor. Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear. No. I married a midget. Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill. Yeah? My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan. Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother. My brother says he likes you, too. So? Yeah, well my brother is his shrink. My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever. My brother is discreet. Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you. Loves animals. Loves you. Handsome, thirties, psychologist... I don't get that. Is that sexual? Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley. You still in the market for a real boy? Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt. Progress!
