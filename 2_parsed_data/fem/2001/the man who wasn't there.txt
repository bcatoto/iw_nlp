Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again. The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and-- A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told me . No one else. At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report. We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. Outside of Eugene, Ed. And you should tell Doris... Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you... Yes. Thank you. Hello, Ed.Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please-- It's OK... ...I wanted to make you happy. But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane... You're an enthusiast. I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are? I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though. ...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian. But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally. It doesn't matter, Mr Crane. But more or less. ...I stank, didn't I? Geez, Mr Crane. Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff. Oh, Mr Crane-- Boy. Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school. That's what he keeps telling me. Pop doesn't like people smoking in here. We've certainly missed you. We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry. Hello, Mr Crane. Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane. Hi, Mr Crane. Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow. He was deaf when he wrote this. I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear. It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright. I knew we'd pay for it. ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store. Should I... should I tell you why? I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them. I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that. ...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it. I don't know what's going on. I-- Honey. It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure. Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it. 'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful. ...What's so damn strange about that? That means I don't run Nirdlinger's! ...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex. Ahh... Dave. ...What a knucklehead. Oh, don't be a grump. Come on, get ready. It's important. Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push. Honey?...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy. I know who you are, Mr Crane. He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas. Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
