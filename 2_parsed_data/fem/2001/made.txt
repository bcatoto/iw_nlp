You sure? I just made it. He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee? Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here. You're Bobby, right?Somebody's getting comfortable. What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare. We're in Fashion. No. Manhattan. Come on. Let's go. Oh no. What is it this time. But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need. He's alright. I don't know. Do whatever you want. He's okay. Holy shit.I love you. Come home. Can you take me to Color Me Mine? No. I don't know. Uncle Bobby? Hello. I want spaghettis. You're not my daddy. It's a poison arrow tree frog. He's not doing it. No. It's daytime. A elephant seal. Where's mommy? Ricky's not wearing one.We used to take baths together. I know. He's great, right. Is he great? Should I fuck him? Is he cute? I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me. Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room... I want to leave right now. I'm just warning you, I can't swim. Yeah. I want it. Where's the surprise? That's a good idea, maybe I will! Kinda. Yeah. We rep lines? You know? Fashion?I want you to take her with you. Take her. Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am. Goodbye, Bobby. I never promised you anything. Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again. Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is. With what? Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through. Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay. Shhh. He'll hear you. Ho's a good guy -- Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl. Yeah? You sure? Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months. Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me. You shouldn't. He likes you. Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself. The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too. I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him. Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on. She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready. Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late. Oh, please. They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor. Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money. Oh my god. What happened? The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered. Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride? Where were you?Bullshit. And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging? You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing. I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit. What the fuck was that about?
