They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet. Julie, that stuff probably saved his life. Most we've ever used is half a CC. Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with? Monkeybone? What? How do you get from here - to there ? Jesus, honey...he always joked about you curing him, but I never realized what you cured him from . When he first came in to the sleep lab? Who did this? Special occasion? Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over."4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet." I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's not Stu any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing. The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be. Five CC's. What's the maximum safe dose? Left-handed, he was funny . He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped. I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out. Switch hands. He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell. Yeah...before your time. Stu. That was right about the time we met. I don't know. I guess it was... Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food... Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to - What'll it do if they pull the plug? I don't want to stop the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to scare him awake . No. I want to give him more . I want to give him a massive dose. He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is? He called me "Doc." But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring... It looks so... new . You're wearing a topcoat , Stu. - Where are your pants? Baby, don't lie. I know you went out. Stu? Is that you? Where did you go ? What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising! I had to park two blocks away. Is something - They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times. I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay? Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone - You sure this is...medically advisable? What are you watching? You're acting kind of...odd. Stu, are you...feeling okay? Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back. Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back. What's the matter? Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming. It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER. Stu? I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky. I don't think so. <i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy! What's the "bad" part? Stu - stop it. That monkey is good luck . You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it! Who? Can't you give it to me later? It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there... You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you! Kimmy! What's the matter? It's too soon even to - talk about that! Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a - The ring... I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine. When'd you get in?I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months. Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it - Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last? But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right? Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances? This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order. Give me a date, Doctor. Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a long time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out. Grandmama's ring. The engagement ring. He asked me to send it to him - I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring. An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like this . I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay? Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...Go. Just go . I'll worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO. You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy. Don't ask where I got it. You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her. I'm so sorry, Stu. I wanted to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you. Hypnos? Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
