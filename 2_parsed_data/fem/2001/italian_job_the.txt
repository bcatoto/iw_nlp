Hello? Daddy. How are you? Really? Does it smell nice? Does it come with a receipt? Why not bring it by yourself? We  could have dinner. Let me guess. Checking out the  birthplace of Christopher Columbus. With your parole officer's approval. What are you into, Dad? Don't break  my heart. You told me you were  through. You promised me. Daddy, don't do  this. Buzz of the fluorescents throws me  off. She's all yours. Now you know who to call first. Well I do it for the money. I'll  send you the bill. I never look. Bye, guys. Four minutes, forty-three seconds. So what's on the line-up? Tell him if I don't have it opened  in six minutes flat, breakfast is on  me. Charlie Croker. Refresh my memory. After you came to  see me and told me what happened to  my father, I told you I never wanted  to see you again, didn't I? So I'm a little confused. I don't want to know. When I was little he would play poker  at the house and drop quarters under  the table for me to find. You ever heard the expression, cut  to the chase? Precious or not, I don't deal with  ill-gotten goods. And you think that's me? Haven't you  heard that I work for the other side? I'm not a safecracker. I'm a  professional safe and vault  technician. Our chance? Who do you think you are  coming in here? Stealing the gold  isn't going to bring my father back  to life. Then get out. I see... If they don't undress you with their  eyes? Your fly. What are you doing here? I don't think so. No, you need to listen. I want you  to leave. Got it? You -- I don't believe this. You  paid someone to spill that drink? You truly are a fatuous, odious man. Well maybe you'll understand this.  Hit the road, Jack -- Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause  I'll kick you in the nuts so hard  that your voice will be as high as  my heels. I'll let you in on a secret. You  can't have a relationship with a  pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind  of thief. Fine. Richard. Charlie. Charlie was  just saying goodbye. I'm in this for one thing, Charlie,  and one thing only. I want to see  the look on his face when his gold  is gone. He took my father from me,  I'm taking this; it's the best I can  do. Don't worry. Jack Daniels never let  me down. Jack Daniels was chief engineer of  the Mini. And I drive it exactly the  way it was meant to be driven. We're going in circles. Who's tailing  you this week? Where are they? And what about you? I'll have it open in five minutes  flat. You get me to the safe, I'll open  it. If you're all dead, I guess I'm the  man for the job. In for a penny, in for a pound. Fine. I'm fine. Neurotic and Emotional. It's okay. I'm used to running into  all sorts of dogs on my job. Becky. You want to show me the problem? I'd like to check the cable modem  first. There we go. Now onto the TVs. Turn it on and see. Then it looks like you're all set. I don't think so. Sign here, please. Date. Oh, no. I meant that I need you to  put the date by your signature. It's  the 26th. I don't think that'd be a very good  idea. No, it's my rule. I don't accept  dates from men I've just met. I've  only known you five minutes. He touched my hand. And he came-on  to me. That slimy, disgusting man  came onto me and I had to pretend  that I liked it. You do know what this means... I've  created our window of opportunity. How wide is the hallway? Jack Daniels, straight up. We could rumble right up the front  steps, bring the getaway car right  to the vault, and then straight to  Union Station. By who? And what will you do when you find  this piece of shit who killed your  cousin? Okay. But now we should stop talking  Ukrainian, it's rude to my girl. Hungry. Then eat your Frosted Flakes. They're grrrreat! Such a perfect girl. Don't let their size fool you. These  were rally cars back in the day. 135  mph, 155 horsepower -- Let's put it this way: I can only  get insurance through companies that  advertise on TV at 3:00 in the  morning. You want the safe cracked, don't  you? Then I have to have perfect nails. I just let you in on a valuable trade  secret. Loud and clear. I know. I've got a date tonight. You really make laugh. Not tonight. I don't want to be out  late. Let's just say I've made some wrong  calls in the past. I like to take  things slow, cautious. Next time... I trust everyone. It's the devil  inside them that I don't trust. What? Who was that? Ow. I don't remember. You're hurting  me. Let go of my wrist. What is wrong  with you? It's just a saying. Once the charter's in the air, he  could change the flight path to  anywhere. And good-bye gold. This is Christina Griego with your  drive-home traffic report on KNX.  I'm looking down on Hollywood  Boulevard and this is definitely a  CIG alert. According to the police, the computers  at the Traffic Control Center are  down. I've seen earthquakes, mudslides,  fires, riots, but this... Let me try  to paint a picture for our listeners. There's been some kind of an explosion  and a Brink's truck has just dropped  down into the Metro Rail Blue Line. Shhh... You know when you said this wouldn't  be the same as opening a safe for  the cops? Did you have to be right? I never look. Away. The farther the better. It is now. We sure did. It has been a hectic day. That thing? Oh... That thing. Yeah. I do. Now that's an entirely different  question.
