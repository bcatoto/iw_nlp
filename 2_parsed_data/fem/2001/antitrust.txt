Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him. It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case. I can paint anywhere. You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool. "Make" him? You are a fanatic. Is it over? You're just afraid to eat it. It's gonna get cold. Here we go. Oh, right. Hold on. Milo? I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now. Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss. Look at me! I'm gonna change. Just shut up? Are you gonna tell me where you went? Milo, you -- Milo -- He has thousands of employees, Milo -- What? Where were you? You know you can't keep anything from me. That was -- different. Poor baby. You know that's not true. Guilt? I remember. ...Why? Nothing? It's almost nine, I've been so worried! What did you see in there? ...Whaddo I do? Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed? You can't just walk in, either. Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post? And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards -- Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and -- Milo. Why would he -- "Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about. You're scaring me. I think we should just go. They hack into people's programs? I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that. Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case. It was a hate crime. Teddy was killed last night. I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much -- What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it. If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor. He's your boss. He's not your -- What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it? That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything from me. Milo! What about --? We're not gonna let it. Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him? Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die? No way. You have this -- destiny. Didn't you visit the campus? I think that's great, Milo. I do. But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high? Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad. It's important. Then you've gotta ask him about that. C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times. I don't think he knows how. He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clichï¿½ about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt. Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes. Prick. Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something. He'll tell me when he gets home. No.Latitude 47 degrees. What? Maybe it's the satellite. But you said the other -- It's three years old, it -- Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?! Please don't go. Why?! Does he know you know? You'll come up with something. You could always say you have to go the bathroom. Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described. Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it? Yeah, that's old, in a tree. He doesn't know about the Day Care. Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts. The dishes are juiced up, too. Gary. What'd he say? 'Cause their apartments might be bugged? Oh. I liked you. I was checking you out. I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally? And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished. You mean -- break in? Before they kill somebody else, too. It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work. But they'd still get the idea, right? A what? He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this -- mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it. How close are you? Time? But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like -- What about "60 Minutes." We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home. The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine. There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein. Who can we trust? What about the FBI? I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean. ...Milo? He's out of prison? Is that my -- scenario? Tell me. Oh yeah? But why would they --? The Day Care? Why would you do a thing like -- That's great. I -- didn't know. Then and now. But not right now. Long story. Not that interesting. Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people. Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway. Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower. They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going? Did you wanna be alone? Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to -- Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you. No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work. ...Something like that. Yeah. We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers. I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets. You're famous around here. You know my name.
