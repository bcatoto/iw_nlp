Knowing everywhere in the world,  this is the software people use. 20 years ago, Gary had an idea, that's  all he had. And now the company's  bigger than IBM. Is it over? You are a fanatic. "Make" him? You know what he's like. He just  wants to work on stuff that's cool. I can paint anywhere. I'd like to stay here, yeah. And I  kind of think he should be with Teddy. I mean, nobody else can follow what  they're talking about half the time. Maybe you shouldn't push it so hard.  About Outpost. No offense, you sound  insane. Anything? That's not even credible.  If he wants to go up there? To check  it out? I think you should encourage  him. It's his life. But everybody's  treating him like this -- valuable   object. You're hurting your own case. But how does he know that's what you  guys're working on? C'mon, how often do you talk to  somebody who's been on the cover of  Time. Three of four times. Then you've gotta ask him about that. It's important. Bully? Are we talking about Gary  Boyd? Or your dad. But he's not quite the same guy  anymore. Don't get your hopes too  high? I think that's great, Milo. I do. Didn't you visit the campus? No way. You have this -- destiny. Don't bring that up. Like a different  girlfriend would'd've let you die? It's not just Gary that makes you  wanna go there? 'Cause it's a big  place. You might not even see him  again. Prob'ly waiting by the phone for  Outpost to call. We'll leave it for  him? 'Give you guys some time alone. Milo, this is Mr. Barton from the  Justice Department. Sorry about the glass. We're not gonna let it. -- ingested the fatal mixture of  sedatives crushed in apple sauce.  According to the cult's eerily  professional website, it was "time  to move on..." Get out while you can, dude! The guy who was at Gary's house? ...The corporate condos were as  romantic as they sound. Milo! What about --? Milo? You know my name. You're famous around here. I wouldn't worry about it. You've  gotta figure most people around here  were their teachers' pets. We moved around so much I barely  knew my teachers. ...Something like that. Yeah. No, I know what you mean. I used to  spend my life wishing people could  be like computers. Least they make  sense. Sometimes you think they've  betrayed you. Like a person would.  But then you see, no, you just missed  a step. You can go back and make it  all work. Graphical interfaces. For Skywire?  I'm s'posed to coordinate with you. Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms,  ranging from the narrowest bandwidth  to -- Have a seat. He's with someone, but  I know he wants to see you. Go on in. He's always happy to see you. This feels fairly grown up, I'd say. That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything  from me. What would it mean, anyway? If he  didn't write it? Milo! He's your boss. He's not your -- If you can't deal with him on that  basis, you better get a new counselor. What's extreme is what that ER doctor  said when he pumped your stomach.  Eat another sesame seed and that's  it. I mean, if one little comment from  Gary is gonna upset you this much -- C'mon. Let's do the toast? Did you wanna be alone? They just pushed up the schedule on  Skywire apps. How fast are you going? Mine's not the CEO. He barely  remembers to take a shower. Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway. Mmm-more like -- I have a little  trouble. Trusting people. Long story. Not that interesting. Then and now. But not right now. That's great. I -- didn't know. Teddy was killed last night. It was a hate crime. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Nelson? Your mom wants you. It's  time to go to scatter the ashes. We gotta go too, honey. You okay? You okay? I miss him, too. Milo? You okay? Are you saying you think they had  something to do with his death? Nelson  said it was an airtight case. I can't see Outpost putting its  reputation in the hands of people  like that. They hack into people's programs? You're scaring me. I think we should  just go. "Like this?" It's Gary you're talking  about. Milo. Why would he -- Even if all this were true. There're  20 other buildings. All of them filled  with computers and -- Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents  are all over the place. How could  they hope to hide a surveillance  post? And how can you get in there, anyway?  With the cameras and the swipe cards -- You can't just walk in, either. Is it two? Or is it three? Have you  ever really noticed? ...Whaddo I do? Just tell me what to do. No. He'll tell me when he gets home. Instead of busting my chops you should  do something about that girl. Fire  her. Or something. Prick. It's almost nine, I've been so  worried! What did you see in there? Nothing? ...Why? I remember. Guilt? Poor baby. You know that's not true. I was so worried about you. That was -- different. You didn't feel it? So intense. So you're not avoiding me. What's wrong? Why would you do a thing like -- The Day Care? But why would they --? I'm sorry, Milo... I'm sorry. Oh yeah? So that's in my -- file? Is that my -- scenario? Tell me. He's out of prison? No. ...Milo? I always felt if a -- boy I liked  ever found out -- he'd run. He'd  think I was unclean. He said it made sense that Gary's  code was like Teddy's, that that  clichï¿½ about great minds was true.  Said it was all about his own guilt. Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary  mixed-up with his dad once in a while.  It always passes. I don't think he knows how. What about the FBI? Who can we trust? How do you let go of a secret without  telling the wrong person. There're so many disinformation sites  about Gary already. Where he has  devil's horns or they crop him in  with Saddam Hussein. The mainstream media. TV, or a  newsmagazine. We could cross-reference a data base  on media ownership. But not on our  own computers. Not even at home. What about "60 Minutes." But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't  love to break something like -- Time? Milo? How close are you? He's got 12 satellites up. He's got  dishes on top of 21. He's building  this -- mega-network for Skywire. Let's use  it. A what? But they'd still get the idea, right? It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a  concept, it's maybe three day's work. Before they kill somebody else, too. You mean -- break in? And what if the broadcast dishes on  top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said  the place isn't finished. I'll go look. They'll just have a few more pictures  of me snooping around. I thought the worst they would do is  fire me. Who knew they took  termination so literally? Oh. I liked you. I was checking you out. 'Cause their apartments might be  bugged? What'd he say? Gary. Where were you? You know you can't keep anything  from me. I won't turn you in. What? He has thousands of employees, Milo -- Milo -- Milo, you -- None of us knows how to use it. I'm  thinking of taking a course. May I? Forget it. I needed t'see it up close for a  graphic. The outpost with a dish on  top? I climbed up there to get it  right. The dishes are juiced up, too. Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke  into #21. I was in his office when  he was reviewing the card readouts. He doesn't know about the Day Care. Yeah, that's old, in a tree. Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody  entered the Day Care at four A.M.?  And tells them about it? "Sorry about the late notice?" One window'll be obits I downloaded,  based on the scenarios you described.  The other windows'll accommodate the  surveillance stuff you told me about.  The idea is, this works with anything,  since we can't edit. Same with the excerpts I'm choosing:  they'll play against any of the images  you described. You could always say you have to go  the bathroom. You'll come up with something. They called the house to ask who's  your favorite painter. I hate being the Hollywood guy. It's  so limiting. Meet my friend, Ricky. He's a sweetheart. He gave 10,000  PC's to the Library Association. And so what?! And so what? The merchandising implications are  epic. A kid's watching the movie, he  points and clicks at the laser blaster --  before the reel's even over he's  ordered the toy. But, I mean -- Devil's Advocate --  won't that influence the content?  Won't the artists complain? The  directors or writers or whoever? Artists? Darling, the only art left  in America is business. You're in  Picasso's house! The irreverence! Are you gonna tell me where you went? Are you having an affair, Milo? Just shut up? Does he know you know? Why?! Please don't go. Here's the interface. I'm a mess! I got this Hunan cookbook,  since we're always afraid for you to  eat in Chinese restaurants. I've  been mincing things into teeny-tiny  pieces all afternoon. Look at me! I'm gonna change. Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss. I know you. You're gonna run back to  work right after dinner. I want my  kiss now. Be right back. Milo? Milo? Oh, right. Hold on. Here we go. It's gonna get cold. You're just afraid to eat it. Milo, hi! How was the party? Wanna get a cheeseburger or something? Tell me you're not calling on your  car phone?! It's three years old, it -- But you said the other -- Longitude 77 degrees, 03 minutes, 58  seconds East. Latitude 38 degrees, 55 minutes, 14  seconds South. Maybe it's the satellite. They're already here. My laptop must  be wired! You checked your connections? What? Latitude 47 degrees. Longitude 66. Come now. They've got guns! Oh my God. Milo? Who's got Skywire? Lyle? Phone for you.
