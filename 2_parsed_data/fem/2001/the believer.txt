You don't own this place. Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I... Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat. Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have? He commands it whether He exists or not... Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit. No. What are you looking for? I don't know. I just want to try it. Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews. Lina, come here! I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff... Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like... Okay... Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish. 'Cause he wasn't a rabbi. Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly? Do they? It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews. Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter. I told you, I'm good at this. Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God.... The book's closed. You think I should just because there's no reason? Why should I submit? Fuck that. And belief follows? What's it about? Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing. V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing? Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem... With you there's a tragic dimension. The sex is better. Where are they? It looks a little like a swastika. Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles? What assholes. That's stupid. Why not? I'm good at languages. Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay? I want to learn to read it. What's it mean? Oh, yeah... 'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here... But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right? Do you know it like that? By heart. How come there's no punctuation? Where'd you get this? No. He's at a home out here. You can't. I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda? Who's Linda? Bigger and better. Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now. I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one. You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends. That's stupid. Why would they? Killing himself. I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that. He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on. They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met. "And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..." Why no silencer? Where'd you read all that stuff? You're not in school? What do you do? Which is what? Disease? What disease? Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio? Nobody reads that stuff anymore.That's a much easier game. I doubt it. How did you find out? Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes. I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were. Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...? What is happening? Hello...? We want to talk to you about something.... We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement. How have things been going? Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish. Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city. Do you feel you're making progress here? So what Jew would you kill first? Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us. Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency? What part of Germany are you people from? Balint? Lina Moebius. And you are...?You can heat them up and eat with him. Do you know them? I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and -- The Polacks? From Sacred Heart? Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up? Tell it to Hitler. Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people... Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure? He's going to die. He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around. I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble. What are you doing here?You shut up. Who do you think you are? Danny, I'm trying to -- save you. Think about your father. Your sister. And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it. All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them.... So are you... But they'll believe you.... Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house. Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me? It was a nine millimeter. You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use? Which <i>Times</i> guy? I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants. Tell me about Lina Moebius. This is me. You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God. You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa. Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking. I thought you hated Torah. Why did you come tonight? To see me? The arguments, anyway.We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already. He's Jewish? Manzetti? It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been. Did you see how they reacted to him? Danny, please, we don't want to know. Are you out of your mind?! Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay? What? I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they? So what? Do you have a suit? Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too. And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you? Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us? We think you'd be good at it. We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising. Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now. Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things? I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree? None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
