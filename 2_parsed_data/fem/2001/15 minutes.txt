I don't want to drag you down with me. Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own. Pouring it out! I'll get my clothes. In the kitchen. Right. No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you. If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away. Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous? I'm sorry. Are you alright? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over. All this time. Hiding. Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was. Never trusting anyone... You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison? I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore. What are you asking me? I came here. I had no money. I knew no one. I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money. I considered it, but... it's not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig's. No. No. Yes, I considered it. So...the station is empty? Somewhere else? Do you live alone? I've been in these clothes since...the killings. Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody? Are you married? I will if they don't send me back. Now I become custody of police department? Yes, but he was a cop. ...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him. You're a cop - you'll never believe me. I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled. No, no, don't talk to Immigration! If I tell you, will you arrest me? Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs. I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse! Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time. Look. Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good. You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her. Now why don't you pay me? That's confidential. Could you put the money on the dresser? It's an outcall service run out of an apartment. I don't meet the other girls. Aren't you gonna get undressed? Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure. Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser. Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl. Hi, I'm Honey.You want the tape? There it is! Trust me, you'll want to take this call. You've got a call. Robert...?Thank you. Okay. Okay. And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing. You promise? Okay, til tonight. I love you. Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me. Promise? No. No, listen to me here. I want to know what you're talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and... Okay. That is great. But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here. Yeah. Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They want me to anchor tonight! Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for a second. They only call me when it's an emergency. Just hold that thought. Can you call back? No. Tell me what you want to say. Don't worry about the damn phone. I won't answer it. Jesus. And last week you came over with blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you? Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it? You're not so bad yourself. Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh? That was good. You were holding the evidence. Yes you are. I'm not just some reporter. I don't just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me something. Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me. Stop it. You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues. You could give me something. What is your problem? Why'd you snap at me? I just wanted a statement. Hey, honey. Okay. Alright. Alright. Eddie, are you okay? Alright, cut, cut, cut. Do you have the suspect in custody? Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct? I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department? Detective - can you tell us what happened here? Is it drug related? Can we go up to the crime scene? How many victims are up there? Detective, does it look like a murder? Oh my G-d. We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him. I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!! Alright. Go ahead. I want to hear everything he said. What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison. Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build. And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me. He said he was her cousin. I told him where she works. They were just here. Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too. Boy, she's so popular all the sudden. No. Yeah. He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...? Poor girl... Oh my G-d. Honey! Honey's dead? What's wrong? I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney... Who's there?
