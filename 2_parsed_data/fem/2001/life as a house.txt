Who are all these people? I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh. And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying. I'm going to bed. Uh...using Josh like that. I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not. What are you doing up so early? You'd better call and cancel. And why was the alarm on? What's wrong? Mom? I don't know... More like when I kissed Sam. It's not what I was expecting. My mother would die. Did you feel anything? I want you to try something with me, okay? I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson. He wouldn't use around me. I don't like any of it. He's not gay. I found out purely by accident, believe me. I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided. What's that? Monday. Nope. Is that legal? Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage? Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys. I hate nose rings. And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working. No. He seems lonely. Sorry I got you into trouble. What? Where are you?! He asked where you were! He wants you with him. Not if what he left me was real. If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant. What? Are you afraid of heights? Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay? No, I don't...NO. I thought we were just friends. I thought I was helping you. Not really. I was wondering. Josh said... Are you sure you're totally into guys? Does everything have to have a point? It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way. Why are you so uptight? We're not gonna do anything. I'm coming in. I've seen lots of people. It's not a big thing for me. This is serious! I don't have my license. He was my ride. He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars. His parents took his car. They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer. I'm okay. Huh? Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride? Maybe see a movie? Turn over. I wanted him to marry her. Your dad dated my mom after her divorce. Do you remember me from when you lived here? I'll get your back. Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom. You look better without make-up. Tell him I said "hi". Where's your dad? You should stay. Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you. Your dad's really gonna build his house? Where to? What are you doing here? Hi. No. He won't leave my room. If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry. I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him. Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day. He's got a standing invitation. He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered. Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop. I wouldn't want you as a friend. I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends? Listen to music? Masturbate together? Talk on the phone? Are you guys' friends? It could have been a squirt gun. IPO's caused the rat population on this street. This is such a street of whiners.Atonement. I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom. Has he eaten anything at all? Why? What do you mean? I couldn't sleep last night. Oh God, we don't want the police! Oh...I set it to see if it would work. I couldn't get it to go down. I put him to work. Here, honey! It's midnight. What's the matter, Sam? You're here early today. If she's not up, you can use my shower. Come over anytime you need to, Sam. I want you both to stay. Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there. I didn't recognize you! Sam? She didn't really say. She's out with a friend. Where are you? You're driving me crazy, waiting like this. I want you in me now! And you thought they might be under her dress? I did warn you. You'll have to explain that to the police. George, this is the third time. Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter? This has got to stop!No. A friend... your mother? Everybody gets touched by someone they love. I'm sorry, I don't know what that was. Good for you. Can you build a house in four months? No one's really said four months is all you have, have they? What kind of house? What would you do? I'd eat a lot of red meat.It's so beautiful. He's here. Check the bathroom. I guess it depends on what you give up on. Home after. Will you come in and say "hi"? Since seventh grade. I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep. Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years. Oh, honey. There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work. You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming. I thought I might stop by. Will he talk to me? He's not the type to worry. Well, he doesn't need to worry. He's at work while I'm here. Why is that? You're so nice to let Sam use your shower. I better get the kids home. Don't move! Are you going to kiss me? I could die. Back. Neck. Back. 'I'll be in the bedroom.' No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in love with George?' Peter left me yesterday. I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me. Is your back still killing you? I need to know. If I weren't married? I'm married. It sounded like a pick-up line. You've never said that before. That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known. What was that? When I picked you up from the train station...what you said. Nothing is going on with us, is it? I thought we were helping. Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us? She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing! What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there! He's not there! And when he is, he isn't! So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George. I'll stop coming. But it won't be because of Peter. It'll be because you asked me to stop. Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it. What is it with this? They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here! He has no time! I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George. No. Why? I like to be with Sam. Let's see if you've gotten any better. I smiled at him. This was my very first slow dance. Do you need help? Or wound. Let them keep their eyes and fingers. I kind of said that maybe they could do something. Help. I'm sorry. They really wanted to come. I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me. I don't think they'll be too much trouble. Where's Sam? Do you need anything? I'll go to the pharmacy. I have some Demerol at home. I thought you'd be up with the sun. You're not well. I've been wrong a lot in my life. The antibiotics weren't working. It's what I believe, George. My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him. That wasn't a dream. That was Sam. It was perfect, George. Amazing. It was so real. I dreamed about your house last night. I'm fine. Nothing. I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow. We have it on video! Was that when? My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that. Do you remember? What have you been before today? Sam's favorite. The first and the last. I was here six years. And I only hated two. I used to live here. It makes me sad. Well, for later then. George -- I did say he could go. No. I was going to let you do that. Last time you were gone for a week! I drove over and you were gone. What was I supposed to do? When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working. I'm married. No, you don't. Trust me. Forget it, really. I'll survive. One of you would end up dead. Thank you for at least sounding sincere. You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer? He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore. Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day. Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it. Where will you live? How many years did I live with your beams and boards? First in the garage, then in the living room. We're going to do it, Robin. Next year. Next year. Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire... Money? You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it. Why call me? Why would they tow your truck? But you can't call me while you think? What did you do with your dog? Where have you been for a week?! You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?! What? You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion! I called everyone, everywhere! You just vanished! You could be dead! Because he put the lock on! Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!? I don't know anything, anymore! He never answers. What are you doing? Where he always is. Lock the door behind you. Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend? Ring the bell before you try the door. I feel in love with George again. I hardly recognize you with a beard. Sam took them to a movie. That's the problem. Despite you. You never really trusted me. What are you doing home? I know. Sam is working at something for the first time in his life. Once in a while he even talks to me. I want to be around for that. We haven't been away together for three years. What difference does a few months make? I can't go right now. I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks. Sam's working. I told you Sam was working. I mean, he really is. I'm helping George build his house. After the kids are back in school. I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall. The biggest waste of time since television. To shave your chest? What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you? It would worry me. Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you? I'll make you something. We've eaten. A man he respects. I don't have a clue anymore. I wish you'd talk to him. He needs a man. I read the letter. You read the will. He wants you to keep it. To live in it some day. You could keep it and rent it out? You're sure about this? I don't know what I'm doing. Can you stay for dinner? I didn't go in your room. In the bedroom. Go tell your father we're eating. Nothing R, okay? Would you stop being ridiculous? Your father wants Sam home as much as I do. Adam, that's not true! I brought a few of my own. Ryan, would you rather swim or work? Not all day. I'll be home after lunch. I just thought it would be nice. What did you say? He'll be gone for his birthday. Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
