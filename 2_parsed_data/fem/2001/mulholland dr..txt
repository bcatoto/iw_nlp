Right. See ya. Thanks Coco. I'll let you know. Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind. Sorry to trouble you, Coco. You're really something Coco...thank you. Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town. Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together. It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ... I was afraid of that. Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much. Wow! It's unbelievable! I can hardly wait, Coco. No, I don't. I guess I've come to quite a place. Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that. I... Well, I ... Yes, he is. He raises corn. Hi...do you work with my Aunt? Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked. Are you okay? I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry. Are you all right? I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming. No, no, I'm fine. Hi. Very pleased to meet you. Yes. Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before... I can call them... I can call my dad. You're still here? Betty. What? Was anyone hurt? Can you tell me what happened? Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive. Well ... we'll leave her a note. But it said #12. Diane? Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet. No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be. Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money. I know what you have to do, but let me do it. Rita... I know what you're doing. C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door. Keep going. Go around to the back. Do you know them?! What is it? What do you see?! You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble. Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you! When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go. I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich! You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn. Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one? "Before I kill you." "Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..." "Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... " "You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work." "I can call them... I can call my dad... " "My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..." "You're still here?" I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out. What's wrong with that? Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are. Call the number. Strange to be calling yourself. We'll take our check. Not that I can see. Come on... let's find you something to wear. Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive. We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident. Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call. Mulholland Drive? When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything? The money. You don't know where it came from? You don't remember anything else? How do you remember how to talk? Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything? Well... what do you think about then? I mean... well what do you think about? What do you mean? You're Rita. What's wrong? What is it Rita? All right, but...I'm going to check on you. If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep. But, this could be serious. Oh... She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that. I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel. I...I mean......I...it's none of my business. Thank you... thank you very much. Betty Elms. Yes, Sir. No, we don't. Wally Brown. To my audition.Good luck, honey! Get going. You don't want to be late. Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that. His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever. It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong? Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it. So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her. Sweetie, look at me straight. She wants to know who's staying in her apartment. Your Aunt called me. You got it! See you later honey. Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler. Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there. I told ya. That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one. Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it. Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another. You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class. You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass." Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too. I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.Okay, but you don't know what you're missing. I'm just offering a place to stay. I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place. Will you meet with him? Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be. It's been a very strange day. Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away. Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea. Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy? I know, but you're broke. Where are you? You're broke! Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls. I know. Where are you Adam? Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do. Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam! You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this. Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam! They fired everyone. They've closed the set. They sent everybody home. Adam, where are you?My name is Rita. I think so. I was just taking a shower. A car ... a car accident. There was an accident. I came here. That's okay.Sure. No... No. I haven't seen any. No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one. Not here...no thanks.I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff. I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right. Number 17. Yes?It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new. But I want to. What ... I..HAVE... to do. No. I don't think... No... but... Those men in front, in the car. Don't stop! But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble. Okay. Good luck! Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here? I'm all right. "Then they'd put you in jail." "Before what?" "What about you? What will your dad think about you?" "You know what I want...it's not that difficult." "But you won't..." "So... surprise"... "Really?" "I came back. I thought that's what you wanted." I'm not sure about this. Maybe...maybe ... maybe. It's not my voice ... but I know her. Maybe it's not me. No. Just the coffee. There's nothing? Okay. Okay... but just...just to see. No.... I don't... That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive. Mulholland Drive. Unh, unh. No There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it. There are things there.... but I'm... here. I don't know. Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it. What do you mean? I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!! I don't know who I am. I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ... It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep. No...I need to sleep. No. I think I've been hurt. She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think. No ..........I.
