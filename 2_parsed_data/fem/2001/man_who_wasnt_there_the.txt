Ed was 4F on account of his fallen  arches. Watch your card, honey. Jesus, bingo--BINGO! Honey? Shave my legs, will ya? Gimme a drag. ...Love ya, honey. Ed? ...Gimme a zip. Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I  told you last week, for the Christmas  Push. Come on, get ready. It's important. Oh, don't be a grump. Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig  van Beethoven. He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas. I know who you are, Mr Crane. ...My father used to take me with  him when he got his hair cut. Walter  Abundas? ...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls  me Birdy. ...What a knucklehead. Dave. Ahh... ...Money problems. He's thinking  about canceling the Annex. *That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!* ...What a knucklehead. ...I hate wops. ...What's so damn strange about that? ...*You* didn't have to grow up with  'em. ...Family. Boy. How you doin', Doris, you been OK? How're you, Constanza? Oh, you know, I got my healt'. And  how you been, uh... Ed. How's a business? He's a barber, right? It's a good  trade. So how come you got no kids? 'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn  wonderful. Life is so goddamn wonderful, you  almost won't believe it. It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries,  I'm sure. Congratulations on your goddamn  cherries! ...Leggo my goddamn elbow. Honey. I don't know what's going on. I-- ...I don't know what happened to Big  Dave. I know some of it.  Irregularities in my books, they  said. Can I explain it. I helped him cook the books, Ed. I  did do that. I know all about that. But I don't  know how much to tell them. Should I... should I tell you why? Jesus Christ. ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone  could open them up, make sense of  the whole goddamn store. I knew we'd pay for it. Hello, Ed. ...No, No, it's very late. Yes. Thank you. Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came  to tell you... And you should tell Doris... ...You know how Big Dave loved  camping. And the out-of-doors. We went camping last summer. In  Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene,  Ed. At night, there were lights--we both  saw them. We never told anyone,  outside of our official report. A spacecraft. I saw the creatures.  They led Big Dave onto the craft. He  never told anyone what they did,  outside of his report. Of course he  told *me*. No one else. The government knows. I cannot repeat  it to you. But this thing goes deep,  Ed. This was not your wife. I goes  deep, and involves the government.  There is a great deal of fear. You  know how certain circles would find  it--the knowledge--a threat. They  try to limit it, and-- Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed.  After this happened, things changed.  Big Dave... he never touched me again. ...Tell Doris not to worry. I know  it wasn't her. Perhaps this will  bring it out, finally. Perhaps now  it will all come out. But it's true. What a dope. Giff me your hant. What're *you* selling? Get lost. Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
