(crying) This cage is too small. Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope) Well, I've got a talking donkey. Oh, go ahead, little fella. Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little  nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox.  Talk, you boneheaded dolt... No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends  to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to  talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing  you ever saw. No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! He can fly! Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed  and he...signed an eviction notice. The chair! Give him the chair! Oh! Oh! What? I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to  rescue me. But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our  first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful,  romantic moment? Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should  sweep me off my feet out yonder window  and down a rope onto your valiant steed. (smiles) Mm-hmm. But we have to savor this moment! You  could recite an epic poem for me. A  ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something! Can I at least know the name of my champion? Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds  out a handkerchief) I pray that you  take this favor as a token of my gratitude. (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon? But this isn't right! You were meant  to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying.  That's what all the other knights did. That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly  stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek  ignores her and heads for a wooden door  off to the side.) Wait. Where are you  going? The exit's over there. What kind of knight are you? It talks! (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You  did it! You rescued me! You're amazing.  (behind her Donkey falls down the hill)  You're - - You're wonderful. You're...  (turns and sees Shrek fall down the  hill and bump into Donkey) a little  unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed  is great, and thy heart is pure. I am  eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears  his throat.) And where would a brave  knight be without his noble steed? The battle is won. You may remove your  helmet, good Sir Knight. Why not? Please. I would'st look upon the face  of my rescuer. But how will you kiss me? No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know  how it goes. A princess locked in a  tower and beset by a dragon is rescued  by a brave knight, and then they share  true love's first kiss. Well, yes. What is so funny? Just take off the helmet. Take it off. Now! You- - You're a- - an ogre. Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is  all wrong. You're not supposed to be  an ogre. Then why didn't he come rescue me? But I have to be rescued by my true  love, not by some ogre and his- - his  pet. I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.  You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he  wants to rescue me properly, I'll be  waiting for him right here. You wouldn't dare. Put me down! Put me down, or you will suffer the  consequences! This is not dignified!  Put me down! You just tell her she's not your true  love. Everyone knows what happens when  you find your...(Shrek drops her on  the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to  DuLoc the better. And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?  What's he like? (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow?  It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop  to make camp? But there's robbers in the woods. I need to find somewhere to camp now! No, no, it's perfect. It just needs  a few homey touches. A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee  good night. (goes into the cave and  puts the bark door up behind her) (os) I said good night! Good morning. Hm, how do you like your  eggs? You know, we kind of got off to a bad  start yesterday. I wanted to make it  up to you. I mean, after all, you did  rescue me. Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead  of us. (walks off) Thanks. Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people  before you get to know them. (to Robin Hood) What are you doing? (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't  know who you think you are! Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo. He takes a wee percentage, What a guy, Monsieur Hood. What he's basically saying is he likes  to get... That's bad. He's mad, he's really, really mad. Man, that was annoying! Uh, shall we? What? Well...(laughs) when one lives alone,  uh, one has to learn these things in  case there's a...(gasps and points)  there's an arrow in your butt! Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so  sorry. Shrek's hurt. Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help  Shrek, run into the woods and find me  a blue flower with red thorns. (like it's obvious) For getting rid  of Donkey. Now you hold still, and I'll yank this  thing out. (gives the arrow a little  pull) I'm sorry, but it has to come out. Now, hold on. Don't move. Would you...(grunts as Shrek puts his  hand over her face to stop her from  getting at the arrow) Okay. What do  you propose we do? Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head.  (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just  about... That's DuLoc? Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried  about Donkey. I mean, look at him. He doesn't look  so good. (kneels to look him in the eyes) That's  what they always say, and then next  thing you know, you're on your back.  (pause) Dead. Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea. I'll get the firewood. Mmm. This is good. This is really good.  What is this? No kidding. Well, this is delicious. I guess I'll be dining a little differently  tomorrow night. (smiles) I'd like that. Yes, Shrek? (jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's  late. I-It's very late. Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified.  You know, I'd better go inside. Good night. Oh, no! Shh! No, it's okay. It's okay. Donkey, I'm the princess. It's me, in this body. Donkey! No! Shh. This is me. I'm ugly, okay? No. I - - I've been this way as long  as I can remember. It only happens when sun goes down.  "By night one way, by day another. This  shall be the norm... until you find  true love's first kiss... and then take  love's true form." It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little  girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every  night I become this. This horrible,  ugly beast! I was placed in a tower  to await the day my true love would  rescue me. That's why I have to marry  Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun  sets and he sees me like this. (begins  to cry) But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this  is not how a princess is meant to look. I have to. Only my true love's kiss  can break the spell. Shrek? (os) I can't just marry whoever I want.  Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean,  really, who can ever love a beast so  hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly"  don't go together. That's why I can't  stay here with Shrek. (os) My only chance to live happily  ever after is to marry my true love. Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how  it has to be. It's the only way to break  the spell. No! You can't breathe a word. No one  must ever know. Promise you won't tell. Promise! I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him,  I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly  runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek!  Shrek, there's something I want...(she  looks and sees the rising sun, and as  the sun crests the sky she turns back  into a human.) Shrek. Are you all right? I - - I don't - - There's something  I have to tell you. You heard what I said? I thought you'd understand. But I thought that wouldn't matter to  you. Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad  snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord,  for I was just saying a short... (Watches  as Farquaad is lifted off his horse  and set down in front of her. He comes  to her waist.) farewell. No, you're right. It doesn't. Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would  make - - No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get  married today before the sun sets. Fare-thee-well, ogre. (eyeing the setting sun) Um- Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead  to the "I do's"? Shrek? What are you doing here? Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little  late for that, so if you'll excuse me And why not? And what do you know about true love? Shrek, is this true? (looking at the setting sun) "By night  one way, by day another." (to Shrek)  I wanted to show you before. Shrek! No, let go of me! Shrek! No, Shrek! Yes, Shrek? Really? (smiles) I love you too. (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well,  yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed  to be beautiful.
