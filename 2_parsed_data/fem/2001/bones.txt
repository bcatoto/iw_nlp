In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something. Covered with blood. Mother! No. No we won't, Momma. I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us. I don't. Patrick doesn't. And his brother and sister don't. And they're in the house with him. Aren't you gonna do something about it? Who? But how do you know? Maybe he just wanted to see us? And now he's gone again. And you've all killed my father for the second time. But if it's him. If he's really come back, won't he know us? Love us? Who? Who is he? What is he? Who was he, Momma? He tried to kill us. You said bad things hurt places. So maybe good things heal them. Good things are happening here. Maybe for the first time ever. And maybe that's all it takes. All the more reason I should be here. You said the vision, the images. They're just that. Just pictures. They can't hurt you. That's what you always said. And what's that? Have you ever been inside? They seemed alright. Bring a little life to that old building. I'm sorry, Momma. Maybe next time. You mean as opposed to your life? I have to finish this for class. I can't! I can't find you. Patrick, he's... I'm here. Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in? No, I want to stay with you guys. But I can't. I mean I'm not ready. I can't. Not yet. He probably thinks he's saving you from something. I'm sure that's what my mother thinks. She doesn't want me here. With you. In this house. What? Oh yeah. Coming. If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door. Or the living fall in. Who knows. Yeah. But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears. Maybe. But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate. My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets. There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one. The city of the dead. Nothing. You'd think she was crazy. And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not. No. It goes way back. Or so my Momma says. That place is already bad luck. Guess it's not Rossmore Park. Thanks for the help. How do you know? Are they on the radio? You moved into this block?I don't. Your father was his best friend. He loved Jeremiah. So he must hate him the most of all now. He'll take his time. But even if it is too late. If your father is dead. It's not over. The door has to be closed. It's the only way. It's possible your father may not be dead yet. I know damn well she's there. Outta my way, boy. Cinnabar? I'm coming! Some holes can't be filled. Some hungers can't be satisfied. Don't feed that dog. But. Where are we, baby? What? Jimmy, you've got -- No? That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now? Kill us? Kill us all? I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here. No baby. I'm serious. Cancel that meeting. I got more fruit that needs checking. Come home with me now. Left hand's the past. Your right's the present. And the future. But it's not written in stone. It's written in flesh and blood. And flesh and blood will change. See? There's something here, a new line, right across your life line. My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her. Let me see your hand. Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck. My God. My dress. We have to find it. And burn it. And shut the door. Told you so. Alright. We tried. Let's go home. Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out. We'll have to sneak in. Fine. Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you. Like what? I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight. But no more than you do. We're not witches. I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it. Maybe we all do. Eddie Mack, that cop. And Jeremiah. And even when he's done, who knows. He won't be satisfied. Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more. Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied. He'll kill them. He'll kill every last one of them. Sure, if it was really him. But it isn't that simple. Jimmy's body died a long time ago. And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose. You got his hands. Beautiful hands. I didn't even know. That night. When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me. Life's like that. Grows right out of death. Your father. He was your father. If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead. It's alright, baby. Please. It's for your own good. I lied. ...I've seen things. In there. Last night. You did too. Don't tell me you didn't. You were crying like a baby. Just a bad place. And the doorway to worse. Maybe once upon a time. But that was long ago. Back before... before it became what it is. Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there. I don't want you meeting around that house. You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog. You got a vision, girl. Just like I got. Just like my momma had. And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures. That's just wasted time. Aren't you going to join us? Should I? That building? No thanks. I'm not joking boy. Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier. Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time. The blood is still there. We just gotta figure out where. ... see there ain't just two parts to a person. There's three. Body-Soul and Spirit. The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on. Jimmy's blood must still be in the house. You sure we oughta save him? Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling? You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park. You look mighty familiar to me. You sure you're not from around here?What we have to do is call the police. Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too. Boy, put that thing down. You can't take that. Might be evidence. There wasn't any draft. That window was closed. Illibent? Who's club is that? How could that be? The box was packed!
