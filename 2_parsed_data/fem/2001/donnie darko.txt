Okay, but it has to be a small one. I got in. I'm going to Harvard. That's a nice name. OK, let me see it. Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you. It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off. No I don't. She worries about you. Why would I tell Mom? What's her name? So I hear you have a girlfriend. What does time travel have to do with philosophy? Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication. Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight. I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container. I didn't realise it was such a big deal. No. I took a year off to be with you. Of course I care. Don't get angry. What? You can suck a fuck. Did you just call me a fuck-ass? Donnie? You're a dick. I haven't been accepted yet, mother.Yeah. What was his name? What happened? Hi... what's going on here? Is that a cellar door? Who's Frank? Why? Is this about the book? Where are we going? What? I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it. Yeah, they told me to get out of the house. I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up. My mom is gone. Hey. Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time. What's wrong with you? What? How long was I asleep? And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside. Infant Memory Generators. Maybe she's asleep. Oh, yeah. "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this? Who? Are you okay? What? Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us. No... Donnie, wait. I've never... You want to kiss me... And what? Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be. That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted. Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness. What happened to your neck? Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way. Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you? Donnie? And you'd never been there before? So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar? My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead. So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream? I'm going home. Sure. Where are we going? That was a compliment. You're weird. Why is that? Until it withers away. Wonder where we'll be then. You mean soap? I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind. Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero. He fled. They still can't find him. My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool. He stabbed my mom four times in the chest. Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad. He has... emotional problems. Fuck them. Don't look so freaked. Wanna walk me home? Hey...If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day. Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions. The Lifeline is divided that way. Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline. Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time. Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion. Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go. Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip. Please! Don't say those words. Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you. Rose, we have a crisis. I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham. Rose. Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts... Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear. I think we've all seen "Bonanza". The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum. I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism. And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main! The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour. Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away. She was right about the rabbits. Go. So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door? Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going. A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful. Tell them that everything is going to be just fine. It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue. Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules. I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me. Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people? Is the death of one species less tragic than another? Because the rabbits are us, Donnie. And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him? It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era. Who is Frank? Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?It feels wonderful. If I'm lucky. So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow. I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow. He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us? How was your therapy session tonight? That is a terrible nickname. You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today. I wish I knew where you went at night. Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house? We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table. When did you stop taking your medication? No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall. If that's what you think is necessary. I... What can we do? You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend? Frank? Come again? Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher. Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss... He was a year ahead of us? What? So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof. Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings. Our son just called me a bitch. Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget... It is a big deal. How did you know -- That's enough. Excuse me? If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed. Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York... But now you can't go. Beg pardon? Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon. Kitty... Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days. Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him. Do you even know who Graham Greene is? Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.Donnie! Give it back! You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal. I'm telling Mom. Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks. When can I squeeze one out?
