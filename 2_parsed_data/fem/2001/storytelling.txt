Well then, when you get older you can do something about it. It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it. For rape and murder. I know! I am sure. He wasn't. Jesus was not bad. Poison gas. He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed. He's dead. My grandchild-baby. My baby. My Jesus� Mi Jesus esta muerto! Mi Jesus�mi jesus� No. This is work. I'm always working. No, Mikey. I'm still poor. We had to work. My family was poor. I did not go to high school. No. It was God's will. Four brothers and five sisters. Yes. Yes, Mikey?What's an audience going to tell you? We're not ready! We're not ready. I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening� I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity? You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma? I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation. This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative. This is definitely better. The camerawork's nice. No, you don't. You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people. Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you. Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor. Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis. Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor. Marty, ignore him. What? Yes, Mikey? Boys, take napkins...Napkins... Don't even joke about that! Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on. He's right. It's all about who you know. You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby. Don't worry, he doesn't mean money. Marty... Got a lot of homework? The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them. Ready for tomorrow? Hi, Scooby! How was school today? Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European. How was the class? What are you going to do? Is everything OK?Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...? Oh, yeah? You heard me: leave the table! Out! Leave the table! He isn't. Don't ever say that. I don't know what's wrong with that kid. Sure!... Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing. We used pull. Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this? You started filling out your college applications yet? Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY Good. I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a�a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy. I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund. Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited? Reconceive. Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but � And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this? Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight. Tired of this shit... Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about. You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them. We have to talk. Scooby? Get the hell outta here! The same. Same as what? So? How was school today? What DO you know? Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know? I'm going in there. Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment. Come here, give me a hug! Hey, Mikey! Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream? Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me. Thanks. Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line. One in a million recover. Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair. I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.OK. Bye. Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back? Eight, six, and four. Three. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But not any more. That's good. Hunh. I do. Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom. Oh? Anything I might have seen? That's good. So then what do you do now? That's too bad. Anything I might know about? Oh, that's too bad. I believe it. Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting? Um, well, yeah. So are you still acting? Yeah. But...you called. So what's going on? Great! Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you? Who is this? Hello?I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize. That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like that bitch Catherine. Marcus...You'll write something better next time! You know he hated my story also. Don't be so upset. It's OK... I was never much of a sweater. You know that. Marcus, I'm tired. That's all. You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me. Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral. I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good. Well then, maybe you should just read the ending. Oh. What happens now? You mean, again? Huh? NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!... Nigger, fuck me hard!!... Nigger, fuck me hard! Fuck me hard! Nigger. ...gger. Ni... Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that. It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high? Thanks. Thank you for being honest. Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer? Aren't you going out with Catherine? I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean... Thank you. So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer. And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit. Good. 'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was... Can I join you? Yeah, um, then...are you alone? I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all. What are you doing here?
