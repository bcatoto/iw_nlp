You should talk to Mr. Joe. It's the way they do things. Very well. Oh yes. A long time.Like you didn't know. Who invited the bimbo? Oh I think he's cute. How's the marriage part working out? Anouk isn't like a dog, really. More like a small person. So is there anyone here for me? No one looks new. Who's that? You're not upset that I brought the dog? I hate the sight of blood. You guys don't take prisoners. Ten, fifteen minutes ago. So who won?Honey? I...wait, what are you talking about? You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about. You won't care who's in your damn movie. Things always look much worse in the morning. How nice for everybody. Come swimming. The water's glorious. You'll fix it. You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas. It's always not this time. If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone. You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do. Mac? Oh there you are. What are you doing, honey? No more work. Don't you feel breezy. So they tell me. Not soon enough, of course. How are you, Sal? You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know. A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it. Doesn't it, Mac? You can't be the center of your own world, anymore. It's alright, isn't it? My God, your wardrobe is incredible. It took me forever to decide. Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you. You saved my life. Just don't fucking tell her. You know Sophia. She's so damned judgemental. And she's so damned... perfect. And so fucking... serene. Just fucking don't tell her. Because you know Mac thinks she's God. And I can feel him comparing. I'd love a Xanex. Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding. And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy. I've got a ghastly headache, actually. I'm fine. I'm fine. Well, I'm a little stressed. And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby. I'll change back before we leave. It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours. You know it could be disaster. He's so allergic. It's terrifying. They can tell from the eyelashes, you know? He's got eyelashes yay long. They must be a foot long. The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up. Didn't I say? To dander. Otis. He's allergic. What? I'm not. What a fucking day! We only just got a sitter. I don't know her from fucking Adam. She could be a serial killer. I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number. Oh my God, the sitter. I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph. Pictures. They're always in my tote. I left my tote in the damn trailer. But! He's Mac all over again. Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet. The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth. Dander. He's allergic. Otis. So this sitter can always reach me. I'm still not used to leaving him. With a sitter. We have a sensational sitter. Jonah's really comfortable with her. You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family. Amazing with kids. Really? Really. Don't you miss it? You think so!? I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working. And that takes it's toll, you know.Take good care of it. It's not a contest. Jesus, Sally. I'm not the enemy. I told his father he'd be on that flight. Is he not going? I booked a flight. He's gonna miss his flight. I love her too, Joe. Happy anniversary. You're a good match, you two. Can you help me with this stuff? I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag. You just need to get into a car and go. You need to call your dad. She left a note. She's in ICU. Lucy overdosed. Harry called. Let's go upstairs, okay? I love you, Joe Therrian. Escape hatch. Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job. In Cheyene Walk? Lucy's going to have a meltdown. Oh, I'm so sorry. I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay. It's hard to tell with her. Oh, very jealous. Just did. Jealous? It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden. Directing suits you. Sally? What a nose. You missed your calling. No, not anymore. Happy anniversary, scout. I never put myself in harm's way. I'm the hired help.Not as a rule. Hm. You think we should ask them for their landscaper? Hm. We should do it again. A perfect night. Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus. Oh yeah? Oh yeah... Are you my big hard hero? Are you my big brave boy? Are you my brave hero? There's a test, you know. Ya Vhol. What are you, a fucking Nazi? Nice to meet you. I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry. Ours. The infamous dog? And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see? But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid. You manage to throw me off balance. I adore you. Yes I know. I started to say... I started to say Joe that -- Don't be silly. I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long... Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good. But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know? I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all. Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going. Don't you find? It's very good. I understand you won the Booker Prize. I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes. Mostly non-fiction. Did you read the new Styron? Still. Well. Let's drop it. But I am right, yes? She's based on Sally. Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful. Congratulations on the deal. How exciting. Is Sally doing Sally? I mean it's Sally. The character that's based on Sally. The character that's based on Sally in the book. Nothing that can't be exchanged. Lovely. We have a gift?You have? Excuse me? We live next door. Monica. I'm so sorry. I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know. I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair. But the moment was exactly the same. The same, you know, dynamic. And almost verbatim, wasn't it? I'm so glad. You know, I recognize that passage in your book. The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre. That's very nice. Oh yes. Nineteen...just. I'm cold. Nine...nine, yes? Nine years, just about. He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better. Yes. Medallions. Eight years, though. That's quite an accomplishment. It's really not the same thing. He was really nicer when he drank. Ryan's really angry with me. Lemon. Okay. What am I, five? I'm a little in the puke zone. I've never done this before. I don't think so. I feel. I feel a bit funny. I will treasure this. Would you sign it for me. I'm sure this is inappropriate. I'll be your best friend. Alright. Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking. Well, that's what Ryan thought. I was more generous, actually. And Ryan works at home. The wrong word, maybe. Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly. But you're very private people. You know, there's a kind of elitism... I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort. I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating. Well, yes. Yes, in fact. A little on the outside, yes. And there's been all this friction. A little out of my element. I'm a little nervous, so... Oh, yes. You know Ryan's been sober eight years. And it's difficult if I... you know. It's better if I don't. Mmm. It says something about the two of you maybe. Sally did all this herself? Your Eames table is incredible. And the B&B. I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red. Something soft. Please, Ryan. Let's just go home, okay? Don't go in, Ryan. All the ugly phone calls? We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan. They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH. Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around. Because, God help you if something happens to that dog? We have to find the dog, Ryan. I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car! Ryan, you've got to come! You've got to help me find the dog! I let their dog out. We need to find the dog. I'm going to go get my swimsuit. I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry. Ryan, you're a great man. You need a good review and you'll be fine. The whole color of the world will change, mark my words. There's only you, Ryan. You know what, Ryan? You're beautiful. I love you so much... You need... I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan. But I think you're really nice people... They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us... I think you should then. You should look in on Sheila. Do you want to go home, Ryan? I love it here. Don't you love it here, Ryan? I love it here. And I love tonight. And I love these people. And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan. Utterly fantastic. He always has two or three going... Ryan. I... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Well, whoever did this is amazing. Yes. Yes, great! It's a beautiful house. Ryan! We could hardly say no. Sally?One guess. You're fucking desperate. You don't want that. It's married and it's the neighbor. Would it make a difference? Why didn't you come in? A triumph. When did you get here? Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's not going to come up. You need to knock off the pills, Clair. Why would she care? You want a Tylenol, or something? I'd say it was down. Whatever you like. I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you. Are you alright, Clair? Borrow whatever you like. Oh. Well, probably. Oh. Oh. Why didn't you bring him? Why didn't you bring him? This is Monica and Ryan. Mac and Clair. Of course. Count on it. Damn straight. And you're not the wife. Well you could tell him otherwise. It was good of you to be all this help. But he doesn't want to go tonight. He's not going tonight. Yeah. Would you leave us alone right now? Thanks for coming. Ryan's novel. Take your time, Jer. How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do? You're out of your mind. Scout's honor. Yes. Whatever you say. The Roses? And of course they said yes. We'll be fine. He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that. You know how he hates it here. He's directing now. We couldn't be on more solid ground. Well, you're a tower of support. We've only been over this how many times? I know. I know that. Don't spoil it. I adore him. I love you, you're a genius. Fantastic. Out here. Sure. I know. They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby. Ah... He's my favorite. It's a Calder. Me too. Me too. I guess. Okay. You don't have to. I'll be with you. Everybody hates the messenger. I know. Yes. Don't make allowances. I'll never be ready. Some people just shouldn't have children. I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe. I did want it for us. But I couldn't do it. I don't really think I can do it. I'm a monster. Exactly. You think this was to hurt you?! My God, Joe. It isn't about you. I wanted you back. I told you when we met I never wanted children. I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it. You weren't listening. I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me. I had an abortion two weeks ago. Don't. Anyone else? Cal, too? Mac? Mac says it? Cal? Who? Who? Who thinks that? Not really. I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch. That's what all our friends think, anyway. It's a shit novel anyway. I don't look my age, Joe. What are you saying? About me! And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part? Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me? I'm an actress! It's about our marriage for fuck's sake. Everybody knows that... Right. And when was the last time you spoke to her? It is true. You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone. You want to talk about bullshit? Lucy called you three times this week. She's a fucking mess, Joe. Your sister is a fucking mess. She needs you. I talk to her more than you do. You've been through it. That's how you love people. When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you. And how hard it hit? It's not like this all the time. You walked out on a five year marriage. I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way. Otis! Come! Good boy! Come! What else don't I know about, Joe? Let's get really clear here. Yeah, let's talk about that. You seem to be rather an expert. I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties. Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it. But I guess that's what I interrupted. It was done. When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door. It was done. Otis, good boy, come here. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Otis!!!! Fuck you. There are fucking coyotes out there. Can't have gone far? He's like a greyhound. He could be miles away. She left the fucking gate open. Don't be so sure. Someone left the goddamn gate open. Otis got out. Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open. I'm worried about my spine. I'm very worried about my brain and my spine. It's ecstasy, Sal. Not properly watered. Dinner. Don't be angry. Truce? You've got Cal. You've got Gina. You've got Skye? We're the leftovers. Still champions. It's alright. Be our guests. Well, not yet. The gate was open? Yes. In the kitchen. And Joe's huge in Europe. He's like a rock star in London. His novels sell millions. Of course we do. We have to sign our taxes. Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors. Really? I'm going to throw up. And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake. No, no of course not. How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two? No, no of course not. It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake. You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother. They can't find a sitter... Hello? Excuse me? Yes, uh, hold on. Just a moment. It's Skye Davidson. She needs directions to the house. You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party? Well, it might be Clair. They're threatening not to come... I mean, you're really back. I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't we? No. Did you? What? Through the sweats or not? In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us. I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world. Hardly... Happy anniversary, baby. No luck. Not good. Well...wow... I was faking it. I've been feeling caged for sometime. Funny, huh? I didn't say a word. Trust him. Of course it's alright. How long ago was it? You fucking cow, can't you read?! There's a goddamn sign on the gate. I did it. I so wish I'd known. Thank you. I understand you're an interior decorator. Hors d'oeuvres or something? Are you working on a new book? Oh? Yes. And you've met Joe. Hi. Monica and Ryan? Panes is not on my team anymore. I'll have Panes if I like. Panes? We're going to have to go back out there. Thank you, Panes. That's not an answer, is it? Oh you know. No doubts. No second thoughts. Am I a monster? Thanks. Nothing's wrong. It's great, okay? Having the time of my life. Mac's a fantastic director. And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said. And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah. No. Not something new. I never like to talk about my work. I don't want to talk about it. Yes. Fine. You're a shit. No. Really. For real. Really. So how are you really doing, Panes? About five thousand dollars. With my discount. Shit. It's my Galiano. Shit! Everyday. You know it's true. We're just feeling our way back. It's our anniversary, Panes. Okay. Like the last time. Like the last time. I don't want it to be just one of our parties. Exactly what I mean. It's all ruined. They're not just our business managers, Panes. I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love. Fuck you, Panes. How? She's all over him, are you blind? Oh, Jesus, Panes. I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house. Really? I need a drink. Come hide with me. Panes is here! Will champagne help? Are you lovesick? Good, you brought your violin. I want you to play. Oh. Well, yes. It's extraordinary. You think you could sign it for us? Monica and Ryan. Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis. You're keeping a record, are you? Thank you. This was so unnecessary. I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much. We keep him in at night. Well, so glad you decided to come. Relax. You've done enough. You don't need to do that. What are they? I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center. I'll be right out. But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic. Why are you doing this? Not nice. Not kind. We're fine. We're great. We're having a baby and we're moving to London. Neither does Joe. You weren't exactly horrified. And Cal's this massive adult? Hey, let's sit down. I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin. Oh Soph, Joe loves kids. Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids. No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time. Don't I? I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted. And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready... What do you mean, thank God? Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone. Sophia! I'm not even pregnant! And the food sucks, I know. Oh Soph... She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes. You don't trust anyone. Big time. But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she? She's a genius. We're always in here. She really gets him, doesn't she? It's much more personal in here. So where should I put it? She's such a great photographer. Isn't this a fabulous picture? Nevermind. In the guest room. I've laid out a paint table for them. Like Joe. He's a novelist. And here they are! Enough about me.I think there are sixteen there. You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director. When I read your work I felt that you knew me. Women must tell you that. And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know? I am Genna. How many women must tell you that. And the script is wonderful. Wonderful and lean and visual... Oh, I love that. I'm just great. I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you. And I'm so happy you asked me to. I'm so touched. I know how private you and Sally are. Who told you that? No. I'm twenty... Five. Very. Are you asking me to marry you? If he were still alive, maybe. Yeah. Exactly! So I dug it, and I did a lot of research. I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony. Do Peter Sellers again. Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky. Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!! Really?? Oh? Thank you. Oh? No, no thanks. Yes. Oh my god. I've been so rude. I'm Skye Davidson. Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers? And I'm overwhelmed. And I want to do it justice. And I hope we can spend time together. And I'm gushing. It's my worst quality. I'm in the same room with Sally Nash. Oh my God. You're my icon. I've been watching your films since I was a little girl. Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself. I don't mind... Happy anniversary. Thank you for making me a part of it. Whatever, do you remember? I've seen all your movies. When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie. They said you were too real. I worship you. And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman. Oh my God, sorry. I'm interrupting.Let's get the kids. Are you the funniest person I know, or what? Oh. Do you have any pictures? You should have brought him. What is that thing? So where is young Jonah? Not for a second. Cal can have all that. Never. I'm glad that's all over for me. You look so well, Clair. A wraith. No you are not. You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash. You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child. "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway. His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic. Ha! Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel. Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut. You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally. It's only five months since Joe came back. His sister does. Big time. And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article. I don't have a drug problem. Cal knows who he is. Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight? Don't try and change the subject. Oh God, it feels great! He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable. He wants playmates. Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material. Honey, I'm not worried about you. You are going to be a fantastic mom. Not an issue. I pressed you, remember? Joe, on the other hand, is a different story. Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it? Oh honey, let's. Well good. Thank God. You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen. Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit. There's no excuse for pain like that. You'll hate it in London. It's wet and miserable. A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized. Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing. I trust you. Well, I don't trust her. I never have. So how much do you hate her? The both of you. A notch above the storage room. I thought it was okay where it was. Hm. Yes. Would you like to meet my husband? I hope they're watercolors! Hmm. Where are my kids? Ah. And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over. Because you're both, so, what - introspective? And you should have done it ages ago. I'm Sophia Gold. Come meet my husband, Cal. Oh my God! America told me your neighbors are coming? Evie has a little something for you.
