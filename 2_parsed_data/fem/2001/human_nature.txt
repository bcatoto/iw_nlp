I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry. So I spend the rest  of my life in jail. So what? I've  been in jail my whole life anyway. A  jail of blood and tissue and coursing  hormones... ...a jail called the human body. My soul held prisoner in this reeking,  stench-ridden bag of bones and  entrails. A bag of feces and piss  and fibroid cysts in my tits and  precancerous moles on my sun-damaged  back... At least now I'll be able to blame  the state, not God, for my  incarceration. My story begins when I was twelve. Something terrible happened when I  was twelve. Nathan, those are not monkeys. Those  are apes. Mountain Gorillas to be  precise. And furthermore... Tell him, Harold. Enough, Harold. Oh, I had sexual urges. I had the  urge to merge, officers. Inside I  was 100% Grade A female. But what self-loathing I felt! Who  would have someone as repulsive, as  unladylike as me? I did everything I  could to shield the world from this  repulsiveness. Lila, what are you doing in there? I  need to get ready for my date. Nothing! I'll be out in a minute! Look, I'll just... What the...? I don't know why you didn't tell me  about this. It's embarrassing, okay? It's not so bad. So, it just keeps growing? Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows. Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm  just trying to help. How is that helping, Natalie? How  exactly? Look, if you're going to be like  that... You should be appreciative  that I'm interested. Why, because I'm a freak and you are  beautiful, and you are being nice  enough to come down to my freak,  nonbeautiful level and act concerned  about my repulsive troubles? You're fucked up, Lila. Why don't you fucking try electrolysis  or something? Figure it out for  chrissake. At sixty dollars an hour, electrolysis  was not a feasible solution. I  explored my alternatives. I remember once coming across a  painting of Mary Magdalene entirely  covered with fur. I guess that's  where I got the idea that maybe the  Catholic Church might be a place  that encouraged excessive hair growth  in its women. So I became a nun. Heavenly Father... ...please let this hair go away. But my prayers were always so selfish. I tried being a lesbian separatist. But I guess I just wasn't attracted  to women, even hostile, man-hating,  hairy ones who wore sensible shoes. For a while I was a professional  circus freak. During the holiday season, they made  us wear costumes. Ho ho ho. Ow! You little fuck. Aside from the great dental, this  occupation was not pleasant. They say the holidays are difficult  for a lot of people. I decided there was something poetic  about killing myself with a razor  blade. The way that mouse looked at me.  There was no judgement. It didn't  care if I had hair all over my body.  I was just what I was. I felt so  free. Do you understand what I'm  saying? Birds and squirrels and rocks and  trees didn't seem to judge my hair.  I felt at peace when there were no  humans around. I figured out a way  to spend as much time as possible  with no people around. I became a  nature writer. Last night I almost died on this  mountain top, and the irony is I had  never felt more alive. I knew it was coming when in late  afternoon, a thunderhead drifted  over, sneaking in like kids through  the back door of a movie theater,  forced casual. It turned the sky a  queer shade of green. A green that  said "watch out, baby, this is gonna  hurt like hell." I could've  hightailed, but that would be  cheating. Part of the Nature  experience is recognizing its mastery  over you, your smallness in the face  of it. As Nietzsche said, what does not  kill me makes me stronger, and that  goes double if you're a woman. I became a successful nature writer. Then I became a famous nature writer.  I said to myself, fuck humanity... ...and I became a recluse. I had a  menagerie of animals at my house.  They loved me because I was me. They  loved me on the days I shaved. They  loved me on the days I didn't. For a  while this was enough. By the time I was thirty I was very,  very horny. I had to have a man in my... life.  At any cost. I would become what I  needed to become to achieve this. I  would become a hairless lie. I was rich enough for electrolysis  by this time, so I began the long  arduous process of having each  inappropriate hair burned out of my  body at the root. This is when everything changed, and  this is where my confession really  begins. Progress! Ouch. Yeah? Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth  smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a  baby's butt. I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a  real girl. You still in the market for a real  boy? Always. Ow. Cause there's this guy. My brother  knows him. Might be right up your  alley. Tell me. I could use someone up my  alley. I don't get that. Is that sexual? Shut up and tell me. Handsome, thirties, psychologist... Loves animals? Ouch. Must love  animals, Rose. Loves animals. Loves you. What do you mean? Somehow it came up that you were a  friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would  love to meet you. Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell  him about the nature of our  relationship, did he? My brother is discreet. Won't he be able to tell? My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he  won't know how women usually feel.  Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost  legally blind, which is helpful in  this situation. Plus he's got an  extremely small penis, of which he  is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances  are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be  yours forever. God, he must be really close to your  brother to tell him such personal  stuff. Yeah, well my brother is his shrink. Thank you so much. I love slugs. All  slugs, not just banana slugs. They're so even keel. They forge  ahead with slow determination. They  don't get distracted or side-tracked.  They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at  them and go, "Ewww. A slug." You've got to respect that. Where? That's not necessarily a bad thing. I'm not sure we can escape our  natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm  not even so sure anymore that we  should want to. You are a therapist, right? I hope you don't perform any of those  dreadful torture experiments, Nathan. How's it going? Paper or cloth? What's the larger experiment? Going out on a limb, aren't you,  Nathan? I'm not sure. We are animals after all. So? I really like him, Rose. He's so... ...passionate about his work. My brother says he likes you, too. Really? Yeah. Says he likes you even more  than he likes his own mother. And  according to my brother Nathan's  abormally close with his mother. My God, no! My God! Oh, Nathan. That is the wrong fork, young man. Harold, tell the boy. Harold, tell the boy more. Harold! Tell the boy again. And? It looks wonderful. Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is  delish... I'm sorry? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really  learned those things. Boy, this is good! No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward  in certain areas. You do? You really enjoy my company? I like you, too, Nathan. Yeah But I have some peculiarities also. Like nothing. My brother says things are going  really well between you and Nathan. I cannot believe how in love I am  with this man. Yeah? He's so cute. I even like his cute  little penis. It's like a little  pig's penis or something. Rose, we connect on every level.  I've finally found someone I can  feel completely safe with. Don't throw that away. I had that  once with a guy. But I threw it away  for a cheap thrill. One night stand? No. I married a midget. Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill? Well he wasn't really a midget. He  was on the cusp of midgethood. That's  what made it cheap. Had he been an  actual midget, there would've been  nothing cheap about it, my dear. I didn't know you were into that  sort of thing. Let me tell you, honey, midgets are  the best kept secret in male  companionship. They're portable.  They're controllable. They're eager.  And they're exactly the right height  for a little covert oral fun on the  dance floor. I have a friend you might like to  meet. Oh? Three foot one. Be still my crotch. Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's  asked me to move in with him. Yeah. My brother told me. And I think I'm going to. Stand on a stepladder sometimes. It's lovely to finally meet you, Mr.  and Mrs. Bronfman. I've heard so  much about you and I've seen you in  photographs from Nathan's childhood,  but it's nice to meet you in the  flesh. I must say, you look exactly  the same as in the photographs. Thank you, dear. Nathan! Tell him, Harold. Goodness, you two look exactly as  you did in those old photos. Yes, so you mentioned earlier, dear. I love nature. As long as it stays  in the zoo where it belongs. Don't you agree, dear? I'll be out in a minute. You didn't seem sorry when you were  laughing at all your mother's stupid,  tasteless, cruel animal jokes. Do you? Do you? Oh do you, darling? Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's  celebrate with a long hike in the  woods tomorrow! It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my  old stomping grounds! I don't think so. Why? Yes, darling. Of course. Fifteen. Yes, darling. Yes. Absolutely. That's very funny. It was a flash of white. I ruled out  deer immediately. Too... upright. Did you see that? I don't know. Something. No. Too... upright. Might've been a  person. Come on. He bolted. Who are you? You don't understand my language, do  you? I take it back, you do understand my  language. Oh God. I think he's feral. He looks perfectly fine. I don't understand you. This is  fascinating and you just want to run  away. I mean, here we have a human  being totally uncontaminated by  civilization, totally free, and all  you want to do is run back to your... What? Look at him. He doesn't understand  English. He moves like an animal. Nathan, what the hell are you talking  about? Oh no. You can't take him from his  home, Nathan. I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's  happy here. You'd be taking away his freedom,  Nathan. Oh God, I have no one. Nothing. You  give me this beautiful gift, this  glorious sunset. But with no one to  say "isn't that a beautiful sunset"  to, it becomes meaningless, just  another stupid sunset. They happen  everyday. So what? All right. Doctor... Oui, doctor, oui. Oui. Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet  little mongrel puppie named Puff  when I was a girl. This one reminds  me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute! I loved my doggie very much, monsieur. Oui. Perfect! Dr. Bronfman! Dr. Bronfman! Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I  very much enjoy working with you. Now I'm embarrassed that I say this. Merci. I... Do you... would you like  to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps? Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive  me. I should not have asked such a  stupid question. I know you are a  very important man and... I am a foolish little thing. I am  pink in my face, no? It is only that  I have been so lonely lately and...  I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow,  okay? Unless... Am I fired now? Thank you so much for accompanying  me. I have had such a difficult time in  my personal life and you seem to be  such a nice man... but I'm talking  too much again, no? You're so sweet. Oh, why are there  not more men out there like you? You know just the right thing to  say. I like it when you say my name. Is  that stupid? Nothing. Be right out. Who is it? Who is it? Who from work? Who is it, Nathan? Nathan, I... It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help  it. I'm sorry. I'm getting electrolysis. It's  working, but it takes time. So  meanwhile I have to... Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch! I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me  for this. I'm the same person I was before you  knew, damn it! Oh God! Oh God, why... do... I... have...  to... be... like... Oh, no! Oh, shit! Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Who's  there? Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry  to disturb you. I just came for some  papers I left. Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time.  I am sorry. Is everything fine? I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered  I left some papers I need to go over. See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so  embarrassed. Coincidence, yes? And how is our son? I should turn them off. Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama  sang to me when I was a little girl. Oui. There. Shall we close up, then? It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into  you, both in our silly pajamas. It  is two happy coincidences, no? Yet you look so sad. A great man  like you should not be sad. I am sleepy. Really? I always think myself so  ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A  wallflower. Thank you so much. Merci. It's very  wonderful to hear a man say such a  nice compliment. You are sweet. Doctor. Shh. You are an animal. I love being female because it, how  do you say, allows me to be close to  men. Anyway it's time he grew up. N'est- ce pa? I love chest hair on a man. I know  it isn't fashionable now, hairy men.  But to me it is the very sign of  masculinity. What is wrong, my darling? Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment  please. Lila. So, how's it going today? Honey, can we talk tonight? You know,  about stuff? Things have been so  strained for the past three weeks,  since you know, and I just want to  talk. Please, Nathan. I really need this.  You've been working late a lot. I don't know, Nathan. What are you  supposed to do? Funny. I thought that's exactly what  you did. You just don't have the  courage to admit it to yourself. Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan?  I just have to know. It would just be helpful to know. Because, you know, you seem so  distant. And you work late every  night. And we hardly ever have sex,  and when we do, it's... I don't know.  It feels different. Do you like my new look? I'm trying, you know. I'm trying to be what you want. I  want to be what you want, Nathan.  All I want is to be what you want. Really? Because I'm really trying, you know.  Rosie says maybe only another two  years of the elctrolysis. I've signed up for a ballet class.  And look at my nails! A real girl! Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby! Hmmmph. Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I. Not in front of the boy. Stop. Get away. You have to choose Nathan. It's like  Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's  choice. Did you ever see that movie,  Sophie's Choice? It is like that.  Only it is this. No! It is now that you must decide. I love you, Doctor Nathan... ...but I will not wait. I will not  be your chippy. I will not be your  little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side  dish. My love. I want to have a sweet tiny  baby inside my belly... from you. But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan. Oh! I didn't see you there, sneaky boy! You're like a boy sneaking in... You remember that from my book? I'm  touched! What's wrong? I'll make it. I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's  going to be so great! Scotch on the  rocks, right? Just kidding. I know what you drink,  mister. I know what you drink. Voila! How's work? No. I don't want your work to be  cruddy. Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire  somebody else? Hey! I could come work for you! I  know I haven't been all that  supportive of this project, but I've  come around. Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a  wonderful project you're doing, taking  this poor unfortunate, uncivilized  creature and turning him into a human  being! What a wonderful wonderful  compassionate man you are! Yes! And I want to help. You won't  have to pay me, and I was thinking  of giving up that crazy nature writing  anyway. Who needs it? I have you and I have  being a woman and I have thinking  about womanly things! I love being a  woman because... Such as my man and how to please  him! Such as making wonderful dinners for  my man! Such as looking pretty for my man! And I'm writing an article on quilting  for the Ladies Home Journal! I had sold my fucking soul. That was wonderful! You were wonderful today, darling.  Such authority with the ape-man boy.  It made me so hot for you. The way you are taming him, it sends  chills down my girlish spine and...  everywhere else, too. Take me, darling! Tame your little  monkey of love! Well, I'm tamed, Dr. Bronfman. Oh boy! It's okay, Puff. It's an animal urge, Puff. It's  nothing to be ashamed of. You just have to control it. We're  not apes. How you all doin' today? Very well. Good enough! What can I get for you? The what, honey? Oh, the Reuben?  That's a sandwich with corned beef  and sauer... Absolutely! Should I come with? Ummm. It's good. You're kidding! Holy shit. Yeah, no duh! I had a wild hair up  my ass over that for a month. Yeah? What? Call you back. You bastard! What do you want? We have nothing to say! You are a  rotten bastard, that's what! Why? You've made your decision, Mister  Stinky American! Now I hate you! No,  I don't hate you; I don't even think  about you! Like what? What for? You think too much. I need a man who  doesn't think so much but acts more  than he thinks... is what I need! You heard me! You make me sick when  you pretend to not understand what I  am saying to you! Go away from here! All right, already! Come in if you  must! The door's open, you son of a  bitch! In here, you lousy piece of merde. Well? Please. I look a mess. Anyway. Come already to the point. I've moved on. I've been seeing Johannsen in  chemistry. That's not how he tells it. Hunh. You hurt me, you know, when you made  Nathan's Choice. Does that not even  matter to you, you pig? You were gone a long time. So he's doing okay? That's funny because, you know, I  just went and picked him up at some  flophouse on the lower eastside. He  called here when he ran out of his  "mad" money after spending an entire  evening drinking, watching strippers,  and fucking a whore! Oh, and what did you do tonight,  honey? And what did you do tonight, honey? And what did you do tonight, honey? Do you know what I gave up to be  with you? I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I  gave up my body hair! How the hell would you know anything  about the human heart? How's that for ladylike, Nathan. For two weeks I holed myself up in a  motel room. I didn't even know who I  was. My world had crumbled. There is  nothing that makes you feel dirtier  than finally deciding to sell your  soul and finding no buyers. No maid service! For God's sake,  can't you read the fucking "do not  disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob? Lila, it's Rosie. Go the fuck away, Rosie. Please, honey, let me in. Rose, please go away. Lila, I want to help you. How'd you know where I was? Nathan told my brother. Your brother should have his license  revoked. Yeah, although I'm not going to turn  him in. I like hearing the dirt. Why didn't your brother tell you  that Nathan was having an affair? I don't know, honey. I don't know.  Maybe he just didn't want to get  involved. Oh, Rosie. Let's get you out of here. Come stay  with me until you get your strength  back. Free electrolysis, if you want it!  We'll get that face of yours cleared  up in no time. Yeah. I gotta get myself together. I  want to look good. If I'm gonna fuck  with Nathan, and I am, I want him to  want to fuck me when I do it. You were wonderful! Don't be silly! And you were wonderful, too! I loved  the way you said " au revoir." Done! Ready! So we've got seventeen new bookings  for speaking engagements, my wonderful  men. That's Lila? Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt.  And don't let the hirsutism fool  you. I know more about being a woman,  and more about the black hearts of  men than you, in your pretty little  powdered, bullshit fantasy world,  can ever imagine. I know the darkness  and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie. Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best. See, Frank and I are kindred spirits.  We both know what it's like to be  shunned because of our appearance.  We both know how easily that turns  into self-hatred. Sorry I'm late, parking is a bitch  at this place. Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will. With pleasure. I'm going to miss you. Oh, Rosie. And I'm going to miss the lifestyle  having you as a client has afforded  me. Shut up, you. I like you so much, with or without  hair. But don't spread that around. Bad  for business. I'm really glad you two found each  other. Souls have nothing to do with it,  babe. I'll be in touch. No you won't. But it's okay. You  have stuff you gotta do. Gotta go. Stay. Out. Bad. Get up. Take off your clothes. We're going back to nature, you and  I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm  going to make you free again if I  have to kill you doing it. You what? Good. I'll show you how, apey. Talking is to be kept to a minimum.  Eventually, when we are ready, there  will be none. Language was invented  so that people could lie to each  other and to themselves. There is no  other reason. You lose. Any answer is the wrong  answer. You'll thank me eventually, Puff.  Well, you won't thank me, because we  won't be speaking, but you'll sort  of thank me with a special look, the  look a dog gives you to let you know  he loves you. A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri. How did you know we... Tell him, Harold. Harold, ask Nathan what's wrong. Yes, please, somebody ask him what  is wrong. Oui. We still have you and I. Where do we look for little lost  Puff? That is horrible. Apes are dirty.  No? Okay, my sweet. Good night. Please let me go with you. Okay. It was paradise. At least for a tiny little while. Ugnh. Oook. Oook. Ooka. Puff, don't. Then I shot Nathan. He's dead. No. This is the end of the road.  There's a dead human being here. For  all of his faults, he was a human  being, and certainly a victim of his  culture as much as anybody. Puff, what happened to you is as  much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe  more so, because I knew it was wrong  and I went along with it anyway. I'm  taking responsibility for the murder.  I want you to go back to your old  life. No. Go back to the woods. This is a  sacrifice I need to make. In my world  we have something called penance.  It's another abstraction, but I had  the concept drummed into my head  during my years in the convent. It  doesn't exist for you, and it  shouldn't. See, I could never be  free again anyway, so I might as  well be in jail. That's what I'm counting on. Okay. If you think it will help. Wait! I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking  for you for thirty years. Then there  you were, such a beautiful, beautiful  grown man. Yes... Derek. Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew  that was going to be what you would  say. It's good to see you again  though. I'm in the book, if you ever want to  drop me a line or something. Hello, my little boy. Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like  you asked. Say my name. You remind me so much of Nathan. You remind me so much of Nathan plus  so much of my little mongrel doggie. Hush. No, it is never terrible to be  in love. Nathan's memory lives on in  our sacred union. I'm not sorry she killed him either.  Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite  and sophisticated and charming. You  are all that, too. But you have  something more. You have a bit of  the animal in you. French?
