What's so damn funny? Heads up, man. What's this thing on  my back? This is bullshit! Hey! Jee-zus, man! What the hell now?  Another damn test? Check the table in the corner. He's a pretty good actor, though. They're shooting for real! This is  all real. It's like you said, every man for  himself. They're all over the place! What the  hell's going on? Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're  talking a lousy million five U.S. Do you know what a wire transfer is? My goodness, a word with four  syllables. I should get some ice  before your brain gets too hot. So cute. He shows up for a battle of  wits with a mental butter knife. You'll have forty-eight hours to  complete the transfer. Don't waste  our time. Nothing. He had two days. Yorgi asked me to. Go to hell. Mind your business. Why are you still hanging around?  Your business is finished, you should  go home. I don't know who you are or where  you come from, but I don't like you.  You ask too many questions. Don't even bother, X man, I'm not  your type. My chest is too small and my brain  is too big. Yeb vas, z'opa. Shut up! What are you doing? Who are you? I also remember you drove your car  here. Who are you really? Make no  mistake, I will shoot you and not  feel bad about it. Who are you working  for? Bullshit. I see you look at  everything, study everything, ask  questions. I know exactly what you're  doing. Empty your pockets. Maybe we should start again, yes? I  know so little about you, except  that you're not what you say you  are. I don't know what you're talking  about. Go to hell! What are you? Perogies, potato pancakes, fried  goose livers, the sausage plate and  a pot of Turkish coffee. That's how you eat? It's like a  gerbil. So why don't you tell me something  about who you gather information  for. They obviously have very deep  pockets. Are you from a rival clan? Whoever sent you knew what they were  doing. You and Yorgi are practically  twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims  who make a lot of noise but don't  say much. You agree with a lot of what he says,  don't you. Don't even start. I'll be honest, I  don't trust you. Bur lets pretend  for a minute that what you say is  true, that I want to leave. What can  you do about it? All I have to do is risk my life  providing you with these facts. A beach named X? That I'd like to  see. Da! Yes. They tell me you're an American agent. There's no more time for games. They  made you. There's a sniper out front  waiting to put a bullet in your eye.  Tell me if it's true. Jesus Christ. You're going to have  to go out the back. The data that  you copied with your toy. Tomorrow,  at six o'clock. Look it up. We're  taking a trip. Be there at six and  you'll have plenty to tell your  people. That's alright, I'll figure something  out. I can't let this happen. I want you  to go out the back. I'll make up  some excuse. What are you doing? I'd forgotten how exciting it is  working together. Why don't we go below decks and work  off some of this adrenaline. No, something worse. He says it's a  surprise, but I know him. This is  his masterpiece. There's something I didn't have time  to tell you before. I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been  undercover for over a year. I don't know. Eight months ago I  stop hearing from my people. No  explanation, just silence. So I stay  and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm  in so far, they'd kill me if I left.  Now every day I get farther and  farther away from what I was. I'm  like you said, a criminal. No, I guess I've been no help at all  to you. Of course. I'll do what I can. I  have to go, before they notice. You can't, it's too risky. I'm not  much help anyway, remember? Are you alright? I heard you talking. I could tell  where you were in the room. I know which cops are good and which  are bad. Come with me. Come on, right  now. We're getting out of this place.  We've done enough. It doesn't matter anymore, forget  it. What do we owe our governments? Yours  kidnapped you, mine abandoned me. No, now it's about us. Let's do  something for us before we both get  killed. Don't you want to get to  Bora Bora, Xander? Why? You're the one who believes in  nothing. Screw the world, or whatever  you said. They left. To a fortress in the  mountains. Aren't you afraid? I must be healthy, then, because I'm  scared to death. I guess I'd better  get back to Yorgi. Yes, I do. You're right. I can't  just let him go free. Besides, I can  help you from the inside. I was supposed to wait for the cop  to kill you and then kill the cop.  They'll believe me. I've been lying for so long, one  more time won't hurt. What the hell are we doing? We're  doing all this together, trusting  each other, making plans, and we  haven't even slept together yet. Yorgi, I thought he was -- The Peace conference... Don't you see, X? For the betterment  of humanity, he's going to start  World War Three. Yorgi and Kirill. If they launch it, I know how to  bring it back. He owns a big industrial complex on  the river. He'll launch it from there. No! Don't shoot! He's hiding behind  the nerve agent! Go to the water, it's that way! Let me. Fantastic options. A piece of shrapnel hit me. He's shut out the communication  circuit! No, it's like a safety. We are going  to have to access the manual controls. It's running three meters down. Twenty  knots. By then it's too late! The only way  to safely dispose of the nerve agent  is in deep water! The chemicals will  break down and dissipate! There it is! Hold it steady! Xander! It's coming up! I can't believe my mission is finally  over. I don't even know what to do  with myself. What are you doing?
