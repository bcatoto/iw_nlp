Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Good weekend? Do anything special? Today is bath day. Today is bath day. Happy bath day. Syevodnya Party. Party. Syevodnya. Well you just get better. I'll tell  Beaky. You just get some rest, ok? "Frenzy". They go. John. They go. They go. They go. That's John. He's always surprising  you with hidden talents. Well, Maestro, give us a tune. It's weird at first. Sort of exciting  and frightening at the same time.  Wouldn't you say John? So? Sixty four thousand, eight hundred. What was 'Cats' like? It's enough isn't it? You know what I mean babe, It's  enough. We can stop. Yes. It's nothing. I burnt myself. It is. I did it cooking. What? I did it cooking. What? Listen, I made you something. Put it on. It's taken me weeks. I want to see  you in it. Do you like it? Say thank you. We're going to have a baby. You heard what I said. I'm pregnant.  I've been throwing up for weeks. We're having a baby. Name it. Great. You've split my fuckin, lip. I'll have an espresso, with a small  pastry, a croissant or something. Just get me a coffee. He'll have a coffee. I don't expect you to understand. You don't understand anything. It's makes it easier. Okay. It makes it faster. If I don't speak  to the men, they fall faster. It's  pretty obvious why. So what are you going to do? They don't blame you. When a bank  employee does this they understand.  You get your life back. Anyway I bet  you hated that bank. Why else would you send off for me?  If you just wanted sex just go to a  prostitute. No. John, I need your help. No I don't. I know you just want to punish me -- So you're just going to be vindictive You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt  already. My name isn't Nadia. Where's the restroom? I'm going to be sick. Where's the... I'm going... I am... I'm going to be  sick. Where's the restroom? The toilet. Where's... What are you doing? Plenty of women have babies in prison. You don't have to do this. I can  look after myself. What? Yes. I don't have any money. I said I don't have any. I don't want to talk about him. It's none of your business. Look, if you want to know is he better  in bed than you then yes he is. If what you want to know is does he  have a bigger cock than you, then  yes he does. But, you know, so what? He will come back. He left me my passport and ticket.  It's pretty clear he wants to see me  again. No. But you tend to tie them up. Why not? You don't want to talk about it. Okay we won't talk about it. We'll pretend it never happened. I don't hate you. And? What are you saying? And who says what is wrong. What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me  how it feels exactly. Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional  journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's  pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina. Funny. Usually it's the first thing  they do. Sometimes. Sometimes neither. There's nothing wrong in liking sex,  John. Why? So now you hate all women? Oh. I think you will recover okay. I  think you got what you paid for. You... You didn't mind too much. So what did you want? I think we  understand each other, no? You don't understand you either. It's no big thing. You are the same  as most men. You are a man so you  are a savage. Not a monster, but  half animal. You put on a tie and  you go to the bank, but really you  are a beast. But also you are from  woman so you have a soul. Half beast,  half soul. But you hide your beast  in the bottom of the wardrobe. It's  not so healthy. It's fucked you up,  no? Excuse me? You are throwing me out. You prefer your women mute. Car trouble? It's another twenty miles. It's going  dark. What now? You know, in Russia, there's no work  for women. It's a different world. What? I... I wasn't saying... I wasn't saying anything. Fifteen. You don't know him. He was  very kind and strong. The rest of the world, John, it's  not all like St. Albans. You are pretty naive if you think it  is. I don't have nothing. I have my baby. No. No. Not really. Maybe a little. Listen. I think it's a fox. It sounds close. I can't see anything. It's too dark. What happened between you and the  blonde? The thin... the girl with small eyes.  The one in your cupboard. Did she leave you? Come on. It's  nothing to be ashamed of. Who did  she leave you for? Your best friend?  Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you  for a woman, John? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt  you. I'm sorry. That's awful. Forgive  me. I'm sorry. What? She's alive? She's alive!! She is not dead? I'm trying to quit. I smoke more these days. I smoke  more when I'm unhappy. Maybe I want to die. Don't you want  me to die? Except for Small Eyes. So why did it end? What was her name? Listen. It's definitely a fox. Now  I'm scared. You know you can come under the  blanket. I've got an hour. Can I buy you a  coffee? Okay. Thank you. John. These are for you. Please. Why not? No it wasn't. Goodbye. What are you doing here? Stop. What are you doing here? Stop it! Leave him! No I haven't. I'll kill you if you try. Get their passports. Get your money. Goodbye. Something else. Promise. I'm quitting. This will be my last  one. So. Goodbye. You didn't deserve me John Buckingham. I'm sorry. You prefer your women... It's not mine. It's what you came back for. You're a big surprise, you know. I'm not asking you to marry me. It's more like a date. Tell me about it. All that matters is to try... We can only try. Say it. Maybe you will find out. Hurry. I'll wait for you here. My name's Sophia. Hello John. Nadia! Nadia!
