George, I went to the doctor. I don't have two years. Two years. George, I can't wait that long. What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict? Surprise. Relax, baby. We're going to wind up like us. Oh, they weren't that bad. I mean, they were kind of cute. Nice first impression. A nose bleed in front of your parents. Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you? I feel like shit. Me and my frigging nosebleeds. Yeah, I don't feel so well. Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry. Are you kidding? We're gonna call it California sinsemilla. Sounds exotic. You happy, baby? What is? Derek! You'll see for yourself. You happy, baby? What is? Derek! You'll see for yourself.

G-d, son. You mean the drug money? Yes, I got it. Yes, Barbara. She was very pretty. Yeah. We heard all about it. I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend. Take your boots off. You're tan. The boy is happy, Fred. Don't be such a killjoy. Oh, shut up, Fred. Shut your big fat mouth. You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway. Look at this credenza. If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that? It's got to cost a fortune. You, you big old tightwad. He still has his communion money. Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway. That's right. Layaway. Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate. Yes. Of course. But, I'm talking about that ring. It's something else. Let me tell you. I just can't get over the size of that ring. I just love it. Fred, look at it. Tell me you don't love that ring.I know, Dad. I love you too. Shhhh. I know, Dad. I know... It's alright, Dad. Swear on my life. I don't believe you. You swear? But I've got school. You know I can't. Mom will never let me go. You swear? Where are you going? Bye, Dad. See you in the morning, okay? California. No. I just kind of like the sound of it. Yeah. You mean, like a trip? Do what you want, it's a free country. What do you want from me? I don't want, alright? It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George. You blew it, now leave me alone. What? George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay. Well, here I am. See? What are you doing here? Are we gonna split up? What's happening to us?Mama, vos sos bien antigua. Como lo va a matar con un picahielo. Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima. Que va hacer? Thanks. I am. Where's Martha? Better than you. George, he wasn't asking. Well, I got a call from Pablo. He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down. His exact words were "Fuck Diego." Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego? Kristina's fine. Hey, George. You okay? She's getting big. Getting her own ideas. Hey, look. You start paying, who knows what will happen. You're a good father, George. I always gave you that. But you've got to talk to her. Yeah? I better see some money out of it. I haven't seen one dollar from you. You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony. Yeah. She told me. You walk her to school. What do you want? Fuck you, George. I knew you'd say something like that. Always thinking about yourself. You should have taken better care of me, you know? You've been away a long time. Four years. Say something. That's right. Always spying, always judging. Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy. You let Diego fuck you in the ass. Maybe you are a fucking faggot. You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me. My problem? We're broke, that's my fucking problem. And you're a fucking spy. Fuck you, George, just fucking drive. Don't give me that shit. You just better do something. Don't touch me. Tell me. Just answer the question. What do I spend? What? How will we live? What are we going to do?! What are we going to use for money?! Oh fucking relax. Let your hair down for once. It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes. You're such a fucking pussy. I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid. Out. Can you lift the furnace. I need money. I said, I've seen it before. Yeah. I know. She did that before. She did that before. Pablo said no? George. Oh, Jesus Christ, George. Look at you. Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I? You better know what you're doing, George. You're playing with fire. I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George. Why are you smiling? I don't think so. Hello.
