You happy, baby? We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic. It's gonna work, Derek. Any message? What do you want me to do?  I can only take two bags, and I can't fly back here everyday. Georgie, we're gonna get busted if we keep this up. Hey, fuck you, Dulli.  I'm not Mexican. I'm Italian. You're Italian? Are you kidding? I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring. Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about that ring.  It's something else.  Let me tell you. George has exquisite taste. What is that, two carats?  That's got to be two carats. I don't know. Yes.  It's at least two carats, darling. Treasure it. Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway. That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate. You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway. The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy. Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry. Barbara, here, take my napkin. Thanks.  I'll be okay. Yeah, I don't feel so well. I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds. Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you? Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents. Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute. Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us. Surprise. What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict? Two years.  George, I can't wait that long. George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years. Take your boots off.  You're tan. Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend. Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty. You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it. G-d, son. George! I had no choice. Don't look at me like that.  What was I supposed to do?  You're in our house. What, was I supposed to be an accomplice? You don't think people know you're a drug dealer?  Everyone knows.  It's no secret.  How do you think that reflects on me?  Every time I go out, I'm humiliated.  I see the stares.  I hear the whispers.  How do you think that makes me feel?  Did you ever once stop and think of me? So you go to jail.  It's for your own good.  You need to straighten your life out. Friday? Get your hands off me. You have a phone call. Look, honey, a power boat. Hello. I don't think so. Why are you smiling? I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George. You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire. I do. I need a fucking drink. Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I? It's all so beautiful. What do you think, Dad? Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune. I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap. Oh, I see. Come on.  I'll show you the rest of the house. Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha? Que va hacer? Alguna cosa tiene que hacer. No Puedes hacer ni un culo. No le escusches a mi yerno.  A el solo le importa la plata. Vos lo tenes que matar, ahorita mismo. De lo contrario vas a quedar como un marica sin horror. Sabes que, vos no tenes pantalones. Nadie te va a respetar.  Usa esto.  Deja solo un huequito tan pequeno, que ni sangre le va a salir a ese malparido del Diego. Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima. George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you. Pablo said no? George, it's time!  George!  George! He fainted. George! She did that before. Yeah.  I know.  She did that before. I said, I've seen it before. Can you lift the furnace.  I need money. Out. Now let's fucking party, motherfuckers! Let's have some fucking fun. Happy birthday, baby.  Do a line. Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid. Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here. Don't you dare step one foot in this house.  You're not my son, you hear me? I don't have a son anymore. What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?! Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live? Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something. What's happening to us? Are we gonna split up? Fuck you, George, just fucking drive. My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy. That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me. He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine dealer!  There's a kilo in his trunk right now!  Take this sorry motherfucker to jail! I'm divorcing you, George.  I'm getting custody of Kristina.  And when you get out next week, you're going to pay support and that's the end of it. Alright?  There's someone else.  I'm sorry. You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something. Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself. I thought you couldn't live without your heart. What are you doing here? Well, here I am.  See? George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay. What? I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone. What do you want from me? Do what you want, it's a free country. You mean, like a trip? I don't know.  Maybe California. Yeah. No.  I just kind of like the sound of it. California. Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay? What do you want? Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school. I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony. Yeah?  I better see some money out of it. Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her. She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas. Hey, George.  You okay? Where are you going? You swear? You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go. But I've got school. You swear? I don't believe you. Swear on my life. Kristina's fine. Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego? Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego." George, he wasn't asking. Better than you. I'm here to see my father. Name? Kristina Sunshine Jung. Jung. Belongings in here. Feet on the blue line. Miss? Miss?  Something wrong? It's alright, Dad. I know, Dad.  I know... Shhhh. I know, Dad.  I love you too.
