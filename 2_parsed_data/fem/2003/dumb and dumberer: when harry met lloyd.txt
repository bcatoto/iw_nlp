Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here. What? No! Look. Okay, what? What are you wearing? What? My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner. HARRY? Are you okay? Just down the hall. What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help. Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years. Sit down, I have something to tell you. LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller? I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher. Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you. Would you like something to drink? Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal. Yeah... Come over around seven. You and Lloyd chose the class!? Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate... You did? That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam. HARRY! A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow. Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class. Hey guys. Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine. I'm Jessica Matthews. I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store. You're the kid who was home schooled. Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right? Excuse me. Hi. Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special. You mean the lunch room? Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady. Are you wearing a coconut bra? So can I come along? Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy. MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class. THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE. That's not your tape. I don't know what you're talking about. So what did you say to my parents on the phone? My parents are going to wonder where I am. I don't know what you're talking about. Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs? And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student. Being a jerk doesn't make you special. TURK, what are you doing here? TURK, leave him alone. He's going to be in jail for a long time. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of. LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest? HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess. Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here. That's my boyfriend. No, it was a complete waste of time. That's it. I'm done. I'm so close I can feel it. Let's just do it and get out of here. Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it. Well, something stinks. Oh, baby, you're the bestest. So, when can we do it? So could you get us into the principal's office? Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain. HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something. What? Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up. What are you doing here? Well I was born in St. Louis. Yes, what? This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends. Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys. HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class. I'll talk to you later.Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke. No, it actually fit quite nicely. Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide. You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history. Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless. He was a big loser! What are you deaf!? Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser. Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.So boys, how was your first day? Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up. LLOYD, did you ask your parents? Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend. Right. Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy. You're going to be just fine, HARRY. I don't follow. It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school. Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age... How was that? You know I do! Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world. Hey you two. Lights out. It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup. He passed away three years ago.I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all. I thought I told you to get lost. Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off. Oh, you're good. No. Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce. Well, I see you have a camera. I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi. So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now? That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware? People! Come on. "Parade" float. No. Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you. What the hell are you talking about? I think you did it. Ha! Too big to make the turn! Left here! Left! That's great, now make a left, then straight! Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here! What? Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus. Lose her! Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself. This is horse? Love it! This band sounds terrible. So the chest is still out there somewhere. Are you going to kill her? She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions. It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip. Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it. Where is it? The evidence of what? What papers? Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for? Oh, just like the President. Everything? So what do you keep in there? Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true. You got the Extender? It's a surprise. Guess what"s under these coconuts. Knock knock. Wow, you are smart. And...? To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer? Times two. Oh wow. Look at you. You said "aloha" twice. We start our own class? Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money! It's the big potato. How baby-cakes? You've done it all. God, I've missed you. ... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
