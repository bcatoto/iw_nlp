Mr. Harris? Mr. Kazuzo sent me. Can I enter? Mr. Harris? Do you like massage? Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy. My stockings. Take them. No - Lip  them... Don't touch me! Lip my stockings! Lip them! Please let me go! Let me go! Mr. Harris Can you stay until Friday? We're looking into it Bob, but they  really want you to stay to do that  talk show Friday, apparently it's a  really big deal, he's the Johnny  Carson of Japan. These people are paying you a lot,  do you think you could consider it? Ok, you're scheduled to leave  Saturday, but we'll hold a seat  Thursday in case, but first class is  full, you're waitlisted for an  upgrade... there might be a seat on  Lufthansa... Are you awake? John? I'm not sure. What are you doing here? Oh. I'll just have a beer. My husband's here for work-he's a  photographer- and I just came  along...I'm not really doing anything  right now, and we have some friends  who live here. Two years. You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche? 25 years... that's a long time...  Are you still in love with your wife? Oh. I'm not sure, yet... I graduated  last spring. Philosophy. I don't know, but I can think about  it, a lot. Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis  will work out,too. I wish I could sleep BOB Me, too. John! What are you doing here? Promoting that action movie I did... ...doing like twenty million  interviews a day... It's soo good to  see you. How long are you here for? It's amazing  there! No!  Hi! So great to meet you! Hi, nice to meet you. You know, John, you're my favorite  photographer, I only want to be shot  by you. Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've  been sweating in this little room  with T.V. lights for hours... ...Well, I have the worst  headache,  I have to go find some aspirin. But,  call me, let's have a drink, I'm  under Evelyn Waugh. Evelyn Waugh? Evelyn Waugh was a man. Why do you have to defend her? No, I thought it was funny. Forget  it. Hi, leave a message... fabulous time in Japan!  How exciting,  and hope you and your adorable husband  are enjoying it...I was sitting next  to Cathryn Myles last night at this  dinner and she was telling me about  her daughter who had this awful  boyfriend and a messy break-up and  how hard it is,and now she's single  and wants to start a family, I'm so  glad that you're settled, and not in  that situation.  Anyway, call me  when you have a chance, I'm trying  to put Thanksgiving plans together,  whether we want to go skiing or.  Daddy wants to stay home and have it  here, which might be easier with  Lauren and the children, but let me  know what your feelings are, I do  hope you and John can make it. Call  me, I love you. What was it like working with Keanu  Reeves? It was great. I've known him for a  while now- you know we both live in  L.A. We both have dogs... How'd it go today? Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you. Sure. ...My Dad was anorexic. (she's never heard of that) Really? He was on the American side at the  Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was  taken prisoner, and they tortured  them about their food the whole time. My dad fought on the American side  at the Bay of Pigs. So, when he was  a prisoner, they would tell them  they had put poison in their food  and they would make themselves throw  up... and when he got back, he did  better, but he still has food issues.  He has to have really clean food.   And really simple. He can't just go  have, say, Chinese food. Yeah, it is. ...Oh my god you have to try it,  this power cleanse is amazing- it's  lemon juice and grade B maple syrup  and cayenne pepper for seven days.  Just like a half a teaspoon of  cayenne. The first few days you're a  little scattered, but by day four -  it's amazing... my eyes were so  white... Hi again, how's it going? I went to a temple today and I didn't  feel anything. I don't know what to do. You smell weird. Like popcorn? Hair stuff? Bye. Lauren? Charlotte?! How's Tokyo? It's cool... but,I don't know... I  went to a shrine today and all these  little monk's were chanting... and,  I didn't feel anything... I even  tried ikebana, ...   and John's using  hair products... I don't know who Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec? Sure. Sorry about that, what were you  saying? Oh, it's nothing... I better go,  I'll talk to you later. Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky  you don't have any kids yet and you  can go off to Japan... call me when  you get back. Ok, bye. Ouch. Yeah. Do you think it's done? But I like to... and I don't smoke  that much. Ok, I will... later. Oh... that's nothing, someone gave  it to me. I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm  not into it. Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some. Are you sure you have to go? Yeah, I know you have to work the  whole time, I'll probably have more  fun here. I'll call Charlie and those  guys. I love you. I miss you. Oh, hi. Yeah. Did you get some sleep? Not really. How long are you here  for? Oh, good. Do you want to go to a  party tonight with me and some friends  who live here? See you later. You really are having a mid-life  crisis. No. Charlie, this is Bob. Bob � Charlie  Brown. His real name's Hayashi, but someone  started calling him Charlie because  they thought he looked like Charlie  Brown. They've all got American  nicknames because its easier for me  to remember... they were just out in  L.A. last month doing a shoot with  John... that guy's Mr.Valentine,  he's the art director of their  magazine, I don't even know his real  name, or why I call him that. Hi. How's california? Good. Good... I like your swimming pool. Thanks, you guys should come back  sometime. Yes. Kawaii. What do you feel like singing, Bob? You bite your nails? I could cut the ones that are left  for you. Hans?  Nice to meet you. I don't want to go home. Hello, darling. Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it. That sounds great � can you hold  on... What Zoe? I don't want it. Well, you have to have something for  breakfast. Do you want cereal? No. Just trying to get her to eat  something...I'm glad you're having  fun. Well, that's good, I have to get the  kids off for school.  Can I call you  in a little while? Ok, well... I love you. Good-night. It's Charlotte. Thanks for getting me back in one  piece. Do you want to have some breakfast? OK, see you downstairs. Hey look, it's Sausalito. I think he kind of liked me...Is  that so hard to imagine? How'd a Japanese guy get a name like  Hans? Do you remember when we met at the  bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo. Really? Did I scowl at you? I don't remember. Why do they switch the r's and l's  here? Let's never come here again, because  it would never be as much fun. Did you see Hiromix last night dancing  with Bambi? Oh.  Well... they were dancing on  the couch with that weird English  guy who kept talking about hanging  out with the Sex Pistols on Kings  Road... Oh, for her show? Oh. I know. I'm stuck. Does it get easier. Yeah? But look at you. I just don't know what I'm supposed  to be. I thought maybe I wanted to  be a writer... but I hate what I  write, and I tried taking pictures,  but John's so good at that, and mine  are so mediocre... and every girl  goes through a photography phase,  like horses, you know dumb pictures  of your feet... But, I'm mean. And marriage, does that get easier? Did that help? Did you learn anything? Oh. That's too scary. No one ever tells you that... That's nice. My parents were always  traveling, they weren't around so  much. In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador  to France in the eighties, so we  went to school in Paris for a few  years... but we mostly lived in D.C.,  and they were never around... and  then I moved to Los Angeles when  John and I got married... it's so  different there. John thinks I'm so snotty. I know, but that's what you like  about me. Why do you have to be with your  opposite, why cant similar people be  together? You made it. What's that? How old is she? Oh, she'll love it. Fuck off. I don't know, I think maybe I broke  it? I knocked into something the  other day... It's bad isn't it? You think so? Bob, it's me. So, we got you on an earlier flight,  but I really think you should think  about staying for that talk show. You'll do it? Is that for me? Bob? Is this a bad time? (O.S.) It's really hard to reach  you... Did you get the carpet samples?  I like the burgundy. It's just carpet. What are you talking about? Is there anything I can do? What? Alright? Fine. Why don't you just stay there, and  you can have it everyday. I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe,  I'll talk to you later. Are you going  to be Ok? Hi Bob, it's Charlotte... how are  you doing today?... I'm going to  meet Charlie and those guys at this  place called Orange around ten...  come meet us if you get this... How long have you been here? C'mon, let's go. Working. Yeah. No. Isn't it weird there are no street  names in Tokyo... you'd think a city  like this would have street names...  you need a map to get anywhere...  look, there are no signs... Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone?  I'm not sure...I'm going to go to  Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you  when I get back. Hope it's going  good... I love you, bye. Rough night? I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want  to come walk around? Oh, I guess you're busy, huh. Hello, Bob, it's me. It's Lydia, your wife. Fine. Is it going ok? Do you want to- Do you want to talk to  Zoe? Zoe, come say hello to your father... I guess she's busy. When are you coming home? Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't  forget. Ok, well, travel safely. See you  soon. You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan  after 2 o'clock. Did you know that? The Jazz singer? The red-head? Well, I guess she's more around your  age...  You guys could talk about  things in common, like growing up in  the fifties. I can't tell the difference? A coke. Around. They're not going to play the whole  album, are they? That lunch was the worst, huh. When are you leaving? I'm going to miss you. Well, I mean it more now. I know. But, it doesn't last, you  have to go back sometime. I don't know, it just doesn't, reality  changes things....we can't stay here  forever, unless maybe we started a  Jazz band. 54? Hi, Bob. Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down. E Ok, see you in a second. You're leaving? Just saying good-bye to everyone  before you leave? That's it? You're leaving right now? Well... have a good flight. Ok, bye. I'll miss you.
