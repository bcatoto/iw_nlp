Lucky girl. I know. Go. Please. Go. Just go. It's okay, just leave it. I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom. I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference. I'm not convinced you should be happy. Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time. So I've heard. No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town. You must be Edward Bloom. Promise me you'll come back. How are you gonna make it without your shoes? And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all. I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38. How old are you? It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her. Was she nekkid? What did she look like? Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale. No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else. Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game. Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie? Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour. This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him. I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward. Like this. I wasn't expecting you. Oh. Oh.I like your stories. You were talking about your wedding. Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty? I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding. Oh, so this is a tall tale? I never knew. Please? Can I take your picture? Stop. No, I understand. That's terrible. What were you dreaming about? Hi. How are you feeling? Really. I do. I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to... I need to lie down for a bit. I'll help you. I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible. Yes. Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett. I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him. You're not. But it's not true. Do you love him? Do you love your father? Mmm, what? But it's romantic. What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that. You never told me how your parents met. I talked with your father last night. I'm going with you. I'm going with you. You need to go. It's bad.I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern. How can I convince you to stop? You don't even know me. How did you get so many? Daffodils? But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you. I'm sorry. I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking. Do you like it, being pregnant? I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork. I'm going to check on him. I'm going to get started on dishes. We'll have to pick up a copy. Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it. Thank you. I'll bet you need to -- Yes. Thank you. That's okay? I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he... In case he wakes up, one of us should be there. Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place. I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it. Yes? He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him. Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication. Do you know who that is? Was she one of your teachers? Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important. Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now. I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all. Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man. The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that. No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two. Would you say you understand Josephine? Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know. Yes. Of course. Really! That's wonderful. You don't talk about those things. Not yet. He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat. He's up with your father. You didn't need to do that. You just didn't. Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport. How did you get here?
