Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything. I thought you wanted Zammito? They're supposed to be evidence. That's why Bastaldi set this up. Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI. Zero. That's all I know. Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors. Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito. I don't know. I know they won't be home tonight. No. 145 Ridgeroad Way. Yes. No, I didn't. You can use my car. There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom. They don't have a wine list. Vincent Bastaldi is in jail. Stick around and find out. After last night I could say the same for you. Sounds boring. What are you doing? I'm sorry things went so wrong today. Can't sleep? The lucky ones. I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass. Sorry. I didn't mean to pry. You got it in a bar? That's how you get to know someone. Did it hurt when you got it? It looks old. Did you get it a long time ago? Did she break your heart? Casandra. Old girlfriend? They're not nice people. The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information. So, how did you get hooked up with these guys? It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it. You like shoes? Take a nap. Tonight. I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.Yeah -- you do that. You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table. Why are you here? Okay. How much? Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means. -- Super what? Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties? You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States. Can I offer you something. A drink? Coffee? When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family. Good. I'm good. Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her. Yes. You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems. Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage. I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed. He missed three weeks. You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you. Uh, no -- Someone else coming? Supernumerary. It means better than expected. I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary. He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off. And nothing. He's just feeling us out. Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse. No, I'm good, Angelo. Great fuckin' song. Can you believe that guy? What a moron. Oh, I'm sorry. Just find them! If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you? You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me. Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me. Everything. Everything. Yeah, French guys from France. They were all French guys. Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards. That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate. What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that? What'd I say to him? I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you. What happened? Get in the car. I said a clean break. How's my brother? Fuck me? Fuck you! And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here. The hell it is. Yeah. It's mine. Okay. Okay. For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this? Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here? What's this? What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that. Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you. I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day. Yeah. I mean besides that. They treating you all right? Food okay? So, I just come by to see how you're doin'? That's good. That's what a stand-up guy does. She seems pleasant enough. That's why we're only breaking one arm. -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine. Break his arm.
