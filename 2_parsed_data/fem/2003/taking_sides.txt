Yes. Yes. Three months. My father was one of the officers  in the plot against Hitler. They  arrested the plotters and their  families. Yes. She suffered longer. She was  in Ravensbruck. Major... There have been messages for you. A Lieutenant David Wills called  from the Allied Kommandatura  Cultural Affairs office in  Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is. Then there have been three calls  from Dr. Furtw�ngler wanting to  know when you wish to see him. I  did not speak to him personally... Oh yes, Major, I have recordings  of all his symphonies. I kept them  safe during the bombing. My  favourite is the Seventh Symphony. But... he only wrote nine, Major. No. Ours was damaged. The names of the members of the  Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since  1934 together with their  questionnaires.  Major, what am I  to tell Dr. Furtw�ngler? I'm sorry. It works!  Hallelujah! Herr Rudolf Werner. My father. No, no, no, I give you my word. I  was never a member of the Nazi  Party. Never. I am in the percussion  section. I play the timpani. Anyway, they would never have  allowed it. My brother was married  to a Jewess, may she rest in peace.  And Goebbels said... ...please take this down carefully,  because it's most important,  Fraulein? Straube. Straube? Are you by any chance  related to Colonel Joachim Straube? My father. He was... he was a great hero. Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said,  'There's not a single filthy Jew  left in Germany on whose behalf  Dr. Furtw�ngler has not intervened.'  No, no one could have been less of  a Nazi than Dr. Furtw�ngler. He was forced to do that. But he  refused to give the Nazi salute in  front of Hitler. He kept his baton  in his hand, you can't salute with  a baton in your hand. No, we...we played on the evening  before the Rally. Yes, Dr. Furtw�ngler was absolutely  clear about this: politics and art  must be kept separate. Well, it's hard to explain. I can  only tell you from my own  experience. Soon after I joined  the orchestra, we were rehearsing  the Third Symphony of Beethoven,  the Eroica. There are several rather  difficult passages for the timpani.  One particular crescendo. During  the break, I asked how he wanted  it played. He was studying his  score. He didn't look up. He said,  'Just watch me.'  So, of course, I  did. I never stopped watching him.  The moment came. And suddenly, he  turned to me and our eyes were  locked. There was something in his  look that...  that simply demanded  the crescendo. I shall never forget  his look. It was a moment of... of  magic. Yes. I don't know what you mean, Major. That's because you had a proper  upbringing. Oh! And don't wave your hands about! And no elbows on the table! And talking is talking! Well, I  think we better get on. Straube. My father. Major, Major... he's here ... Dr. Furtw�ngler. Straube. Major Arnold's office. Yes, he is. It's Major Richards for Lieutenant  Wills. Dr. Furtw�ngler. Maybe you can have a look at this. What does he mean, too correct? Don't see me to my door, there's  no need. Well, sleep well. Excuse me, Major. I found this on  Helmuth Rode. You remember? The  second violinist? Look, he's  Austrian not German. But it's this  that's more important, I think... When he made his decision, he  couldn't have known everything.  Especially not the way people like  you do, who've returned from exile  and feel that you have a right to  pass judgement. Because you are  blameless, you think you know best  who is a sinner and who deserves  forgiveness. But you have no idea  how people lived here. I don't know. But you and I already  know that he has saved lives. Bruckner's Seventh, Major. Of course. I'm sorry but I have to leave.  I'll find other work. You'll have  to get someone else, that's all. I can't do this. It's not right. I have been questioned by the  Gestapo just like that. Just like  you questioned him. But he had no idea, a lot of people  had no idea. I only realised what  was really going on when I got  arrested. I would like to go now, please. 'Please remember that Dr.  Furtw�ngler risked his life to  help anyone who asked him. I  personally testify to having seen  literally hundreds of people lined  up outside his dressing room after  concerts to ask for his help. He  never turned anyone away. After he  heard me play... I am a violinist...  he gave me money because I was  unable to feed myself or my family  and then he helped me to escape to  Sweden. He helped countless people  in similar ways.' My father only joined the plot  when he realised that we could not  win the war.  She cries quietly.
