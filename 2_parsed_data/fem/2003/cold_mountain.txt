Ada, how are you settling in? Are  you liking the farm? Very much. It's beautiful country. So listen -- if you would say hello  to one of these fools, I'll get a  field cleared this weekend. Anyone? Like a forfeit? No. Him in particular, up in the  rafters. Been pressing me all morning. Hello. I'm Ada Monroe. Inman? W. P. Inman. If you were to take a glass of  lemonade your friends might stop  staring. Inman. And what do you do? Clear fields? So, was there something in particular  you wished to say to me? That's a fine looking thing. I've been missing it. Thank you, by the way. Inman's down in the bottom field,  clearing his debt. Oh dear. And then he had nothing to  say. He was happy. Really? Are men so different in Charleston? Men? I don't know. I don't even know  what a woman should be like. In  Charleston I was called a thistle,  twice, by two different men. Both of  them -- they were hunting for a  simile, what was I like -- and thistle  came right to them. If you're saying you might like him,  why not go down and say hello. Were you planning to come inside? There's a good fire going. Somebody said you were enlisting. Are you? If there's a mountain we'll all climb,  if there's an ocean we'll all drown. Did you get a picture made? A tintype, with your gun and your  courage on display. I don't know you. I'm taking a drink over to the negroes  in the barn. Mr. Inman is more comfortable  outdoors. Perhaps we might take a  walk. Well, you have your war. But then who'll be waiting for you? And then there'll be a coffee or  two, a brandy or two... I found you this book. William  Bartram. They tell me it's good. I  think he writes about these parts,  the author, so... And this... I'm not smiling in it. I don't know  how to do that, hold a smile, so now  I'm solemn... What? What? Every time you see the doctor you  get melancholy. He gives you alcohol and you get  emotional. Yes. But then I've tried counting  the number of words which passed  between Mr. Inman and me. Is that a bonfire? So close to the  barns. What's going on? No, Daddy, it's not real. I'll get help. Keep away from the flames. I'm sorry, you want water? I'm sorry. I don't know what he's  saying. Pigeon River. Is that a place? Cold  Mountain? Amen. That was the last of the ham. I have to learn how to cook. I can't have people coming here and  cooking for me! I'm not sorry, but I don't know how  we'll get through another winter. Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with  you! Daddy, come inside before you drown! Dear Mr. Inman... It's come to you by way of Virginia. It's not too recent -- written this  past winter. I'm afraid I can't read  who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman, -- I'm still waiting, as I promised  I would, but I find myself alone and  at the end of my wits -- -- at the end of my wits, so now I  say to you, plain as I can, come  back to me. Come back to me is my  request. Then something I can't read,  something, come back to me. Is there a letter for me? Nothing -- we're getting no post  through at all -- although if you  slip out back the material you ordered  has arrived. If folks knew I was taking deliveries  from the North. I know. Thank you so much. The sooner we lose this war the  better. Already one boy gone, another  with his leg took off at the knee.  That's enough. What do you hear? All I know is they say not one boy  in ten from these mountains is coming  home again and most of them are  deserters. Thank you. Didn't somebody try? No. But not to volunteer for the war? You've got no spleen. I'd really prefer it if you didn't  do that. I was raised in the good manners of  the South where a gentleman doesn't  enter a house with a woman alone. I'm sleeping fine. Should I imagine you are dead and,  that it is to your spirit I am  writing? No word from you in all  this time. If you receive this please  know I am here and warring, too,  with a faint heart. Ada! Ada, It's Sally. Poor soul. She's got nobody and  nothing and three hundred acres of  misery. Ada... You're skinny as a whippet, girl --  you're coming indoors with me. I can't. I'm not -- I need to clean  some clothes. Great God, you ever looked at my  husband! I can't get him to wear  decent Church clothes Christmas  morning. Hang on to me, the wind'll  blow you over. Don't go back to that dark house.  There's a bed here, least till our  boys get home. I was saying to Sally, I wasn't  expecting to be visiting, so... I don't expect - What about your people in Charleston? There are no people. And no money.  My father had some bonds and  investments. They're worthless now,  of course, the war has... they're  not worth anything. I love it here. In spite of  everything. I know it ain't rightly Christian,  but it's what folks do, like when  they dangle a needle over the belly  to see if you're carrying a boy or a  girl. What kind of mirror? I don't know. I tried many a time, never saw a  dickybird. You all right? Yesterday I found myself crouched  over a well like a mad woman, which  I suppose I have become -- and staring down into its secrets,  I thought I saw you there, walking  back to me -- -- or wished I did. That cow wants milking. If that letter ain't urgent, the cow  is -- is what I'm saying. I don't know you. Old Lady Swanger says you need some  help. Here I am. I need help, I need, I do need help,  but I need a laborer -- there's  plowing and rough work and -- I think  there's been a misunderstanding. What's the rake for? The rake? Ain't for gardening, that's for sure.  Number one -- you got a horse I can  plow all day. I'm a worker. Number  two there's no man better than me  cause there's no man around who ain't  old or full of mischief. I know your  plight. My plight? Am I hard to hear cause you keep  repeating everything. I'm not looking  for money, never cared for it and  now it ain't worth nothing. I expect  to board and eat at the same table.  I'm not a servant. Do you get my  meaning? You're not a servant. People'll have to empty their own  night jars, that's my point. Right. And I'm not planning to work while  you watch neither. Right. Is that a yes or a no? Yes. There's half the day yet. Let's make  a start. My name's Ruby. I know your  name. The rake: there's a rooster devil,  I'm sure of it. He's Lucifer himself.  I go near him he's at me with his  spurs. I despise a flogging rooster. Where  is he? Let's put him in a pot. Ada? Ada? You up? Yes. It's still dark. Tell the cows that. It's late. I have to eat something. Then you have to get up earlier. What's that? A novel. You want to carry a book carry one  you can write in -- -- we got our own story. Called Black  Cove Farm: a catastrophe. I can spell it, too. C-a-t-a-s-t-r-o- phe. Learned the same place you did,  in the schoolroom. That's one of the  first words they taught me. Ruby  Thewes, you are a ca-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h- e... You mucking out? Three years I was in school before  my daddy -- saying God rest his soul  is like wishing him what he had in  life, cause he lived to rest, he was  born tired -- before my daddy decided  there was better use for my backside  than have it sat all day in front of  a blackboard. Number One -- layout a winter garden  for cool season crops: turnips,  onions, cabbage, greens. Number Two: patch the shingles on  the barn roof. Do we have a maul and  froe? Maul? M-a-u-l. I have no idea. Number three: clay crocks for  preserves. Tomatoes. Beans. Jams. Clear and turn this field. No harm  done letting it go fallow, now we'll  do well. Number fifteen Sixteen. Number sixteen: let's get a martin  colony going in the Gourd House.  Keep away crows. You got one thing  in abundance on this farm and that's  crows. What's a Gourd House? There's survival. On them trees. You got a cider press or would that  be wishing on a blessing? Actually, yes, I think we do. Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in  the woods? No. What? No. We bought our hams. There's a world more to a hog than  the two hams! Lard, for example,  we'll need plenty -- The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's  laundry. I can feel you shutting your eyes. What's this wood? I don't know. Locust? Where's North? North is, North is -- Name me three herbs growing wild on  this farm. I can't! I can't! All right? I can  talk about farming in Latin. Will  that do? I can read French. I know  Harmony and Counterpoint. I know my  Bible. I can name the principal rivers  of Europe, but don't ask me to name  one stream in this county. I can  embroider, but I can't darn, I can  arrange cut flowers, but I can't  grow them. If a thing has a function,  if I might do something with it, it  wasn't considered suitable. Why? Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty  much everything to do with me. This fence is about the first thing  I've ever done that'll produce an  actual result. So you never wrapped your legs around  this Inman? For five dollars I wouldn't give a  parched man a dipper of this  riverwater. This look like a ferry? My Daddy's  dead, or gone off to the Federals,  don't matter which. I'm the way across  now. Nothing but the mighty Cape Fear  River, is all. Nobody crosses this water unless  they're running from someplace. Some  cross one way, some the other: makes  no difference, they're all running.  You want to wait for your friends? Let's go. I'm saving for a cowhide, and when I  get it I aim to get a saddle made,  and when I get me a saddle I'll save  for a horse, and when I got a horse  I'll throw on the saddle, and then  you won't see my sorry ass round  this swamp again. Catfish. 'gator. Keep your hand in  the boat. Already looks like some  critter chewed his neck. Thirty more dollars, we can go to  the cabin. I'll pull this dress over  my head. Agricola poetis viam non monstrat. Which means? The farmer does not point out the  road to a poet. Which means? Should be the other way  round Which means, I suppose, which means  the poet should know where he's going. It's no wonder you're helpless and  hopeless if it takes this long to  fix your hair. Say some more. Terra mutata non mutat mores. It's appalling what's in my head. It's appalling what's in my head? No, it means: A change of place does  not change a character. Well that's surely true even in  English. You can keep those earrings. We can't keep anything. I have to keep the bangles. They  were my mother's. Well that's all. The rest is for  trading. Else they can bury you in  your finery. You're done. Good God! Okay. I like it. Takes two minutes. That's what I  like. How much do you love that piano? We're careful we'll get through the  winter now. I made old man Roy give  me ten of those sheep on account of  I said they were so small put together  they were no bigger than six proper  sheep. My father always wanted sheep on  this land. I'm sorry you had to lose your piano.  I cut off my hair once, for money.  My daddy got two dollars for it.  Made a wig for a rich feller in  Raleigh. Stobrod called himself a musician --  my daddy -- he could play six tune  on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead  at Petersburg. I was like his goat  or some creature tethered to a post.  He left me once, up the mountains. I  was eight. He was gone over two weeks. Oh Ruby. I was all right! He'd walk forty  miles for liquor and not forty inches  for kindness. And your mother? Never met her. We're the same in  that regard. He said she was -- he  told me a thousand stories -- she  was a wolf or an indian or a donkey.  Don't say much for him, except you  know he'd be fast to work up a sweat  on a tree if he thought there was  pleasure in it. There's cows to milk. If they want to get in a tub there's  an hour before food. That's battered flesh. I could work a finger in there. He's shy, ain't he? I want to poke my thumb in his holes. Lila says supper's up. Hey! S'me. Come on you -- get! He's mine. You can go rub yourself  off on the Preacher. Gonna make him hug me till I grunt. Hey! You want to see what Mamma's got for  you? That's good. Ain't that sweet? You just get on and ride me all the  way to China. You shy? You need a hand? Let's have a look see what we can  muster. Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes! Look at  you both! Look at us both what? Like a coupla scarecrows after a  thunderstorm. We need a scarecrow, birds eating up  half our winter garden. Sally's right. We should both stop  toiling and stand a while with our  arms stretch out. I'll volunteer. We got something for you. For all your kindness. Coffee. And a  pie. That's real coffee. It ain't hickory  and dirt. Thank you both. Ruby, I look forward to this. We all  do. Esco and me. She made it. I made it. Good God in Heaven. I'm still alive. We'll be getting along. I know Esco's going to be real sorry  he missed you. You all take care. That strike you as odd? What? Stood at her front door? Sally? Number one -- I know that woman all  my life. I never stood outside her  house -- she'd invite a wolf inside  if it knocked on the door. Perhaps, I don't know, perhaps she  was busy. Number two -- Old Man Swanger was  inside that house: I could smell his  pipe burning. Number three -- look  at these fields. What about them? We came by here a week ago, they  were waist high in hay. Mas? Your curls is all gone. Someone's been in the corncrib. You sure? It's a coon or possum. Scratched out  a fist hole in the side. This place!  I'm telling you -- we grow, others  eat. I'll go into town, take the  last of the cider and trade for a  trap. What? We got some critter stealing our  corn. You know it. Ruby... I'm not stopping, Sally. I'm not  snooping neither. Just you should  know Teague and his boys are lurking  down by Pigeon River, the old mill. You tell Ada that was a good pie. Mind that Billy, he's the jealous  kind. Pay no attention to me. What happened  to your head? And your neck? You're the color of a cadaver. I'll  fix you. I can fix you up. Debts, fighting -- them words don't  mean much round here. For the record,  I'm a female of the species. The hat's a nice touch. You're quiet. I cried for my Daddy. I dressed up  the scarecrow in his suit and he  came back, his arms out, said you  never cried enough, you never cried  enough. Well now you did. Then I thought, it's not my Daddy,  it's my sweetheart. I saw him once  that way, when I looked down Sally's  well. So I dressed the scarecrow in  the dress I wore the day he left. In  case his spirit flies over looking  out for me. That looks terrible. Cabbages. I bargained like Lucifer. We can  make all kinds of good eating. Such as? Cabbage. Slaw, sauerkraut, cabbage  soup, fried cabbage, stuffed  cabbage... What's that? I can't get this damn thing off her. Dear Lord in heaven. Ada, I can't get this off her! What darling? What? She's saying don't bother. Wait! There's someone down there. I think  it's Esco. This world won't stand long. God  won't let it stand this way long. Not long enough. What they going to do? Cut short my  young life? Sit down before you fall  down. What year are we? '63? I'd say twenty six years. I could move on anytime. I've seen  most of the world anyway, Richmond  in the North, south almost to  Charleston. You're going somewhere  or you are somewhere, what's the  difference? I've learned a person can survive  off pretty much of a goat. I can't  abide a chicken, but a goat gives  you company and milk and cheese and  then, when you need it, good meat. So you've been fighting? He gave it a try, to look at you. See I think there's a plan. There's  a design. For each and every one of  us. You look at nature, a bird flies  somewhere, picks up a seed, shits  the seed out, a plant grows. Bird's  got a job, seed's got a job. Take one of these now with your food. Swallow it. If you die I'll give you  your money back. Our minds aren't made to hold on to  the particulars of pain, the way we  do bliss. What is? What's her name? And is she waiting for you? Now drink this. It visits the pain.  And you'll sleep. I hope you found it. That's the laudanum getting to you.  That's good. Say something more. Raise that up for me. It's a man. What is? Raiding our corn. Got him in the  trap. That's him yelping. You're not going to shoot him! I don't want him to shoot me. Can you fire this thing? Yes. Listen up -- you got a barrel trained  on your rear-end. You got a weapon? Unbelievable! Stobrod Thewes. What? That's my daddy... Just so's you know -- you're not  eating inside. Number One -- they  hang people round here for taking in  deserters. Number two -- even if  they gave out prizes -- you'd still  eat outside. I'm what? You'd be scarred. You'd be really  scarred if I hadn't wrapped them  trap teeth in sacking. Which was her  idea. Good God! Hey! Let's agree: you beat me, you  abandoned me, you ignored me, you  beat me some more -- all of that is  better than Ruby with the eyes that  sparkle! You were an asshole. Get him out of here! You're all set. Ain't you got a proper coat? I'm not Ruby's employer. Nobody. I'll make up food for you, you come  Sundays before it's light, I'll leave  it behind the Old Frazier Mill. He is so full of manure, that man,  we could lay him on the dirt and  grow another one just like him. So that's Stobrod Thewes. It is and that's the last you'll see  of him. That's medicine and goatmeat. You're  sick of both. And that's just for show, or -- if  you can get close enough -- a wild  turkey. Get on back where you came from! My love for Heathcliff resembles the  eternal rocks beneath -- a source of little visible delight,  But necessary. She ain't gonna marry Linton, is  she? She said -- whatever our souls  are made of his and mine are the  same. You can't say that and then  marry Linton. We'll find out. Okay. Tomorrow. I'm not waiting until tomorrow. Ruby, I'm falling asleep. Little visible delight, but necessary.  I like that... I've got a rifle. There's some beans and corn pone,  all I got. You better come in. I'm alone here, as you can see, with  my baby. I need to believe you mean  no harm. I don't want it. I had my way they'd  take metal altogether out of this  world. Every blade, every gun. He cries. I don't know. He cries a  lot. My man is dead. He took his  wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw  his boy. It's pretty much what you'll get if  you knock on any door of this war.  Man dead, woman left. It's mean food but it's hot. I need to feed this man, if you could  look away. Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders  took them. Made me kill our own dog  on the porch. That poor creature  watched over me. Nothing left now  save a hog and couple of chickens to  live off till spring. I'll have to  kill that hog and make sense of the  flesh and divisions which is something  I never did. I'm not asking. I'm Sara. My baby's Ethan. You look about his size. He was  another man straight up and down. I don't even have a blanket. I'll leave you the lamp. They fit? I'll say good night. Will you come inside? Could you do something for me? Do  you think you could lie here, next  to me, and not need to go further? I don't want you to. There's snow in the air. Don't sleep here. It's bitter, they could stop one  night. They stop one night, they'll want to  stop two. Maybe. The war's over in a month. He said that a month ago. It started off being over in a month. Merry Christmas. Pangle. Georgia. 'Night. She's an original. What kind of name's Georgia? It's where he comes from, it's not  his name. I know that's meant to be the ugliest  state under the heavens. Why do you care what his name is? What's that cluster of Stars? Orion. What about them shaped like a  wishbone? That's Taurus the bull, and that's  Gemini and that's Orion's big dog,  Canis Major. Listen to her, Sal. She's turned  into a highland girl. I could always name the stars, Ruby,  that was never my problem. I love you darling. In case that big  old sky falls on our heads. And I  love you, too. Sal. It's sad, Sal. It's a c-a-t-a-s-t-r- o-p-h-e. Get out of here, quick! Federals are coming. They find you  here it'll go bad on all of us. No, my baby. Please no! Just get. My baby's sick! Cover him up! He's  shaking! Have some pity. I got nothing. I swear. Yes! Take me inside! Let's all go  inside! Take my baby inside and then  we'll do whatever you want. There's nothing! You take that hog  I'm as good as dead. Cover up my  boy! Good? Do you think he's dead? Who? This snow. Isn't it supposed to fall  with bad news? Bad news is girls get working. I'm  going to round up the animals. This'll settle. What d'you reckon? Think we could  eat this? Don't taste much like venison. I told Georgia he can stop here,  sleep in the barn. He's got nothing  inside him. He'd walk out of here  and die in the snow. He can milk the cows. I was worrying  about that. It'll be dark in a couple  of hours. I's ten hours climb from  here. He's drawn a map. Okay. You know these fools stayed the night  in the Mill? That's Stobrod -- he  can't do one good thing without adding  the bad. Left tracks in the snow all  the way up for them Home Guards to  follow. That's a sign says shoot me! Ruby, I'm so sorry. We should get going. Every piece of this is a man's  bullshit. They call this a war a  cloud over the land, but they made  the weather. Then they stand in the  rain and say: shit! It's raining! If I cry one tear for my Daddy I  stole it off a crocodile. I don't understand. Maybe Teague's took him. They did  that with the Swanger boys -- didn't,  they? -- dragged them into town,  then strung them up as warning...  it's snowed since, so I can't read  the story on the ground. Let's dig. Ruby! Ruby! He's still breathing! God damn! Daddy; Daddy -- it's Ruby.  Don't you die on me again. He's still breathing! Pack a pan full of snow. I need good  clean water, boiled up. Let's get him home. We have herbs  there and it's warm. He'll die first. He's got hardly no  blood left in him. He'll die lying here. There's a place further on up. Used  to be. Old Cherokee place. There's  good water right by it. This horse is weary. He's ready to  give up the ghost. Good boy. That's warmer, isn't it. I'm getting firewood. That wood -- that sound when it burns  that mean more snow? Yes, it do, country girl. Turn round and go back where you  came from. I do not know you. Inman? You'd better come with me. Ruby, this is Inman. Congratulations, I should send you  out with a shotgun more often. He  looks as he needs sleep. Be my guest. You shot or something? Hungry? He woke up. Stobrod? Said -- your mommy's name was Grace  then closed his eyes again. He's asleep. They both are. I'm not surprised. Your man looks  played out. I saw him. I realize now. Saw him when? In Sally Swanger's well. A tunnel of  trees. The man like a black smudge  in the snow, the sun behind him. Well there you are. Funny thing is it wasn't the same.  The image. It wasn't snowing. And in  the well, he was, as if he were  falling. You probably don't remember it right. I remember it exactly. There were  crows, these black crows flying  towards me. I thought I was seeing  him fall. Instead I was seeing him  come back to me. All this while I've  been packing ice around my heart.  How will I make it melt? Better get a fire going. I've got big plans for that farm.  Got a vision in my mind of how that  Cove needs to be. I know you have. There's not a thing we can't do  ourselves. I couldn't sleep. I can't see your face. Did you get my letters? I must have sent 100. Did you write  to me? No, it's -- But how did I keep you? We barely  knew each other. A few moments. Your boots, one polished, one not  yet polished. I'm playing a piano and you're  standing outside. Every day of my waiting. Number one -- shut this door, it's  freezing. Number two -- shut that door, it's  freezing. I'm laying on my back, with my fingers  poked in my ears trying to shut out  who's got a bag of diamonds and who's  got boots needs polishing, If you  want to get three feet up a bull's  ass listen to what sweethearts whisper  to each other. In fact, if you're going to wimble  all night I'm going to sleep in with  him. Now I can't see anything. I don't think Ruby's vacating my hut  so that you can sleep in a different  one. Come in. Whatever comes to pass between you  and me, I want Ruby to stay in Black  Cove. As long as she wants. And if she  never leaves I'll be glad. And you understand she's my friend,  she's not a hired hand and she doesn't  empty a night jar unless it's her  own. This war's made some things pointless.  It's hard to imagine a wedding. I  think even my father would recognize  that. Isn't there's some religion where  you just have to say I marry you,  three times, and then you're man and  wife. No, I think it's I divorce you three  times and then you're not married  anymore. You waited enough. I certainly did.  I marry you. I marry you. I marry  you. I'm sorry about the way I look. In  these clothes. And there are so many buttons. Will you turn your back? We can all go together. He's right. You be safe. And am I the fly in this story, or  the cow? You'd have found some other fool to  rescue you. If you say a thing and then cough  it's a lie. Daddy, stay on that horse,  and don't lose him or sell him. We'll  need him on the farm. I hope that Georgia boy's been seeing  to the animals. I thought you were thinking on him! I was not. I was thinking on swollen  udders -- and before you say same  difference... I'm saying nothing. Miss lovey-dovey! You bring that lamb outside. What are you doing! He came out dead, love. Don't kill him! I'm not going to kill him. But we  have to try something or else he's  going to die. Isn't that a small mercy. Hot hot hot hot hot!!! Grace Inman, nobody said eat. Mr. Thewes... For good friends, good food, good  family: for all our blessings -- Oh  Lord we thank thee. Amen.
