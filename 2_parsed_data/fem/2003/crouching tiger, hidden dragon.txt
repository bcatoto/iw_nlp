This spells trouble. Autumn is coming. I'll shut the windows for you. Go to bed then. Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon. God knows what the future will bring. Don't invite danger into your father's house. She's one of those. Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind. I heard you met Shu Lien today. I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10. You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu. But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened! Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from. You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain. You know... you've gone as far as you can go. I hid my skills so as not to hurt you. You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols! I owe you nothing. Shut up! That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where would I go? I'll never live as a thief! Why are you still here? You killed a policeman. You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family. He is my defeated foe! So what if I don't? Don't bother. Long. I have a guest. It will be just the same. Enough! I'm tired. I'm tired now. I'll socialize with whomever I please. Do you know her? Put them down. Please sit. Spare your energy. I'll be back! She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison. It goes straight to the heart. Don't be a sore loser. Go ahead. Take your pick. I'll wait. Go ahead. Come and get it if you can. What do I care? You were never a real friend anyway. But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy? You're working together to set me up! I'm leaving! Where is he now? You know about Lo? They forced me to marry! You, sister... I was just passing by and wondered how you were. I'm just borrowing some clean clothes. I'm not staying. You say she killed a policeman? Don't distance us. From now on, let's be like sisters. Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's. No, really? About you and Li Mu Bai? Am I? I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read. Like you and Li Mu Bai. I guess I'm happy to be marrying. But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness. I'm hardly doing a thing. The less I think of it the better. My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career. Please. Maybe it is. I wouldn't know. I'll write your name. Just for fun. I'm bored. I've missed you. No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were. You're not married, are you? You know what I mean. I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want. But you're just like the characters in the stories. I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way! It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free! Really? You're a sword fighter too? Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te? Exquisite! You said it belongs to... But I have had much practice. As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us. They'd let me play with their weapons. The scabbard is so beautiful. It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal! The antidote exists. She taught it to me. The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare. Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you. Never! Give it back! All right. If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you. What do you want? Only the sword will settle this. Not another lecture! On guard! Make a wish, Lo. Do you remember the legend of the young man? Don't ever come back. Go. If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy. Keep it safe. Return it to me when we are together again. Don't send me back! Let them look. So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars. And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit. He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb. Give it back. Give me back my comb. By the way, I'm a real Manchurian. It's mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand. You coward! My comb! Give it back! You shouldn't have come. Lo?Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same. A female criminal! Now that's news! A murderer? But don't be too lenient. That's good. Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing. I heard Sir Te lost something. And now Madame Te's not feeling well... Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts. She's being so considerate.Father! Let me avenge my mother's death. What does it say? Father! We must avenge mother!I didn't have the heart. Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night. How's the arm? Still sore? Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry! You can't die! Tell us what poison you used! You can't die! Tell us the antidote! You can't let Li Mu Bai die! Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing. Don't touch it! That's Li Mu Bai's sword. How dare you accuse us? I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family. And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt. Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him. We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine! Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain. He really loves you. Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution. Go back to them first. Then you can decide about Lo. Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like. If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice. You can run from marriage, but not your parents. I'll give them to you. Here you must be in proper attire. Yes, from the West. He went undercover and and followed her here, Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage. I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties. His name was Meng Si Zhao. He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy. After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together. Our feelings for each other grew stronger. But how could we dishonor Meng's memory? So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it. But I have never tasted it. Yes. Did you know I was once engaged to be married? Do you think so? Let me tell you a story. You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family. Thank you for seeing me. I hear your wedding day is near. You must be overwhelmed by the preparations. You write gracefully. Calligraphy is so similar to fencing. You're doing calligraphy? How so? You're probably right. What do you think? So I heard. Congratulations. It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it? Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books? Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is. Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long. Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete. Certain moves, however, call for a sword. You're too young to understand. My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it to Sir Te as a gift. Beautiful but dangerous. Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire. It's 400 years old. The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal. Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it. Use it to meditate. Free yourself from this world as you have been taught. Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath. Do not waste it... for me. Save your strength. Mu Bai, hold on. Give me some hope... That can't be! Everything has an antithesis! Why not this? We followed Jade Fox. What happened? Not a bad idea. Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters. What about you? To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger. Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn't that real? Don't you want to see her again. You think Jade Fox will show up? I wish there were something more I could do to help you. It's not our affair. Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object. But Wudan does not accept women. She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us. In any case, it will all be over soon. You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry. I knew she would intrigue you. My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone. I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's. But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te. Then, why did you come? What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it? No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods. No, not yet... It was Bo, Sir Te's man. I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'. No. Be careful. Sir Te requires discretion. Official business is difficult enough. Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap. Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu? You always suspected she'd fled to the West. But something is going on at the Yu household. Join me once you have finished. I can wait for you in Peking. Come with me to Peking. You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times. So what will you do now? You use it justly, you're worthy of it. I don't understand. How can you part with it? It has always been with you. The Green Destiny Sword? You're giving it to Sir Te? We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking. What was it? You were enlightened? Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything. The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you. My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest. Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain. He said you were practicing deep meditation. Good. And how are you? Mu Bai...It's been too long. I doubt it. This thief... it very unusual... Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master. Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down. No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking. Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families. We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further. I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today. The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs. Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter? We must be careful. Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security. Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him. It might get Sir Te in trouble. But the sword could be in his compound. Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword? I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards. I don't know... Please, Sir Te, what is it? You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me. Please accept our thanks. Sir Te! It has brought him as much trouble as glory. Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
