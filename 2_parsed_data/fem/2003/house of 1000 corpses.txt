Please don't kill us, please don't kill us. Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down. Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think. Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love. I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous. Any cone, yeah... I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either. Cone. Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate? Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood. Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya. Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey. Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty. Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years. Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming. Who's your Daddy! Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year. Drink up, it's party time. Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming. I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat. Ma, Tiny's in. Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel. Tiny's home. Whoopie fucking doo. OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up. Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody? Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me? Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. A dead one. You're welcome. You sure do a lot of guessing. No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows? Yeah, come on. Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on. Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet. The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here. Almost there... are you in a hurry or something? Come on. OK. If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier. Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there. Oh yeah, the tree. Couple more miles up this road. Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing. Yeah, I'll do something. You shouldn't a done that. He walks, duh. I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV. I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch. You know... a couple of queers. Are you two gals all funny with each other? I was just wondering. I'd like to see that. No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals. What's this? Come on, bro. Let's go. Keep the change and get yourself a new name. Great story Goober, how much? I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya... ...Goober? Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean? Now, what makes you think that?Lock the fucking doors. I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless. Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous. That food... ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke. Yeah, showtime for what? I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles. Turn that fucking radio off! Honk at him. Scare him. Here he comes. What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business. Oh. You sure you don't need any help in there? How's he get around out here? How long is that gonna take? Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters. No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house... ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down. Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone? Help, help us. That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that. I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much. We've got get out of here, we got get out of here. You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted. This isn't funny, it's twisted. What are you laughing at? Shhhhhh. Really, now is not the time to make waves. Thank you. Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death. When you were outside with Bill. Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us. You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point? So what? Yeah? Why? So. Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree? Oh, yeah. Fuck, it's freezing. That seems likely. Ugh, what's that smell? Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun. I don't want to see that. Tickets for what? Huh? Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding. Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner. No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule. Don't be such a fucking smart ass. Can't Tiny drive us to a phone? Excuse me, may I please use your phone? Jesus Christ. Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there. Shhhhhh, quiet. What? I didn't hear anything. I don't know... about half an hour. Yeah, she said we looked queer. I can't believe... You got to be fucking joking. Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked. Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it. Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10. Scattered, smothered and covered. A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap. Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous. God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night... ...ugh, my back is killing me. I swear I've aged five years since this trip started. Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute. ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa? Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug. Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer. Rise and shine. Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.Why? You gonna do something about it? Take that, you fucking slut! Fucking redneck whore! Fucking great. Oh, wonderful. Fucking psycho. What the hell are you laughing about? Do you believe this fucking girl? What? Wondering what? Can I help you with something? Nice. The animals have got nothing to do with it. Drive through it! What are you doing! Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure? How much is a person supposed to stand? This is starting to make me real uncomfortable. Check this out. I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things. Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself. What! What? Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something. Then run him over, he'll move. Go around him. Why are we stopping? Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland. She looks like a freak. Should we stop? Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days. Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer. Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place. A couple hours! Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend. I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack. I still don't. I don't hear anything. Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio. What was that? How long has it been? She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that. I think I'm going fucking crazy. God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit. Don't even say it. She looks like she stinks. Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway. Maybe he's a cyborg. Geez, he never gets tired does he. Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me. If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl. I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it. It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal. Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's? Tell me about it. Aw, shit... I gotta pee anyway. Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap. I resign. No please, let me sit this one out. Sleeping. I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid. I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words. Enough with the stupid voices. What! You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something. That stupid hillbilly slut. God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch. You said it, not me. Just back up. Huh? Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain. Don't worry, I'm gone. Sorry. No, just a little too old. What are you doing? ...no, stop... please, please. Fuck you, you fucking freak! This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real. Where is he? Where's Bill? Why? Why are you doing this?Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting. Who's your Daddy! Enjoy your last night... ...where's Otis? No, I told you... Baby! Stop! Go tell him to get your Grandpa. What about R.J.? He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin. Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all. You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much. No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work. Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle. He should be back in a couple hours. That's nice. No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more. Aw, honey you know I can't do that. Bye sweety, we could of been great together. No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love. For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show. Firefly. Maybe. He's a real lady killer. I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya. Oh, really... ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen. So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks? What do they call you, sweety? His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J. I suggest you kids leave now. Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner. I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you. Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day. Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween. No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before... ...he looks familiar, is he on TV? Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform. Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all. I um... no, I don't think so... Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry. Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know. Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think? Well hello, officer. That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but... Wait, I want to say good-bye. Who's your Daddy! What should I do? I don't know. I only saw one. Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside. Grampa... watch the language.Enough talk, write. How's about you give me those same directions. Is that all... think real hard. And... What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going? Come on, get with the facts. You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours. What I need are some answers. Yep, I found something. God damn. Yep, I suppose it is. Just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not yet. Yeah, no mercy here. A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley. Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way? Thank you. Please, just a minute. Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something. I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl... ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her? My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon. I'm sure there's a logical explanation. Her part in this I can't figure... but I will. Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one. Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan. Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point. I'm Wydell... this is Naish. Mr. Willis? Over. Excuse me for a second. I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything. Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her. Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms. That must be him. Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop. Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help. Call the chief... We found 'em. Aw, fuck. I always favored the Hulk. How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point. Yeah... ...huh, what the hell are you talking about? I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different. Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
