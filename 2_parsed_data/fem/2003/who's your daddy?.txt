Then you better get in the water, before you get burned. Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces. Are you hungry? I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you. Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny. I mean, what do you think? Well? Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself. Remember dress up day? You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess. Which you pulled, hard! You know...take the pictures? I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now. I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear. I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible. Hi, Teddy Bear. Makes your shoulders look so big and broad. Great jacket, Teddy Bear. The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams. You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing! Oh, Ted, DUH. I smile at everyone since I got my braces off. I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS. Ted, have you lost your mind? Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom? If you don't have...I mean... And I was wondering. Well. The prom's coming up. You go first. Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?Well? This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom! Ted! Do something! Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here. After graduation...maybe we could go away together? Teddy? I was thinking. Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS. Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood. And who IS Ted Nelson? Who exactly ARE you? Don't worry. He found the chocolate room. Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping? That's me. I know. I'm Ginger. Miss April. Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy." It's your car. These are all your cars. The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again. Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear. Want a lesson? You do know how to drive? They're in the ignition, silly.So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything. Can you believe that was me? But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad. But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now. Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!But how can you respect yourself if you don't? I understand. Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it. Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours. They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them. Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar. It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again. Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation. We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can. I'm Helen McDole. Your father's executive secretary.Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism. That explains the emptiness that haunts me. New Hushpuppies don't make a new man. What gives, Don Corleone? You better. Let your fingers do the walking. I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief. Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening? I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board. Very ambitious. I like that. I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams. Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted. You think you're working with chimps here? Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades? You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts. I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly. I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia." That's hard to believe. Maybe someday. Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire. Not a chance. You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever. You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust. I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me. Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch. I'm very aural. That's refreshingly deviant. Wearing them? Or humping them? I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy. My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh. I'm trembling with excitement. Amen to that. You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood? I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati. Well? Where the hell are you? A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft. You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him. That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout. Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you. But you never do. I know. Then you'll see who's really holding on to you. Eventually you'll let go. It's incredibly simple. A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad. Your dad taught you everything. The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted. I doubt it. He phoned it in. Not "whatever." It's two different things. He didn't. He had it built. To the best hiding place in the world. Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in. You've got enough people kissing your ass. Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit. You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax. And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted. Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort. I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer. Life must be peachy on Planet Ted. Is this an gritty exposï¿½ or a candy ass press release? She said peanuts, you cretin. Interesting. I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist. Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew? Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps? "Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest. Then I'll write about YOU. I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account. Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago. Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there. In what sense? What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching? A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year. It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way. I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds. --Do it. I triple-dog-dare you. Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with. I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job. Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there. Is it true? Is ignorance bliss? Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof! So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after. We miss our family. We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that. Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family? You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire. We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest. Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance. Sweetheart, what is it? We can't accept it. It's much too expensive. Right, dear? We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning. Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you. Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much. But who would run the store? Like what? Oh. Goodness. But how would we pay our bills? You promise you'll finish school? Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes? Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive. What is all this? When are you coming home? Save it, honey. We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill. Did you have a nice flight? Are they taking good care of you? What about Charlie? You boys could make it a little adventure. That's part of growing up, honey. No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
