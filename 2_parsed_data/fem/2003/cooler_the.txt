Shit. Dewars and a Diet Coke. Please. Hi. Uh... Yeah, Bernie. Hey, you seen Shelly around? He  promised to position me at the tables  tonight. I've been on skid row all  week. You didn't settle me from last night. No? You sure? Fuck... And I was way  under. It's been, like, an A.A.  convention the whole week. I'll make  up for it tonight. Promise. Thanks. Bitch. That's the third time this  month... Let me get you that cream. Don't get sweet on that, Bernie. Not  unless you're looking to get short- changed. This is you, right? Joe said I should stick around. You  say something to Shelly? Wow. That was fast. Hey, thanks. Nicky, how the hell are you? I didn't  know you were coming in... You shoulda called ahead. I woulda  sent a car... Well, anytime, Nicky. Anytime. What can I get you boys to drink? So... what brings you to town, Nicky? Revitalize? What are you talking  about? We did thirty-five million  last year. You mean, that amusement park mook  fest out there? You know what that  is? That's a fucking violation of  something that used to be beautiful.  That used to have class. Like a  gorgeous high priced hooker with an  exclusive clientele. And then that  Steve Wynn cocksucker knocks her up  and puts her in a family way. Now she's nothing but a cheap, fat  whore hiding behind too much makeup.  I look at her and see all those ugly  stretch marks and I want to cry.  'Cause I remember her as she was. What? You think I'm trying to compete  with that? You think this joint's  about bringing in the stroller crowd?  Fresh off some fucking E-ticket ride,  looking to break the house on red  and black. Fremont's never been about  that bullshit. This is where old  time and real money comes to play. So, how's the action? Bernie. Mr. Cool. Got a moment? It can wait. How's the knee? I was speaking to this orthopedic  surgeon over at Vegas Memorial. He  tells me they can replace a man's  entire kneecap with titanium. It's  the kinda thing that costs a shitload,  but since the man's into us for five  hundred large, I'm sure we could -- Where you gonna go, Bernie? Where  the fuck are you gonna go that's  better'n here? I got you covered in  this town. People, they know you  work for me, that's currency in your  pocket. That's fuckin' respect when  you walk the floor. Where you gonna  get that anyplace else? That's right. I like to know who's  shopping it in my neighborhood. You  wanna keep working the Shangri-la,  you come see me tomorrow morning in  my office. We'll go over the rules  together. And before you come, you  bring me a clean bill of health. OK? All right, get outta here. You want that, Bernie? She's yours.  Anytime. I'll keep a tab running for  you. What's a matter? Not your type? Seven and Seven? Oh shit... Sorry... I'm such a klutz. Sorry, this guy... fuckin' hands,  you know... You were velvet out there, pops.  Silk. They were hanging on the door outside.  Forget your tonsils. When the muff  confetti stops coming, that's when  you got yourself a problem. Excuse me? Are you kidding me? Gimme that. You don't fucking deserve this. All  those ladies going home with a sweet  breeze between their legs because  you still do it for them and you're  fingering me for some kinda Buddy  Stafford ego pimp. Hey, fuck you,  old man. Pride. It's called a pride. Yeah, nature's got a real sick sense  of humor. That's like admitting to yourself  that you're already dead. I prefer  nature's way. I know you from somewhere, right? And I should be interested in this,  why? We? Even if I were interested, Buddy's  got ink with us through 2003. I just  renegotiated his contract last year. Buddy asked me to send you his  regards, Nicky. He's not feeling so  great. I think he's got that stomach  flu that's going around. Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be  able to hook us up with some  showgirls. Something with class. Sure, no problem. You got any  preferences? You got any Asian babes? Buy you a drink? Your Progressed Venus is Gemini,  12.5 Degrees, and is in Direct motion.  Which tells me that you're a slow  starter when it comes to romance. You know what? This is real  unprofessional of me. I shouldn't  discuss your chart with you until  I'm all done. I can tell by that  look, you think this is all a lot of The outcome? There's not, like, one  particular outcome. A lot of things  enter into it. The planets, moon  phases... God, I have never met anyone who was  so down on themselves. I used to be  down on myself, OK? I don't go there  anymore. I've got just three more  correspondence classes with this  stuff, then I'll have my certificate  and everything. And you know how I  got OK? Yes, as a matter of fact that is  perfectly correct. I asked around. You're a "cooler."  You turn winners into losers. I know there's stuff that goes on in  casinos all the time -- That sounds to me like a self  fulfilling prophecy. There's a whole  chapter on that in my course. Anyways,  I can see a big factor in your life  is that you're lacking companionship.  There's nobody to deflect off. If  you've got, as you put it, bad karma,  then you need someone with good karma  to neutralize it. Well, that's my  take on it anyway. I have this recurring dream where  I'm on some beautiful island in the  Bahamas. I'm sitting on the beach,  taking in this amazing sunset with  one of these in my hand ...and then it starts to rain. And I  wake up and it's my roof leaking on  me. Yeah, I'm also real tired, Bernie. Only five more days? Then we shouldn't waste any more  time. Why don't we go back to your place? Ah, just shut up, Bernie. You haven't  gone and cooled anything. Not by a  long shot. You should complain about this. Nah. I've had my fill. Go ahead. You know, once they're dead, they  don't really grow back. In case,  that's what you're waiting for. So... got any music? Sit. Relax. I promise you, at least  one of us has done this before. Sssh. Surprise me. You're doing real good. Don't worry, Bernie. I've had worse.  We'll try again later. Hey, so, you wanna get some breakfast? He did that to you? What, he shot  you? That's getting off easy? But he maimed you... Jesus... I thought stuff like that  didn't happen no more. Like that was  just in the movies or something. Oh shit, I think I'm going into labor! I'm OK now. False alarm. Thanks. When was the last time you saw a  doctor? This clinic in Jersey. Maybe six  months ago. I wasn't about to go  back after they treated me like  cattle. Just because I didn't have  no insurance. And those places,  they're crawling with T.B. from all  'em spies. Take care. What was that? Well, what fucking gives? Is it  McGann? He's been with us twelve  years. The man's as standup as my  dick. Maybe he's got money problems. I'm  gonna pull him. He wasn't counting  'em, was he? The mook with the streak? No, there's no problem. Fella's on a  streak, is all. Why don't you announce it to the  whole fucking joint? He's the best. Take it from me. That right? I suppose you got a whole  fucking prospectus on the subject. Yeah? Wallpaper? Get a hold of his daughter. Assist  her with the arrangements. The Shangri- la will take care of everything. She goes dark tonight. What? What? An easy mark? You notice last night, that tattoo  on my butt? Yeah, two twos. Little Joe. I had a son. His name was Joe. I was  his mother for a year. I want to, Bernie. Better you know  the worst of me up front. Later,  when I'm already invested in you,  it'll be too hard to come clean.  After I tell you this, you'll  probably... I mean, I'll understand. I gave my son up for adoption. I  just wanted my life back. I was  seventeen going on eighteen and I  was selfish. My family, they didn't  want to have nothing to do with me  after that. So I hitched a ride out  here. Figured I could make it as a  showgirl. Ten years later... I like to think that if it happened  when I was older -- with some guy I  cared about -- maybe things would  have been different. I think about  my Little Joe. And, I do know he's  better off. I'm convinced of that. I gotta go pee. I'm always peeing. How did you get in here? Bernie's looking for a parking space. Excuse me? You missed some. Bless you, Bernie. You know, Michael, I  -- think we  should name her Bernadette. After  your father. Wanna feel her? Ooh, I just felt her kick. C'mon,  Bernie, gimme your hand... Feel that? Take care, Pop. What's going on, Nicky? Don't worry, Shelly, you're gonna  love it. In "Lost Horizon," these people,  their plane crashes in the Himalayas --  and they get rescued and taken to  this Utopia in the mountains. Shangri- la. It's beautiful. The place is  completely isolated. Untouched by  the outside world. There's no war,  no greed, no bullshit... Time is  slowed down. People, they don't age.  It's... paradise. That's what Shangri- la is. Paradise. You don't fuck with paradise! All'a  ya! How... how, Nicky, could it be any  better? Right now it's perfect. It's  the last of its kind. It's pure...  and this. ...this is just... it's a mockery.  An insult. Trying to make something  of it that it isn't. Whose talking about a fuckin' movie?  This ain't a fuckin' movie. This is  my life. This is my house of worship.  You people are shittin' on all that's  sacred to me. I got just one question? Where you  gonna be when they decide to change  it back? When the people, they come  looking for the real Vegas, from  before all this Epcott Center  bullshit. Who's gonna it give it to  them? You guys? I don't think so.  You know who? The same fucks who  started this shit in the first place.  It's all gonna come full circle and  bite you in the ass. Mark my words. Where's that? Behind the bar? Behind the bar, that's a good one. Speaking of things to digest, I'm  starving. How's that buffet they got  in the Valley of the Blue Moon? You  recommend their prime rib, Shell? It's food. I thought we were gonna eat? Maybe we wanna play over there. Less  crowded. You're right. He's just a piece of  shit. Forget about him. So where does that leave us? God, Bernie, that's... Bernie... I want to be with you. I  do. But I don't know if I can leave  with you. I was working on a compatibility  chart for the two of us. And it looks  good, really, it does. That's with us here. In Vegas. Maybe I was being presumptuous, 'cause  I knew you were leaving... and I  tried working it in different ways...  It wasn't good, Bernie. I got scared.  But that's just for now, for the  immediate future. Once the planets  realign, maybe a year from now... Why, Bernie? We only got a couple  days left together. Why not make the  most of them? And that's so bad? Take care, Bernie. Come on, Mikey. This is our future.  Don't blow it. Come on all you's. Put a good thought  in for our baby! Oh my god, I just felt him kick! He  knows. He knows you're all pulling  for him. God bless you all. How much? Fucking amateurs... And then we'll give 'em both a  lollipop for the ride home. Come  watch and learn, Harvard. A little  lesson on how to protect your  investment -- the old school way. Hey, that was some run you had back  there. Why don't we go do this in my office?  I don't like to hand out all this  amount of cash on the floor. Oh my God... I can feel the  contractions coming on... Get lost, Bernie, this got nothing  to do with you. What did you say? Who? This little prick? Were you in on this? Jesus, you better  come clean with me. How much you think their lives are  worth, Bernie? Myself, I don't think  they're worth piss. But, hey, it  ain't my kid... Let me see: they were up almost a  hundred and fifty grand. That's 150  G's someone's gonna have to account  for. What do you say, Bernie, seventy- five grand a piece? Hey, I know you don't have that kind  of cash. But, since you're a friend  of the house, I'm willing to front  you. Oh god, oh god... you gotta get me  to the hospital... contractions... Hey, why don't we all break out the  champagne? Lootz is about to become  a granddaddy. How you doin' there, sweetheart?  Must hurt like crap, huh? Hurts so bad... Yeah? Oh God... Here! It's a fuckin' boy. Anyone got  a cigar? You sure you still want to be good  for it? Because if you want to change  your mind, I don't blame you. That's the worst fucking call you  ever made in your life. 150 G's buys their lives. This is  just a little slap on the wrist to  remember me by. Oh god... it wasn't my idea. You know, motherhood is a beautiful  thing. This... you made a mockery  out of it. Maybe you'll get to  experience it for real one day. I want... to be a mother... please  don't hurt me... I'm not going to hurt you. Get 'em outta here. You ever see  them in this joint again, kill 'em. You two, you're still on shift. Bernie, it's a big world out there.  If you just took off -- if we took  off. You awake, Bernie? I -- think I love you. No, I don't think. I'm pretty certain  of it. You blind-sided me, Bernie Lootz. I  never saw this coming. You shouldn't  do that to a girl. There's still things you don't know...  should know... I don't want to ruin  it... Say 'em anyway. To hell with rotten  luck. That's overs. Yeah, it's me. Get Bernie over to  crap table six. You wanna tell me what's going on  out there? What do you mean... What do you mean, you don't know?  We're down almost a mil out there.  Doesn't seem strange to you? You don't have off days, Lootz. You're  shitty luck incarnate. What's wrong?  You coming down with something? You've  got this look about you... What's that supposed to mean? Natalie? She told you, she loves  you? Put that fucking thing out! Sorry. You should be. You've gone and fucked  it up big time. I paid you to be his  cooze companion, not his fucking  true love. But, no, you had to go  and get all profound on the poor  schmuck. "I love you, Bernie." You know what  you've gone and done, sweetheart?  Those four little words of endearment  have already cost this casino a  million and counting today. I don't understand... Lady luck. You never heard'a lady  luck?! That's what's goin' on out  there. Lootz is Kryptonite on a stick.  He should have 'em throwing ice cubes  out there, but instead I got a fuckin'  meltdown on my hands. OK, here's what's gonna happen. You're  outta his life by the time he gets  home. Don't even tell him to his  face, just leave a note. I'll make  some calls, situate you at another  joint. I can't do that. Excuse me? It wasn't an act. I meant it. I love  him. What's there to fuckin' love? He's a  loser. Always has been, always will  be. I thought you were his friend... And I thought you were a smart cookie  when I picked you out. You do not  want to fuck me over, darlin'. I'll  see to it that your next John's a  rattlesnake out in the desert. Now  get the fuck outta here. Jesus, Bernie, is that what you think  of me? That I would fuck with your  happiness? That hurts. Buddy was tired. I gave him an easy  out. It coulda been a lot worse... He woulda never taken the buy-out  offer. Buddy woulda stuck to his  guns, no matter what. And they woulda  ended up hurting him. I couldn't let  that happen. Listen to me, you dumb fuck -- I  loved that sonofabitch. But his time  was up. What I was supposed to do,  leave him to those corporate wolves?  What I did, it was the humanitarian  thing. That I have no doubt about.  Afterwards, I held him in my arms  and I cried like a fucking baby.  What? You got this look -- what's  this fucking look? Bernie? You awake? Let's just take off. I mean it. Let's just pack up and  go. Tonight. Fuck Shelly. He doesn't give a shit  about you. Let's just climb into  your car and get the hell out of  here. Just hold me. Hey! Ouch! What are you...? You got no fucking right...! What did I tell you?! What did I  fuckin' tell you?! I tried... I couldn't... I don't give a fuck! You're gone, sweetheart. History.  Kiss paradise goodbye. I can't leave! I won't! I love him.  Doesn't that mean anything to you,  you heartless fuck? Who the fuck do you think you are?  You ain't nobody! I could make you  disappear like this... And nobody would ever notice you  were gone. Nobody! Bernie would! I got friends! You  don't fuckin' own me. You got no  right -- Fuck you! You fuckin' cunt... You think that's bad? That's just a  taste, bitch. You're still here when  Bernie gets home and I'll finish the  job. I'll cut you into so many fuckin'  pieces, the vultures'll be trading  on you for a month. Here... go get yourself some cosmetic  surgery. No, don't. I've got a headache. Yeah. I already took something. Bernie, no! Shit... I love you, Bernie. I just want you  to know that. I fell in love with  you. That wasn't part of the plan. I  thought... easy money... Shelly. He paid me to get next to  you. To keep you around. Whatever it  took... You got it right the first night. I  was for sale. Bought and paid for.  You were the easy mark, Bernie. At first you were just another John.  But then I started to take a closer  look. For the first time, here was  someone who wasn't trying to hustle  me. Wasn't pretending to be somebody  he wasn't. Just a decent guy trying  to get back on track. And it didn't  hurt any that you put me up on a  pedestal. It sure puts the gutter  into perspective... Shelly wants me gone. He says I bring  you luck. Lady luck. I stayed... to  tell you to your face... and then  you wouldn't want me no more... and  I could just go... Just tell me one thing, Bernie. Tell  me there's gonna be a later. Tell me again, Bernie. Tell me it's  all gonna be okay. You don't have to do this, Bernie. Bernie, your chart... that first  night. I wasn't being straight with  you. It's the worst chart I've ever  seen. There's nothing in the cards  for you. I'm scared... It's three thousand dollars. Take  it. Maybe Shelly'll accept it as a  down payment. We can send him the  rest in installments... after we get  settled. Take it. I know, Bernie. I know. Bernie, what's the matter? You look  a little fucking spooked. Will you excuse me for a moment? Because you never give up a good  thing, Bernie. You are a good thing.  The best fuckin' cooler there ever  was. And I need him back. That's a dead man talking. You try to walk on me, Bernie, and  I'll fuckin' bury you. The both of  you. What the fuck? Me? I'm the loser? What the fuck more do I need? You believe this fuckin' guy? That's a real heartfelt speech, Lootz.  All that Jimmy Stewart in ya face  intensity. You almost sold me. Man, I've got a fucking lump in my  throat. But it still don't change things.  You bail on me without making good  on my 150 G's and I'm gonna be forced  to close the books on you. You and  the broad. You leave me no choice. How much is he up? Why didn't one of you fucking geniuses  call me? Lootz's off the clock. As long as  he's off the clock, he's free to  play. Just like every other schmuck  in this joint. Now you listen real good, you Harvard  turd. Lootz is on the up-and-up. He  leaves here tonight with whatever he  comes out with. You so much as touch  a hair on his head and I'll fucking  wallpaper this joint with your ass.  Muted tones, right? What's that? I don't hear nothing.  Wait a minute -- yeah, now I hear  it. Don't do it! Thank God... I thought for sure... It's okay, right? You guys worked it  out. He took the three grand? Tell  me it's okay, Bernie? Want me to get that, Shelly? What are you stopping for? Oh Jesus, Bernie, I knew it. It was  too good to be true. Who were we  kidding? Don't give it a name, Bernie. It  scares me. All I know is, you're  still running hot and that's a good  thing. But we're only winners if we  keep going. No looking back.
