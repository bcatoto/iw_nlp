Oh God... They won't bite me. Good boy. You don't want to bite me, do you? Get it off! Get if off! I'm burning! Jesus! Help me! I'm burning! I'm burning! HERE! OVER HERE! Who are you? You've come from a hospital. He's not a doctor. He's a patient. It began as rioting. And right from the beginning, you knew something bad was going on because the rioters were killing people. And then it wasn't on the TV anymore. It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows. We all guessed it was a virus. An infection. You didn't need a doctor to tell you that. It was the blood. Yours will be dead too. You'll go and come back. If there's anyone in there who isn't human... Anyone. They died peacefully. You should be grateful. We don't have time to get back to the shop before dark. We should stay here tonight. We'll sleep in the same room. It's safer. Were you bitten? Were you bitten? Did any of the blood get in your mouth? Mark? Get that cleaned off. Do you have any clothes here? Then get them. And get dressed. We have to leave, now. More infected will be coming. They always do. The blood. I didn't know he was infected. Okay? I didn't know. He knew. I could see it in his face. You need to understand, if someone gets infected, you've got somewhere between ten and twenty seconds to kill them. They might be your brother or your sister or your oldest friend. It makes no difference Just so as you know, if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat. Five days. Or six. Does it matter? He was full of plans. Long-distance weapons, so they don't get close. A newsagent's with a metal grill, so you can sleep. Petrol bombs, so the blood doesn't splash. Got a plan yet, Jim? You want us to find a cure and save the world? Or fall in love and fuck? Plans are pointless. Staying alive is as good as it gets. Shhh. Need a break? No. What's up? Bad? Why didn't you say something before? (going through the bag) You've got no fat on you, and all you've had to eat is sugar. So you're crashing. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot we can do about that... ...except pump you full painkillers, and give you more sugar to eat. As for the sugar: Lilt or Tango? Actually, I did have a can of Sprite, but... Quiet. That's an infected. They're in. Come on! Let us in! Where's Dad? Selena. We've got Mum's creme de menthe. Shall we? Middle cupboard. Top cupboard. We're grateful. And you haven't seen any people outside? Didn't come back. It's a good set-up. Very spruce. Uh-huh. They're desperate. Probably need us more than we need them. Good people? Well, that's nice. But you should be more concerned about whether they're going to slow you down. I'd leave them behind. Yeah. Then you're going to wind up getting yourself killed. I'm going to get some sleep. Sure. And I mean sure. Good night, Jim. There haven't been any broadcasts for weeks. Soldiers. We. I wasn't - If it's a recording, for all we know the soldiers who made it are dead. And that stuff about the answer to infection. There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can. Maybe they've got nothing at all. We could die trying. Or die here. And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said. You need us just the same as we need you. We need each other. And we'll never be safe in the cities, and soldiers could keep us safe. So we have to try and get there. It's the most direct route to the other side of the river. They're running from the infected. (straining with the Almost there! Whoa! Stop the cab! Stop the cab! Un. Believable. This place hasn't been looted. It's a gold mine. But we don't know what's in there. Food and drink is what's in there. And we need it. I've been living off Mars Bars and Coke for two weeks. I need some tinned fruit. Let's shop. I'll have you, you, you, you... Don't take anything we need to cook. Ugh. If I never see chocolate again, it'll be too soon. Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange, of course. (taking a handful of Or Yorkies, obviously. We could have a problem here. Yes, Dad. Stay close, Jim. You heard. Where are you going? We've got enough food. Find anything. Find anything, Jim? (leaning out of the Oh my God, yes. I can taste the vitamin C. I can feel it in my blood. It's true. They are like biscuits. What did you say? Do you think they're infected? You were thinking that you'll never hear another piece of original music ever again. You'll never read a book that isn't already written. Or see a film that isn't already shot. No... I was thinking I was wrong. All the death, all the shit - it doesn't really mean anything for Frank and Hannah. Because she's got her dad, and he's got his daughter, so... it's okay. (looking back at Jim) I was wrong when I told you that staying alive is as good as it gets. ...Was it? (smiling back at Jim) Sorry. Can't sleep. ...Selena didn't seem to have any trouble. Selena...Selena! What... what is it... I didn't need a prescription. I'm a qualified chemist. Can I, Dad? Da-ad, plee-ease. I can't sleep. No fire crews to put it out. Is it snow? Don't. We might attract the wrong kind of attention. Or overrun. I don't understand. Did they leave? I don't like this. I think we should go. Frank. Yes. Dad... are you okay? ...What? ...Dad? (moving to Frank) Why? What's... Jim... (breaking into a run) Jim, he's infected! No! No! (holding Hannah back) Jim! Dad! Jim! KILL HIM! ...Dad? Jesus. She's lost her dad. That's how she is. It's all fucked, Jim. Shut up, Jim. Just shut up. I don't want her to fucking cope. I want her to be okay. And when Hannah had her dad, it was all okay. Remember? And when it was okay for them, it was okay for us. And now it's all fucked. We'll have eggs again. Once everything's back to normal. Uh...yeah. You're not eating. I don't want to eat. I don't want to eat. I want to bury my dad. He's one of the people you're talking about. Fuck you! Wha... But we... You can't do this to her! She's only fourteen! You need to give me a moment with Hannah. Alone. He wants us to dress up nice. But if you want us to change, you'll have to get out of the room. (calm, powerful) It's just fucking polite. Eat them. Eat them, Hannah! Are you killing me? No. I'm making you not care. Jim. Those pills. I think they're having an effect. I can feel them, and... I don't feel sleepy, but... They've been a long time. What are you going to do if they don't come back? Will you be the boss if Henry is dead? Is that the way if works? I don't think they are coming back. I think they've been killed. Hannah... They're dead. You're going to be next. Hannah! Hannah! We have to get out of here! Oh Jesus, Jesus, Hannah, stay with it, stay with it. (relaxed, as she's yanked Mitchell? What's going on? Hannah! I don't have any bullets! I don't have any fucking bullets! Don't leave me! Hannah! ...Jim? I thought...I thought you were... Hannah! Stop! It's okay! He's not infected! I thought he was biting you. It's a long story. We have to get out of here. Jim! We're going to crash! We're going to crash! There! THERE!
