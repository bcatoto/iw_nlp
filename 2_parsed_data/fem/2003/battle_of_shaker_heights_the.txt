Where the hell are those Krauts?  Shit.  Bingo.  "And so they buried Hector, breaker  of horses."  Kill me Adolf.  Hey, Siegfreid and Roy. What are you  waiting for? Kill me.  Come on you pussies. Let's get this  over with.  Genuine Third Reich issue, no less.  Nice work.  My mother and I don't have that kind  of relationship.  What don't you understand?  You got to be kidding me.  Now that's against the rules.  You've never killed anyone before,  have you?  No wonder you smell so bad.  Will you look at the manners on this  guy? Remember to thank me when I kill  you.  You all right?  Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't  going anywhere anyway.  You want me to give you a minute?  That's okay. They'll get me  eventually. If you can't get killed  in a war, when can you?  That's right. Look on the bright  side.  Bart. Bart Bowland.  Kelly. Kelly Ernswiler.  Bart?  Listen you wienerschnitzel. You should  talk. You slapped me. I'm not your  bitch.  Well it didn't work, now did it?  And what was that ridiculous shit  about making me write to my mother?  Right.  Yup. Just got her. Three summers  packing out at Shop Rite.  My bad. Thanks though.  See you.  Well, come on.  I couldn't resist.  That's what you get for invading  Wisconsin.  That's crazy.  Shaker Heights.  Penn Place.  It's not technically in Shaker Heights  - but I go to Shaker Heights High.  Sorry to hear that.  Of course. I would have gone to  Langely myself only my polo pony had  the fits.  I would, but then I might soil my  croquet whites. You understand.  Sleep tight Hot Lips.  Let me guess. Happy Meals for the  wavy gravy wellness center?  As usual, your cheerful optimism  makes me ill.   A rough charge. You know.  Don't touch anything. We have to get  ready for the Starving Artist show. Now Nana, the gold has to be feathery,  not gloppy - see?  Now you try.  She loves the gold. Always overuses  it. And usually her touch is so light.  You know why we never have anything  to eat in this house?  Mao, what did we say about the eyes?  That's right. And didn't I tell you  to put in more cacti?  Oh boy. I'm not having this battle  with you again.  Because your husband takes food from  his own family to feed every loser  druggie in Cleveland.  Well, you can always chip in here.  We're ordering pizza later.  No. Some people have to work later. Will you drop something off at the  dry cleaners for me tomorrow?  Sweetie, you know what we said about  paying for the war things. Nothing's  changed.  It's the only thing I ever ask you  for --  Don't be dramatic.  But it's important to me.  You're just going to have to find a  way to pay for it yourself then, I  guess. No - not that way - the sky should  be stormier. Angry clouds.  Why do I bother?  More brown, less blue.  How about the son of a heroin addict  trying to get ready for work?  So how'd your battle go today? I  still don't understand how you could  reenact the Battle of the Bulge in  seventy-two degree weather. Didn't all those guys freeze to death?  Well, a Port-a-John fell over on a  couple of guys.  That's gross.  War is hell.  Then why do you do it?  You're never more alive then when  facing simulated death.  Really? Maybe I should try it.  You are William J. Stone of the 1st  Airborne, pinned down in Noville.  The Germans have the high ground and  they're shelling your position  heavily. You're holed up in a stone barn.  Sustaining heavy casualties. Running  low on ammo. The cries of wounded  men fill the air like the cries of  hungry babies.  Your commanding officer gets hit in  the face, dies. At 1 p.m. you lose  radio contact with headquarters. If  you withdraw, the Germans will flank  the entire Allied forces arrayed  along Bastogne and break the front.  What do you do? What do you do?  Stop it!  Battle of Bulge, the Southern  Shoulder, December '44.  Sorry I asked.  Hey. Want a snack? We got a whole  shipment in of busted Oreo's.  I'll accidentally drop a couple pints  of milk and meet you over there.  The frozen food woman came in with  her kids. They must eat out of those  little cardboard trays every night.  One of the kids looked like cardboard.  Do you know we stock more flavors of  cat food than we do baby food?  No.  Sixteen flavors of baby food including  the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty- one flavors of cat food.  Next time you should tell that woman  to buy her kid some cat food.  Is this store open? I've been waiting  up front. If the store's closed, it  shouldn't have a sign that says twenty- four hours.  Sorry about that.  I have a lot of coupons and I don't  want to be here when they expire.  Charge her double for everything.  I honestly didn't know it was you. I  thought it was a free preview of the  Spice Channel.  Stop it.  No.  Come on. Isn't this analysis a tad  simplistic? I mean, maybe for a second  grade history class, sure - but to  insist on still characterizing the  Civil War as some moral struggle?  The soldiers were drafted - the only  ones who had to fight were the ones  who couldn't afford to pay their way  out. Why don't you talk about the Draft  Riots? Where are your slides for  that?  I know. I mean, who ever heard of a  classroom dialog? Not Socrates.  I don't need to. Everyone else makes  them for me.  I was wondering what the tissues  were for.  Advertisers use status and sex to  appeal to my demographic.  Give me a break.  What are you going to do, make out  with me?  You just used fuck as a verb, noun,  and adjective. Impressive.  Rim job.  You work here?  Looking for a backpack.  Sure, I guess.  Very impressive.  What's this?  Wow. Your dad should meet my history  teacher. He sent me to the principal's  office today for questioning his G- rated interpretation of the Civil  War.  I would, but now the principal's  making me give a speech on the Civil  War at an assembly.  She thinks she's doing me a favor.  Depends on who you ask. Everyone's  got an opinion.  Yeah right.  I'd feel weird taking one out of the  tomb of Tutenkamen anyway.  I lost it.  Someone took it.  I didn't let him. I told off some  idiot --  I'm telling you, it's not me, it's  the world.  Don't give him any money, whatever  you do.  All these little old ladies are  looking for him in Arizona. He took  their retirement money and bought  defective bazookas with it.  Finally, my life is complete. Fait  accompli.  Sloppy joe? Sloppy no.  I have to go take a shower. Will you  call me when Miner gets here?  Who's Miner?  Oh yeah? Flea market, land of  bargains.  If you stay in it long enough, maybe  you'll get your fudgepacker badge.  Lance!  Too bad my mom won't let me date  yet.  Why do you mess with him?  You're right. I should give him a  break.  Oh, Kelly, you're home. Good. I need  you to go to the art supply store  for me.  Get Abe to do it.  He was going to but he had to go  lead a meeting at Care House.  What a surprise.  I'll make it up to you.  Where have I heard that before?  When are you going to give me a break?  Let me think - maybe when I finally  forget every single word of The Little  Mermaid soundtrack I'd listen to in  the car waiting for him to score.  No, probably when I don't prepare  myself before I go into the bathroom,  expecting to find him passed out on  the floor.  Actually, you know what? I know I'll  be able to put it all behind me when  I go away to college. Only, I can't go because someone  spent my college fund on Mexican  Black Tar. So looks like I'll have  to try to forget at Shop Rite, where  I'll be working for the rest of my  life.  You're right. You have every reason  to crawl into the corner and give  up. But please just get me some paints  first.  What do you need?  We need burnt sienna, cadmium red,  and midnight blue. Two tubes of blue. What happened to your face?  Forget it.  They're having a sale on glitter.  Oh, hello. What happened to you?  Tennis injury.  You paint?  Well, you see... That's a difficult  question.  How so?  I don't really feel comfortable  calling anything done since the  Renaissance "painting." We might  have a more experimental interaction  with the picture plane, but our skills  have suffered from it.  You're working with acrylic. Why?  Oil's much - richer.  Oh you're not one of those oil snobs  are you?  Of course not.  It's just - isn't acrylic a bit -  jejune?  Jejune? You're jejune. How old are  you anyway?  Older than my years.  And you paint?  Well, you know, my mother's kind of  an artist, so -  That explains it.  That explains nothing. Doesn't anyone  believe in innate knowledge anymore?  Michelangelo was fifteen when he  painted the Infanta.  Infantas are Spanish. Michelangelo  was Italian.  Exactly. One world, one people. Just  like Jesse Jackson envisioned.  Well - Kelly. Nice talking to you.  What the hell did you just say?  Buying and selling US service medals  is illegal.  Is that what they teach you at  Langely?  And I'm not even going to ask about  the flask.  You boys look like Goldwater fans.  I've never been accused of that  before.  Well jeez, you don't have to be  insulted.  Fish around in that cigar box.  Twenty dollars.  Don't be so hasty. I got a few Geraldine Ferraro pins  I'm looking to unload.  Goldwater fan. I think that's some  kind of insult.  I'm not.  You don't?  Easy for you to say. You got a royal  flush.  What about Tabby?  I didn't think people actually went  to Yale.  What do you mean?  Oh. Is that what one of those sounds  like? Somehow, I always imagined  they would be funnier.  Sarah Lawrence? Isn't that for  lesbians?  Remember the backpack incident?  The one with mad cow-diseased  hamburger meat for brains? That would  be the one.  I'm not going to lower myself to his  level.  Alternatives?  Yes.  We don't plan first?  Humiliation. Rage. Despair.  Hey. I have some stretcher bars out  in the car. Can somebody help me  bring them in?  Sure. I mean, I'll help.  Gold. The color of the sun.  That's the Cleveland waterfront.  As the viewer, I get to decide what  it is, I'm afraid. And it doesn't  look a thing like it.  It's the light. I was playing with  diffusion.  Well make sure you put it away when  you're done with it.  Very funny, wiseass.  It must be nice to have a place like  this to get away to.  It is.  What about Farmer?  Farmer?  The boyfriend.  Miner? What about him?  Is he an artist, too?  No. Definitely not. Thank god.  You said your mom was a painter?  She was, well - is I guess.  What do you mean?  She used to be. But then my dad -  wasn't working anymore so she turned  it into a business. She has a family  of Chinese immigrants in the garage  making them for her.  Like Andy Warhol's Factory.  More like Andy Warhol's tool shed.  It was nice before, though. My playpen  used to be in her studio.  Wow. So you really grew up with it.  What does, did, your dad do?  He's a VH-1 documentary without the  music.  "Tragedy struck?"  "And then, things took a turn for  the worse."  Well, just wait. Those burnout types  always have a triumphant comeback  tour.  I already changed the channel.  Have fun, boys.  If only it were fun. War's deadly  serious, ma'am.  And I used to think you were the  only crazy one.  I'm worried about you playing with  diffusion unsupervised.  Are you?  Yes. I might have to come by and  show you the proper safety procedures.  Some time in the presence of an art  prodigy would do you good.  I don't think I have room for a  playpen in here.  Ouch.  What? No, no.  We just have a few things in common.  I can't tell you. It's my feminine  side.  Dad.  Dad?  Sorry.  A funny thing just happened. A little  trip down memory lane. I thought you  were on our couch, dead.  Well that's one of your more brilliant  ideas. Have you thought about the fact that  it might be dangerous? That he might  steal something, or go into cardiac  arrest? Drink all our cooking wine?  Which he seems to have done.  You're right. Besides, having him  here makes it feel like home.  Big whoop. I've been straight the  whole time.  No. That's the one thing I get to  decide.  I have the target in sight.  I think he's leaving.  Is this going to work?  Save it for the press conference.  We're the good guys. If you scream,  the bad guys are going to come and  burn down your house. Okay? So stay  here and be quiet.  My dad has a gun.  I was just inspecting your lawn.  Have you thought about Astroturf? It  takes a lot less water to keep green.  I mean, no water, technically.  Oh. I see. Okay then.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Did you get it done?    You're right. But I was thinking it.  Instead I just told her to add more  vinegar next time, and -  I don't think we can use any of this.  All right, then.  -- And if we don't sell them there,  we'll set up on the corner of Stevens  and Lane, by the gas station. That's  a good location.  Are you listening to me?  The same as always.  Kelly. Want dinner?   One day, we're all going to be happy.  What? What?  I told you, that makes me nervous.  Me no likey.  Still. That's not a good enough  reason.  But people might see us.  Dangerous.  Let's draw up the plans.  Oh Jesus, I'm so sorry -  Oh, it's okay -  I'm working on it.  I feel kind of bad for her. She's a  nice girl.  Stop it.  How does that look?  You don't need to tell me. It's my  ass on the line.  You'll get the de-brief.  You couldn't do any better than that?  What's gotten into you?  Did you drink a bottle of Robitussin  before school again?  Eine maus findet den kase.  But I just got this note last period.  Well I don't have anything here for  you - let me look again. Oh yes, the  MENSA called.  Cool. They want me to be an honorary  member. Is that like a sorority or something?  Yup. There it was. The whole school  saw it. Wasn't too impressive either.  To the 193rd.  Good. Real good.  Don't mind if I do.  You know what this is?  Eighteen volts of pure freedom.  Sounds dangerous.  Oh, it is. Unless you know how to  handle it.  You ever seen the freshly waxed floor  in the produce section glistening  under full florescence? It's  breathtaking.  Hold on tight.  Close call.  Have you been drinking?  Kelly? Bart's not here, he -  Oh, that's all right. Actually, I'm  here to see Tabby. Just to do a little  painting with her.  She's out back in her studio.  Thanks.  Kelly?  Hey. I warned you I'd come.  You did.  Maybe I should go --  Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set  your canvas up. Use one of the ones  in the corner.  Brushes are in the jar. Paint's in  the drawer.  I brought my own.  Well then.  Does it mess up your concentration?  Me being here?  No.  Oh. That's good.  Just don't talk.  Why would I?  I'm kidding.  Right. Irony. I like that.   Miner Webber.  Webber Miner.  Kelly. This is Kelly -  Kelly Ernswiler. Sorry. I -  Quite all right. So, what do we have here, a little  painting class?  Kelly's a friend of Bart's. He paints.  Oh? What's your real job?  That would be stock boy at the Shop  Rite. But, as President Don Kaminsky  says, every employee is part owner.  So you could say I'm a captain-of- industry in training. Kind of  capitalist larva.  That's quite an image.  Only if you see the most magical  part. Do you see?  What?  One day I'll be a beautiful butterfly.  First I'll have to be a pupa though.  I figure I won't be going out much  then. Pupa: the awkward adolescence  of the insect world.  Whatever it takes to get you through  the day.  I have the afternoon off. Come away  with me.  I'm not at a good stopping point.  Oh, come on. They'll still be here. I know you'll still be here.  I really shouldn't.  But everyone will be coming soon.  And it will get all crazy, and we  won't have any time to ourselves.  We will. I promise.  Like tonight? We can practice  honeymoon suite.  Maybe. Probably.  Is he always like that?  Like what?  Overbearing.  Just because he didn't want to picture  you as a pupa?  Oh, he will - later. When he's alone.  Whether he wants to or not.  Not that though. How he wanted you  to stop.  He wants to be with me. What's so  bad about that?  Just because some one wants to be  with you doesn't mean they're good  for you.  No one should ever ask you to stop.  If you stop, you might not be able  to start again. Or you might start  again, only things will be different.  Well, that's sweet -  It's not sweet, actually. It's just  the truth.  Hey, I can take care of myself.  When's the wedding?  At the end of the month. But don't  ask me about it. It makes me nervous.  Why? Is something wrong?  No.  What are you painting?  Really, there are so many layers of  - imagistic symbolism - that I really  don't feel comfortable summing it  up, but, well - it's a recurring  dream image. A mermaid riding a rocket  ship.  How?  What do you mean, "how?" Sidesaddle.  She's riding it sidesaddle. She's  got a fish tail, for chrissake. I  haven't decided yet if she's got  scuba gear on or not.  Do you have any idea what you're  talking about?  Does that matter?  Well, some people actually say what  they really think.  What if they don't know what they  really think?  It doesn't matter. It's called being  yourself.  Sounds boring.  Not boring. Scary and wonderful and  exciting.  Hey. I'm trying to create here. Stop  distracting me.  Mom's got you working late?  Wow. You're really good. Why do you  make those stupid animals for mom?  I'm making a lot of art these days.  I guess that means a lot of lessons.  Oh, that's all?  Hey you two. I'll try not to act  surprised. It might spoil the moment.  I can't do this. I have to go.  Keller, I think I'm missing some art  supplies. Have you seen them around  the house?  No, I haven't.  I don't know what to do with him.  When are you going to let me give  you your own show? We could do it  for real.  So darling, when are you going to  bite the bullet and do the seating  arrangement?  I can't deal with that stuff, ma. I  don't care who sits next to whom. I  should have eloped.  After all, Mrs. Bowland, sometimes  when you bite the bullet, it explodes  in your mouth.  Why, I've never thought about it  before but that is a rather strange  expression, isn't it? You wouldn't  say, "Sooner or later you've got to  put the grenade in your pants," would  you?  Yeah, but they never take a bite out  of their pants.  What an unusual conversation! Do you  have similar discussions at the dinner  table with your family, Kelly?  Basically. I ask why all the furniture  is missing and my Dad reminisces  about dropping acid and watching  Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.  He talks about art.  My mother's kind of an artist, so -  I wish my boys would talk to me about  my passions. I can't get them anywhere  near the subject of my garden.  I noticed your magnolias. Very fine  specimens.  They are fine, aren't they?  Cool.  We're going to be on the History  Channel?  Oh, come on.  What do you mean? Of course I will.  I'm not "fast and loose." I play the  emotional truth. I make it real.  What does that have to do with it?  What is this about?  My own agenda? What other reason is  there to do anything?  Are you saying I don't?  Why do you steal from yours?  What presentation?  I don't want to talk about it. As a  matter of fact, do me a favor and  pretend you never heard anything  about it.  Okay. Um.  What, Sarah?  It's nothing. I -  I have an extra ticket to Aerosmith  this weekend.  Aw Sarah, that's really great, I  mean. It's just that - I'm busy.  Oh. Yeah, I figured. Okay. I'll see  you in the dairy section, though.  Right.  What are you doing here?  Yup.  Living, dying, camaraderie, bravery  - the big stuff. Things we don't  have anymore.  Well, no -  No, sir.  You don't really believe that stuff  about Berlin? And Hitler's compound?  Of course it matters. Doesn't the  truth matter?  I want a drink. Let me borrow a couple  bucks.  I was trying to be nice. He's your  friend.  Mountain Dew -  -- Oh shit.  Kelly!  Bart. Meet my mom.  What a nice surprise. It's so nice  to finally meet you.  A little is right. But I work it as  much as I can.  So, what have you boys been up to?  Bart took me to meet his friend  Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home.  Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home?  You don't know him.  You boys should swing by Care House.  There are some Vets there.  We can't.  Oh. Well - okay.  I should go. But you boys should  come over to our house some time. I know your family must get tired of  him.  There you go. Now you know everything.  Forget it.  Are you kidding?  Remember that stupid speech?  I'm supposed to give it next week.  You think he'd go for that?  Are you serious?  I don't think that would work for  me. Considering -- my background.  I'm not properly socialized. I  wouldn't fit in.  No, it's not.  So much she ratted me out to you.  Oh.  I don't know what you're talking  about. Weddings? I love weddings. I  always get drunk and make out with  someone's cousin.  Fletcher, eh?  Why did you tell --  What? Oh, I'm sorry.  Miner and I broke up.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Honestly? I didn't think you two  were right for each other.  You did, huh?  Like this painting. Stare at it too  long and you can't see it anymore.  But if someone else sees it for the  first time, they can tell exactly  what it is.  I don't need any more bullshit right  now.  He could never understand you.  I'm not as complicated as you think.  I never said you were complicated.  Oh.  He just wasn't the right one.  There's more to it than that.  I'm really sorry. I really am.  Thanks.  Don't cry.  You like me, don't you?  Of course.  No, I mean -- you like me.  Yeah. I think you're amazing.  Well, do something.  Damn it. Damn it.  What?  Minnie's starting dinner. Is Kelly  coming over?  Okay, then.  Well, 82nd today. It's not my usual  division. Technically, my patches  indicate -  Oh?  Right. Is Bart Bowland here yet?  Ok. Thanks.  And you are?  Kelly Ernswiler, private first class.  All right, Kelly. Let's take a look  at you.  That's it, handsome.  That MG? She's mine.  Sure. I don't think that would be a  problem.  Have you seen Bart Bowland? Has he  checked in?  Hot Lips, old girl, you're going to  be famous.  Password.  Hey! Where the hell have you been?  They put you over here with me? That's  great. I think we'll get some close- ups. They want me to drive old Lippy.  Isn't that awesome?  What the hell's your problem?  What?  What are you talking about?  Are you out of your mind?  No. You'd rather have me be miserable  like you are.  Stop talking out your dad's mouth  and use your own for once.  I don't want to talk about it.  Well, you're going to have to. Your  father's at the hospital.  Which one of his loser friends ended  up there?  They think he has stomach cancer.  Oh this is just perfect.  Why would you say something like  that?  Because it seems to fit.  "Seems to fit." Do you understand  what I just said?  Why, do you want to say it again?  Kelly -  I have to go to work.  I forgot to tell you this box was  booby-trapped.  The concert was lame. The opening  act singer ripped his leather pants  during a stupid dance routine and  stormed off stage. Are you okay?  No.  Lance?  No.  Listen, I'm busy.  Sure. I understand.  I doubt it.  Um, I don't have a perfect life, if  that's what you're asking.  No, Sarah, actually, I'm not asking.  I never ask you anything but you  just talk anyway. Have you ever  noticed that?  Fuck you.  Hey, I hoped you were up -  Kelly?  I just came to get this.  Hey.  I guess the wedding's back on.  We talked.  I'm really sorry.  Don't be.  My dad's got cancer.  Oh, Kelly.  I guess we all get what we deserve.  Stupid bitch.  I'm sorry.  I'm busy.  I don't know what you're talking  about.  Oh that. I heard about it.  I haven't been following the story.  It is over.  Just let me go home.  This isn't a good time for me. Let's  re-schedule.  First you should probably get me to  write home to my mother.  Bart's not here. Sorry.  Oh Kelly. What happened?  Nothing.  Jesus. Let me see that.  Ow.  I'm going over to see dad.  Oh.  And you need to come.  I don't want to.  At this point that's not an option.  Now's not a good time, ma.  It's never a good time.  You can't make me.  It's not about you anymore --  Don't you get it? It was never about  me.  What is wrong with you? When are you  going to stop blaming us, blaming  him? I'm sick of you being angry. I  want to be angry! They just took out  half of your father's stomach -  Enough.  You will not tell me what's enough.  You don't know about anything. All  you do is fight fake battles, in the  woods, on the playground. But this,  right here, us - this is the real  one, the only one worth anything.  The man I love is dying.  That's between you and him.  If I made a mistake, if you felt  left out, I'm sorry. But I can only  deal with one thing at a time.  I was invited.  It's not your wedding.  Why?  She looks beautiful. Tell her - give  her my congratulations.  Grandma Ling. Can you fix this?  Did you come here to work on your  own stuff? Don't waste your time on  this.  You're trying to tell me something,  aren't you?  Hey dad. How you feeling?  They gave me some stitches downstairs. Three.  A couple times, actually.  A few.  It'd be pretty depressing, wouldn't  it?  Plus that, you'd have to have  protesters and stuff.  I could make it work.  Kelly, is that you?  You were expecting some one else?  He looks good.  He looks just like you.  Hey. You going away already?  Is that good?  He's probably right.  Well, go Big Green.  Have fun. And get laid, will ya?  Hey.  Hey.  How come you don't work here anymore?  The Electro-shopper's getting rusty.  I've got a summer internship at an  ad agency.  Fancy.  It's all right, I guess.  No, it's great.  Hey -  When are you going to get a real  job?  I don't know. Probably when I figure  out something better to do.  You can't be a stock boy your whole  life.  Yeah I can. I mean, I probably won't,  but I could.  Well, it was good seeing you.  Um.  What?  Remember that presentation I told  you never to ask me about again?  Lee arrayed his defenses over here.  Only this time, Grant was ready for  him.  That's amazing. Art playing a part  in war.  If you think it would be more fun.  I have.  I still don't understand how you did  that.  I spent my summers with my grandma  in the Catskills. She didn't give me  any spending money. So I played the bones for ice cream.  Hot damn.
