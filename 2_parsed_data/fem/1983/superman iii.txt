Anyday... I guess he misses a lot of dinners. Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful. Me too. That's why I put this one up. Well, aren't you excited? He really was! The dog's always doing that. And the car's always doing that. Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you. No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it. What would I do when I got there? That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there -- on a Wheat King thresher. Do you think I could do it? Do you? No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that. Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. I can never get a way from it. So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville -- Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since -- I really can't remember when. Pate? What pate? I didn't make any -- Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food. No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff. Peanut butter and jelly. No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it. And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often. I'm talking about salt. Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for. Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise. Some people don't think it's healthy. I mean him. It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father? Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon. I just can't stand this. I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there. That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad? You...um...you never got married? Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up. I even had to pawn my diamond ring then. That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky? No, the problem is -- Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot. Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.? You know what's the problem? There must be a gallon of potato salad left over. And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated. Isn't that terrible? You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this. It really isn't easy. I can't Clark already asked me. Didn't you? He used to love this song. Didn't you? So he just said -- "Would you dance with me?" For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me? And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you. You look wonderful. Clark. Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge? But the bridge... He was asleep before his head hit the pillow. Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you. Well...I guess they did get a little carried away. And this is... ...Clark. My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for... Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky. Thank ...you. Ricky? Where...what...But the other night... It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and... Never. I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that. I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first. Lots of things... Well, don't let me keep you from anything. Don't worry. I'm long past saving. I thought you'd never get here. But how? Where's it getting the power from ???! He can have mine. Anytime. Oh, Superman! In other words, push this red button. Gus? Where's the light switch? I can't see anything. And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks? Hey, I know a lot of things! Diet soda? Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement. Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...There is no handle! You just push a button. It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art. People, I am in love with this machine. Go ahead, Mr. White. Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets. By hand. Like the pioneers did. Mr. White, the next number, please? You've got to pick three more numbers. 53! Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question. Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number. The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.Will you stop interrupting ?! You will command the pumps to stop pumping. You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities. Sister! I'm his sister! I can't! It's out of control! Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin! You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems: Superman. The boy you left behind. Come on, will you? We've got to get ready before he gets here. Where do you usually find a light switch? Turn on the light. "At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace. So I understand from the graffiti I've seen. How would you know? Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped. Why stop at coffee! A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working? If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here! Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...! Yes! This time we got it right! Don't bet on it! Like fish he is. I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame. Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig! Who needs Gus? Come on, let's give it a dry run. Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner? We can get to work on that oil! A normal person. So? Where did it come from? What's wrong? How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs... Don't cry, Bubba. Chicken feed. If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons --- Small potatoes. Today coffee---- Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us. She's not his mama either. Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan. Blizzards! Heat waves! It could make weather! Vulcan is the weather satellite our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather. I don't kiss. That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
