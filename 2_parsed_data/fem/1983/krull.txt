That's a better one. That way. I can feel the cold. Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast. I knew you would come. Yes. All directions are the same here. I don't know how. All the passages are guarded. Colwyn ... Colwyn. Colwyn. I love you, Colwyn. I know it. I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out. Colwyn ... In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening. No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me. Colwyn. About what? I can't. I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now. There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry. I don't trust you to wash behind your ears. Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you. We're almost married. Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down. I have no intention of getting used to it. You might be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses. You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome. Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public. Me too. You don't understand. I'm just so relieved . I was sure you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. He will come for me. He will not! It's a lie! I do not want your worlds or your slaves. I do not want your power. It is hideous.They will have the life that you and I might have had. A match for your son, I think. You knew! You are a rude bumpkin! I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise. Yes. For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise. Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood. It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power. It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen. Freylag's stronghold? What news from our friends?You will not, then? One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me. Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price. Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight. Let me comfort you. You too are lonely. Even by you? Am I not beautiful enough to be loved? Am I not worth returning to? Perhaps you think no man would return to me.There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other. You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out. It will not help. Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here. No. You lie! Why must you know? Of what? Power you have given me. What can my power give you? Yes. Those are reflections. This is my face! Do not try your trickery on me! I killed him when he was born. This place is my punishment. You had left me! I kept silent out of rage. You had a son. She bore you many children? She was not as beautiful. But you would not stay with me. I was beautiful then. It is fifty years since I heard that name. Who speaks that name!
