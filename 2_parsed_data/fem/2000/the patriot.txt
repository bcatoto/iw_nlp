Thank you. Late summer. Good. Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy? Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl? I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning. Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow. Next time we'll bring more blankets. You call that a compliment? It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month. I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.Lovely. Goodbye. Very well, then. Do you? I said, I'm not my sister. If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own. Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed. You couldn't have known. And send us to war alongside Massachusetts. As do you. Thank you.But what about Thomas? We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm. She's to the west. How far away?Yes, I do. I hate him and I hope he never comes back. I don't care. I hate him. He left us.
