They've never been like anyone else.  From the moment they were born, of  the same womb, on the same day, they  just had their own way, my boys did.  And I always knew that one day they  would do something of true greatness.  I just never expected they would  bring about such a... such a  reckoning. Rozengurtle Baumgartner. I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by  men. Rule of thumb? Do you know where that term comes  from? In the early 1900's it was  legal for men to beat their wives as  long as they used a stick no wider  than their thumb. I knew you two pricks would give me  problems. Give me shit cause I'm a  woman. I'm not gonna take your male  dominance bullshit! Fuck you... ...and fuck you! Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck  face? You fuckin' slaves. Kowtowing to the  needs of men! Get up! Get the fuck  up! Leave him there. Connor, is that you? Is that worthless brother of your  there? I want you both ta hear this. It's all your fault. Both you little  bastards. I was a fool to believe  you would bring me any peace. The  day your Da left us when you were  almost too young to remember, he  said the two of you would do me right  and make me proud, but he was wrong  and I got nothin' ta live for. I finally found your Da's army  revolver, Connor. I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now. I want ta tell ya one last thing  before I pull the trigger. I... BLAME... YOU...! Oh, Jesus! No ma! Christ ma! No! Okay, seriously, both you listen ta  me now. It's only 11:00 here boys so I got  lot's more drinkin' ta do with your  worthless relatives down at the Anvil. Well, you know how it is with him.  Always complainin' he's never turnin'  a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn  family goes down there with no money,  cause we know he can't bear ta charge  us. But he's been havin' himself a nip  or two as well... Been up the  waitress' skirt all night, poor girl. Lord's name. What did you do, Connor? What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya  trounced her a good one! Well listen, I know how my boys take  ta scrappin' when they take ta  drinkin'. I mean it now. I carried the two of  you little bastards around in my  belly at the same time you ungrateful  pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure  in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked  me dry. My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles.  I trip over em for Christ sakes, now  ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN! Promise me boys. Well, there's my boys. Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused  a ruckus with that shot. Half the  damn neighborhood is comin'. Still bickerin' over that, huh? All right, I suppose you have the  right ta know. Are ya ready? The one with the biggest cock! How did you know that? What's the symbology there? Holy shit. You're the first one that's  ever got that. Uh... two shooters! So, what do we do now? Here kitty, kitty...... kitty. She was in here when it went down. They were wearing masks. Three. Only two did the shooting. So what are you thinking, Russian  retaliation? Maybe the three of them had something  in common. That's just fucking weird. I have no  idea. How do you figure? Rocco? Rocco! ROCCO! Where's my cat? You... oh god, why? You killed my... my... My, my... Pee...Per...Man. It was... It was... Don't you yell at her! No. No. It's not fat. Fuck. Vincenzo told Sal first. That  fat fuck knew before we did. At least we got our funny man back. I can't get a good sample. There is  variable here I'm not seeing. Boston Police Department. Joey Bevo sent me over. As  entertainment. Yes. I was there. I guess we all know what is right  and wrong. We all know. Nobody needs  to be convinced of what he was...  I'm going home now to have my first  real full night's sleep.
