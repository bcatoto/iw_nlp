I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in. All these good people have totally been led astray. I'll call her later. Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him. Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now. You're already there... It would be so okay. I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do. Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have. Yeah, you do... She's so nice. We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look. Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back... Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye. That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi." It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer. Angels don't get any older, son. Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair. Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel. Try an angel. A mountain goat? That's really sweet. Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom? Maybe try the opposite of that.She goes to Parson's, right? Show him Central Park. You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life. I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris. So excited.Yes, great movie... You keep a bat under your seat? You followed him? Oh, that's terrible, Reege...I love you. Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that? Nicky! Don't do it. "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..." We're going to Jersey? Can we go fly over Central Park? Okay, I do. Get back up here. ..."The Devil?"... Yes... What do you mean, "possessed?" Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger. Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am. Why would you be floating? What are you doing? Are you dead? What were you thinking coming here? Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there. What was that? What? You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool. Basically, yeah. Sometimes, sure. My perfume? Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty. I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog. You have a dog? What kind? This town is really going to hell lately. So what part of the city do you live in? It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it. "Octopus people?" If you want to. That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati. Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out. I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older. My dad's an optometrist. Why are you laughing? Really? I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from? That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
