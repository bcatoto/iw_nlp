You do? He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating. Why? Yeah?I get the imports. Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben. Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard. I get all your CDs. Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two. ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN? I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS. I think it's funny. If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop? I never fucked Rod. I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?No! Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye. No I wasn't. Who is she Daddy? You know her? She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa. It was a she. I thought you'd be pleased. You are upset. Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?! Not much further. Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS! A little. Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses. What do you mean? What's wrong? I will. Is that all? No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now. I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything. I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird. Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler. Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends! It won't happen again. What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME. Daddy you scared me! Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you? You're the killed. Yes. _ Your father raped someone? What do you know about my father? Me? Why me? Really? You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston? Of course I'm scared. You know about that too? Sure. Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car? I am. I can't right now. Stag? Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time? You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight? I won't. Ok. No. What party? What? FINE. Are you? Someone tried to kill me. NO?! Not that many. Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us. I promised I'd go right home after school. How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you. I don't know what I'm so scared of. You're the one always saying 'Just do it'. Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out. He says he loves me. I was desperate. It was gross. Does she fuck? But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'. You are 'sp fucking' wrong. You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars. You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now. You eventually have to talk to him. You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents. Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday. Mark Shale. Go sit next to him. No. You Miss Dunlop? Don't you think it's sick? You heard about that? This place is empty. Twenty eight years ago. Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers? What are you doing? Oh GOD IT'S HIM! Thanks for coming back for me. Go to the police station! My dad's down there! Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore. What? This party is sick. And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat. You flaunt some slut in my face. You break up with me because I won't fuck you. I'm making you feel like meat? What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong? Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now. So I should feel happy that he got away with it? I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit. My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist. I'll think about it. I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom. I do not. I'm not using him as an excuse. No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me. I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded. Did Sharon say no? Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party. Yeah. I think it's really sick. I did. I'm fine. What? I got to get home. I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago. Cut it out. NO! THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them. Who was the fourth? The principal? You're not telling me something. The men. Do any of them still live around here? Who were they? The word is Mob. How could you? And the police did nothing? People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'? Why not? You didn't believe her? Attacked how? I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead. Wait. Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me. Who is she? The library. I'll be fine. No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen. No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight. That's what he said. I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer. Yeah. Who is she? Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman? I need to ask you something. Mom? Hi mom. His mother's an only child. On what side of the family? Kenny's aunt? Yeah. Yes?This will relax her. Did you warn her? Well? She just turned off her light. What happened? Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have... Yes. Mr. Sisler was one of them. Two men left town right after it happened. Who? I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd. I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town. EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY. They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today.... They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'. No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged. She was raped. At least that's what she claimed. Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors. What? Don't make me order you. She's nobody you should be concerned with. I want you to come home with me right now, Jody. Where are you going? Not that I know of. I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind. Did he say anything else about her? What? I don't know. Where did you hear that name. Lisa Sherman? You can ask me anything. Yes? Hi princess.You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different. Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old? Not at all. In fact, I thought about going. Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day. Everyone's getting ready for the party. Follow me. They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for? Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?You're not? Daddy.... Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety. Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on. I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go. Unless he makes a move during seventh period. It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time. Especially not your dad. You can't tell your parents. Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard? Mark invited me to the party. Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what? You ok? The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could. You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale. There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night. OK. increase the peace. I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference. Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . . That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend. No! Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me. Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you. Oh nice save. I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties. He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him. You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you. You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff. What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?' No! That's his table. Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years. The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too. I don't watch him eat everyday. Why? Who? You're the one who's hand is shaking. So are you. No, you keep one. Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one. You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick. Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben. And she didn't?What? What are you doing? I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem. What? You ok?ROD! Unfair?! Rod! I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod. I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out. If sheep don't count. Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming. What? Maybe you better just drive me home. I said no.
