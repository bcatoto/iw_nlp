Sheriff, I don't... I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE! IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK! I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid? ...I meant your food. Hey, Sheriff. How's everything? 'Kay, good. Bye, then... Hmm. So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet? They're fine... you miss it? Oh. How come? No, I was just... How you doing? "Banners?" I don't think I am. I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but... Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think. ...what're you saying? I'd rather not... This is really awkward... I better go check on them. WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG! I'm sorry. I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something. I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?! I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am. "Thirty-two?" Umm, I don't think that... I am? ...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here? Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs. I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something. I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband... ...I... I know what you are. ...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something. This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together... Umm... yes. Back home. Yes, ma'am. It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background... Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista. Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but -- It's not true. He was set up. I gotta go. Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this. What are you talking about? Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note? Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me... Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it? All the time... Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit. Are you and Larry happy? I gotta go make dinner. Yeah, me too. He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it. Maroon. I stole it. What? Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year... It's all right. No... what about your sister? I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar... Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style! Did you watch it yet? ...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about. ...George. I do. My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime... Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord... Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane... My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been? No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I... ...I'm sorry. Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't... I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?! David, please -- What do you mean? What did I do to you... Why are you doing this to me? David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second? Ad lib? I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it? Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise... ...but I love listening to you, so that's okay... It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something... I know, that's why we were meant to be together... No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot. Was this before Leslie? Before us?... You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me. She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men... So where are we going? I know. It's up to us. Of course. I just want everything to be perfect between us. For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year. I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old. You told me that two hours ago. Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up... She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me. Lyla's very nice. Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here? Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain. Why do they keep calling you George? I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words. There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared! He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable! You knew Del?! No, Del. The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat -- But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life. We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now... And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David. We were engaged. ...of course you do. You don't remember me? I don't know. It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives. I came for love... Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del? Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new. Oh, I know. So, who're these clients? I got you, Del... Or the vitamins? Or the...? ...like the water purifiers? I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax. I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but... Sure you don't want any salad? What was that? I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and -- Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath. So, call me when you -- It's not really a good time, guys... Ahh, look, right now's not very... Roy! What are you doing here? It was Chloe... Yes. Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting! What're you doing here, Roy? You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem... Make sure it's elevated... I'm great, good, content. What happened to your arm, Roy? Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning... To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me... Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it. You made out alright. Like Rome? I'll go to the Hospital. No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon. Dr. David Ravell. How did you know? No. Loma Vista. Oh. I mean, except for that. Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good... I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop... I left my husband two days ago. That's horrible! Did you love it? Europe? The Europe? This is my first time out of Kansas. Los Angeles, California. I'd slap his face. Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess. Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it... I begged him to let me put that on! ...did I win some contest? I married a car salesman. Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie -- Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it? I don't think so. Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did. There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God... I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't... Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there... You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh... I have to leave now. ...this is your sweater, right? I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know. Oh, he does that. It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George. Rosa, so you've met David? All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that. You should have a little faith in people. Rosa... Are you sure I can borrow this? No, almost never. Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before. To a party in the Hollywood Hills. Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know... He is real. Oh, God! You scared me! Yes... Looking for someone? Umm... What are those for? ...okay. Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break. Fine. HE IS REAL!! Why'd you help me in the first place? If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money? Shhh! I heard you the first time. I have no idea what you're talking about. What? Where was he?! Who? You said in L.A., anything goes. How many men have I talked to? Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you. David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm... No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia... It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head... Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated. I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie. His wife. You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place. Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.' Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes? The Five? Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County... Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men... It's lovely... I really like your aquarium. The one you were telling me about? No, that's not, I couldn't... No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner. It's something I had to do. For David. I came for love. My fianc� is here. I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas. LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD! I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once. He has no heartbeat!...who doesn't? If it helps bring her back, be my guest... No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this... Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile. Oh, five years, give or take.If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me. I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry. Betty was a lovely child. This is Betty at twelve.You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you... Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived... Worse. What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be? Piss off, Merle. So how you gonna find him, Betty? You mean... George McCord, the actor? What's his real name? I s'pose his name's David Ravell. Nice move. Cedars Sinai? Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas... Really? No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me. Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage -- Sure I loved it! It was great. I should call you Dorothy. When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went. And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go? When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy. Where you headed, Betty? I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any. If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him. Shut up, Merle... Williams. So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you? He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick. What's the matter here?Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels. Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright... You must be joking. I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess... How's things at the Tip Top? Great. Good. Content... Need something else? You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something. Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will. He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back. Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!... No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley? What did you say? I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway. Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight... No... before that. Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too. You're wastin' your time, Roy.She called you 'George,' George. No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you? I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer. I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it... But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name? Then do as you're told. Get her back. Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident. You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer. This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months. I SAID FORGET IT! All right, everybody! That's ten minutes! Is there a problem, George? What the hell's going on? "Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember? Actually, she was my discovery... just like you. I said I'll think about it. I'll think about it. I don't know, George... No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember? We know that... I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good. Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do... Funny, that's just what I was thinking... Are you sure you want to encourage this? No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"? Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy? Loma Vista? You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?" God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of? Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again? So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County. So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name? What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?These guys are here to help you, Betty. Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise. Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this... What?! That you had something to do with it? Your husband?! What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on... Where are you going? What are you doing? Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George! Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital? Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is? No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral... But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him! Betty, you are one-of-a-kind... This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want? I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools. Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world? No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go? Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about? Does he know you think he's real? You still in love? Were you with him this whole time? You never know who you'll see. Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with... So what do you say? Can we be friends? This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid. I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can. I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL! IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!! You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character! I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you. I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!! Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?! ON TELEVISION!! Cut the shit, will you! Doctor David Ravell. Guess who I saw today. I was talking about what you could wear! Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me! Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that? "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out? Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever... One of us should. ...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories... We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission. Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy... Her 'head'?! You're making this up... God, that's awful! He has a wife?! What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people! Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit. You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy... So, how'd it go today? You find him? Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want! We're still on for tonight, right? Just look for the really crowded road and follow that. Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five... Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits. Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat... No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street... I got this apartment with a guy. Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay? You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down. Man, that is love. 'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him? So why'd you come to L.A.? You don't sound like you're from here. ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!! You're hurting him!! What are you doing? Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air. I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it. David Ravell. She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas. Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself? Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.Betty! Listen to me! Del is ... Do what? Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy. Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me? Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright? Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine. Well, you are. All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are? Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose. Let me know if you need anything, okay? Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday... Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive! What? The LeSabre! Aahhh... So what color is it? You sure? Maybe next week we could... I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon. Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast. Oh, Betty -- Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort... It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her. Is this Neighborly Life Insurance? Mr. Campbell? I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around... "A Reason to Love." No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back. No. Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it... I wish I could help you, but I can't.
