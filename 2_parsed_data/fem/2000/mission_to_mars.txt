Nice try, Nick. Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls  his own strikes. Thousand bucks make  it interesting? Good. Bring some balls. ...just not sure how I feel about  NASA allowing couples to go on this  type of mission together. Nothing personal, Terri. It's just  that, well, it's kind of a funny  feeling for those of us staying  behind. All the research shows that marriage  will provide stability on these long  duration trips. Then they haven't studied some of  the couples I've known. Anybody seen Jim McConnell? I don't think he's coming. God, that poor man. How's he doing? Totally losing it, from what I hear.  Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her  grave almost every day. They say he could lose mission status. Oh, that's so sad. That is just so  tragic. You go to a routine physical  one day, and wham. After all those years of training,  too. It was their whole dream. Must be a pretty funny feeling for  Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna  be in the history books. First man  on Mars... He's not coming, Luke. Your last night with us, too. I love you too, baby. But maybe you  should spend some time with Bobby. Up in his fort. We were afraid you wouldn't come. All the way out in Galveston? Spoil it? He's been going crazy  looking for you. Don't try to change the subject. Very funny. We're talking about  dancing lessons. Before my sister's  wedding. Woody, we're a married couple. Would  it kill you to invite me out on the  floor once in awhile? I'm not talking about shuffling your  feet around while you grab my butt.  I mean real dancing. Cha-cha, rhumba,  jitterbug -- I'm serious. We've got two more months  in this training rotation, but just  as soon as we get home, we're starting  lessons. If we never dance, people  will think there's something wrong. You are such a lug. Control, this is Cockpit. Who says report to Micker? What about the crew? Someone's alive. What did Luke mean by a "low sound?" Luke must be in pretty bad shape if  he hasn't blasted out of there in  the Earth Return Vehicle. That thing's  designed so even one crew member  could fly it back to Earth. I guess now we have our answer to  the effects of long-term  interplanetary travel on the human  mind. The answer is Phil. I'll take what I can get. Phil -- No. It just means there was nobody  left to bury him. What if you opened up your meal packs  and found that, instead of putting  in everything but red ones, they'd  made a mistake and put in only red  ones? How did you ever pass the psych  evaluation? I'll get you guys for this. Hey, c'mon, what if I'm right? It's our sister planet! Maggie, why does this have to be  about us? Mars is a great opportunity  for pure science. We'll do the science. And we'll do  it very well. That's what we've  trained for. But what if there's  more...? In all our myths, in every  human culture, Mars has always held  a special attraction. What if that  means something? Only we don't  understand it yet... The universe is not chaos. It's  connection. Life reaches out for  life... This is what we were born for, isn't  it? To stand on a new world, and  look beyond it to the next one. It's  who we are. Delta V systems initialized. Engaged. Charged. Engaged. Charged and on-line Set What in God's -- Woody, seal the breech! Are you sure? Keep the pressure on! Jim, you've gotta get your spare  helmet from storage. We're losing pressure. You could  embolize. Jim, I don't -- Piece of cake? Seems OK. Couple of the tendons are  going to be a little tight for awhile.  Try to close your fingers, Phil,  nice and slowly. Go. Jesus, Jim -- if we don't make it --  if we miss the REMO... What're you looking for? Hey. When we get back? We really  will have to try this in the sim. There she is! Oh Jesus. Jesus... Woody!! Woody, that's not possible. You're  not going that fast. Woody -- It's gonna take half an hour to get  the REMO reoriented! Woody'll be...  He'll be in the atmosphere by then! We don't have time! No! We are going to -- I'll tell you what I'm not doing,  Woody. I'm not going to watch you  die. You'd do the same for me. I can do it! The hell I do. I'm gonna jet a little closer and  try again. I am not losing you. Woody...? Woody, nooooooo...!!! Woody, oh Woody, please God, no! Yeah. This is gonna take awhile to  get back to 100% capacity. Copy that. I've got busted filters  here, clogged intakes. Helluva cleanup  job, but so far no major damage. Jim...? Long term exposure to low gravity  can have an adverse impact on the  brain. He could be suffering from a  form of asphyxia. Thanks, Luke. Saw what? What is that...? DNA... that's a model of DNA! No way. It's missing the last pair  of chromosomes. See? The difference between a man and an  ape is less than three percent of  genetic material. But that three  percent gives you Mozart. Einstein. C'mon. There's a pair of scissors in  my medkit. The backup generator is salvageable,  and two of the solar panels. I'm  pretty sure I can get the oxygen  still back into production, too. So  we're not in such bad shape,  considering. Four. We just don't know enough about that --  that thing out there to take any  more chances. No. More like an invitation. Jim, are you sure you want to do  this? I've got good footing and no  obstructions. Let's check our -- It's solid again! We're trapped. Jim, what're you doing? You'll  depressurize! Above Mars atmospheric? That's  impossible. There's six psi in here... Nitrogen and oxygen. Hey, there may be some lethal trace  gasses I haven't picked up yet, or...  or... oh, the hell with it. Oh my God. Earth, when it was still Pangaea.  Before the continents separated. Oh my God. The Cambrian explosion. Almost six hundred million years  ago, there was a sudden expansion of  life on Earth. The first multi-celled  plants and animals appeared. No one  has ever understood why... Phil, we're here! We read you. Phil? Phil...? Then let's get the hell out of here! What? What are you talking about? We've  got to get home. I wish Woody were here to see this.  He would've wanted to go too, Jim. Take care, Jim. I can barely read you. Let's get the  hell out of here! I've lost the Base Camp beacon! No good! We're driving blind. Don't worry! I've worked with Phil  for four years! I know Jim gave him  a direct order, but he won't leave  without us. He got another ride. Dear God. Look at that.
