When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you. You had your coaches and your father for that stuff. It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games. That's ridiculous. I don't remember that. Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know. Oh, yes. The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife. So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume? What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you? Child, please. Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say. You're the one always turning your nose up at me. What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up? To go have sex with him? I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot. If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad. Don't curse. You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask? Find out where they're registered and send them a gift. His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me. To that stewardess? How is he? I can manage. Hi. Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game. He's still at the bank. Don't be defensive. I'm just surprised to see you. Monica. What are you doing here? Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that? Nothing. So good luck. Sure. In between all the other things I have to do. Child, take a bite. Taste this. Watch your mouth. That's not funny I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing. Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear? I'm lucky I found it. Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage. Oh, all that work. Monica, what did you do? Okay. The blue. How is she alright looking the way she does? She needs to stop running around like a little boy. Okay. You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold. So you're still breast-feeding? So that means it's alright for you to act like that? ...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour. I just need to lay down. I've been running around all day. When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth? Really? Well, come on, then. Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do. Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about. Oh, me too. I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta. Well, thanks again. This was really nice of you. Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive. You belong on the court. Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on. You're just scared. I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be. I believe in you. You just have to get back on the court. Like you'd get back on a horse. To do what you love. Baby, don't talk like that. Your rehab's going well. You'll be back before you know it. Why not? Four days. Get used to it, babe. What? Yes, we appreciate that. Monica. You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you. Hello. Why are you up? Get in bed. I'm so sorry. No one would switch flights with me.He's fine. The doctor said it was okay. Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat. What'd you do? But you use potato? Are you okay? Yeah, once I cut them off. Why? Too many times. Hey. You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date. If you were tore up I would not be claiming you. Trust. You do. I told him you looked like me. And he's fine, girl. This brother from my college. No. I know... I found you someone. So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet? Just try and chill a little bit, alright. You need to. She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind. Like you don't give her a hard time. Mom's going to hate it. That too tight?What are you talking about? It mattered, Mom. That's all you cared about. I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two. What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers. I do. You never stood up for yourself. Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because of that. I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal. All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table. And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas. And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge. That's not it. I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart. Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not. I wasn't Lena. I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume. No I don't. So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot? There you go. I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy. Whatever. So what do I do? Maybe she is. Yeah, you met her? Engaged. Yeah. Can't wait to see him I just saw Quincy. Need any help? What? Dad around? Didn't know I needed a reason to come home. What? What? You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say. I can't eat before a game. Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron... I won't. I'm a lesbian. nothing. Pants. I hate it. Ah, Mom. Nothing. It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me. I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game. Thanks. Coach... What? I can take it. Wait... Uh-huh. My mouth is kinda dry. Sorry. Huh? Sort of. Oh, sorry. You're cold? They ever love you back? You ever been in love? I don't know how to walk in heels. Yeah, right. Oh, great. How'd you get him to say yes? He's in college? Damn, Lena... Who is he? Mom tell you to do this? Found? I'm not some charity case. Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker. No one's forcing her. Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you... Always on my ass, anyway. No. You shoot like a girl. That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter. Dad. What are you doing here? Chances are there's still a chance. The coach from USC is going to be at the championship. What? I was just showing emotion. The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench. Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me. You ever think about going back? Just not my type, I guess. I wouldn't know. How's that been? Just like that? You mean my championship trophy? My bad. How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian? What's up, Sidra. What's that? I know. Thanks. But? What's up? Didn't have to try very hard. I was just playing ball. Thanks, Sidra. What's up with that? Coach hates me, doesn't she? If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present. So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you. You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to. I know why you broke up with me in college. And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too. So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you. So you're gonna bitch up? Your heart. One game. One-on-one. I'll play you. Better late than never, right? Then why are you so upset? I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago. What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away. It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing. From basketball. You asked me what was missing. We need to talk. It doesn't matter, alright. Just leave it alone. Something was just missing. Why do you keep asking me that? It's a trip, you know? When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way. Wow. Like what? You're serious. And you tore up your knee. Rehab is tough. You had a rough couple years, that's all. It just isn't. That's okay. I'm probably, you know, busy. Strong enough to get you down the aisle? So...how's the knee? Who's this guy I always see her around? You visiting? Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything. Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know? I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile. Actually, I don't... Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine. It was always messing up. Oh yeah? Kiss my ass. Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical. We won the championship. I forgot, "Q-man." I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve. What are the doctors saying? I'm fine. My dad said you tore your ACL. Shouldn't you be lying down, or... No, it looks good. I mean, it's cool. I was. I see your peach fuzz finally grew in. Uh huh. So that's it, just forget about us? When did you decide all this? You're what? You don't think so? How are you going to tell me what I have time for? I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this. What? How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me? If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you. I'm a ballplayer. If anyone knows what that means it should be you. I never asked you to choose. If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting! That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew. What was I supposed to do? What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else? So you fucked around to prove a point! Cheap date. Talk to your new girlfriend. Are you out of your mind? What the hell's going on? Woman... Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer. You weren't at my game. Hey. Fine...Maybe I'll come by later. You want to go talk? Who's nobody? Who was that? he's just playing, Q... Sorry about your game. I've been trying to find you all day. Hey. Quincy... I mean, I can stay a few more minutes. Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up. I...can't. Nothing. Why don't we walk to my dorm? You're not stupid. She understands. I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you. I won. Yo, where's the "D"? Kiss my booty. Give me the ball. What? What are we playing for? That was so weak. I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me. I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me. Quit. I said fine. Fine, Quincy. You do see me standing here, right? Whatever, big head. What'd it say? You finish the reading for E-con? I know, right? It was on my bed when I came in. Can you just...? What? Why? Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied. So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit? Mulholland Drive. Early night for you, isn't it? So you took Shawnee, huh? He ain't Spalding. Yeah. Hey. You either. Yeah. Good. Didn't know you cared so much. Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass. But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady". I'm a ballplayer, okay. A ball player. I'm warning you, don't tempt me. Would you watch the damn road? When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose. I'm not the one who put this scar here. Who said I'm not getting recruited? Who's Spalding? I don't. Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho. But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything. And? She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone." She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail. Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you. Please. Look, big head, I'll be at your car. A ride home. Way to hoop. Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse. You're stupid. And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA. I don't have to do what you say. So? I want to ride my own bike. For how long? Okay. How bout Twinkies? My mom won't ever buy them. I don't like flowers. What do I have to do? I'd just tell my sister, Lena. I don't care. One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth. What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High? I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic. He works at a bank. My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different. I just can. Uh huh. It's this big hole. You could almost see bone. Told you I was nice. I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA. One, up. Give it yourself. There's so many I just can't keep track. No. Hey.You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house. You're a caterer? It was the least we could do. And I love to cook. Okay? ...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then... Happy. And he won't want to see you. He tore his ACL. The doctor'll be back in a minute. Not great. Fine, then how many nights home is that? You said you'd think about going back to get your degree. I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy. If you don't talk to him... I came second to the NBA. I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job. At one in the morning? You just got back from a four game road trip. With who? We should head over. Zeke. Guess I should have been telling your father. Quincy, please... Just...leave it alone. Whose truth are you talking about? Guess he talked to you. I'm fine. You scared me. Later when? Where's your dad? Still the man. How was your game? You hearing me? I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught. They see you, they see dollar signs. Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls. I look like some hoochie to you? I found it on your floor. What is this? Yeah. What?I don't wanna look fast. Thanks, girl. Well, can you give him this for me? C'mon, girl, you live next door. Who's been creeping? Your hair looks so cute like that. Hey, girl.Sometimes. But what's the alternative, not playing? You remember big Toni? She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore. I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here. We just played in the championship game. It doesn't get much sweeter than this. Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women. They can't get enough of me. What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything? So what are these Spanish guys like? It's better. Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money. I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball. Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years. Yeah, four years ago. They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people. I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock. Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed. So they fire me. Can you take that damn thing off the table. I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house. Well, what do you know. Never let a freshman take your spot. Just one word of advice for next season. But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock. No buts. Took a lot of heart to take that charge. Just wanted to say good game. You were trying to make me look bad. That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman. Besides. I've been starting point the last two years. Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot. Hey, don't take it personal. And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other. We're teammates, okay? She hates all freshmen.
