No. There's no one here. Better luck next time. Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately. Her dog, yes. You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well. I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did. And your wife left you. That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently? How long have you been smoking marijuana? How long have you been having them? So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand. You did.It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence. No, it's not that, it's... I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep. Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book. It beats 'What's your major?' I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner. I told you, Sewickly Heights. Who does? Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in. At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet -- He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one. I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so. I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck. Grady! I thought we were going to talk. Last night. The one in your office? It's the best one for naps. His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside. James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but... Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember. Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it. I would if I knew where I was taking him. I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home. So what are you going to do? And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am. I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down. James'll know about George Sanders. Ail right. By the way, his friend...? Just checking. I think so... What about you? I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage. I haven't heard of half of those. Just a few then. The big ones. Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how. Are you riding with me, James?It's a bathtub. What she's standing under. He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a... You mean because his career's ruined and all? That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit. What's that? Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind? Tony. Now that I'm home. Sure it is. Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed. Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing? I need a ride. Who's he barking at now? That's a nice greenhouse. Why yes. How did you know? Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.I know, but sometimes... Did you just make that up? It didn't come up. I told Walter. Some times... Oh? Dozens. It's very sad. And you're old. Oh, Grady. You're such a putz. Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all? I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady? I said it didn't sound like you. He told me. And what do you think you might have said? You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady? It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning. This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady. Are you sure you parked it there? Grady. And the jacket? I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady? It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed. I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong... What's he doing out there? Who's that sitting in your car? That... and you. No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet. I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore. Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk. All right. Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere? Are you limping? Why are you limping? I'm kidding. Hello? Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom. Did you confess? You heard? How? Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too. I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick. I love you, Grady. Pow. Heavy. Smells like gunpowder. Who's gun is that? No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying... ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady. No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way? She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby. You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her. Don't. I know what you're going to say. Almost. Want to sit up? What's the matter? You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right? I guess you're going to have to chew it off then. Neither do I. And? Are you going to tell him? Has he asked to see the book yet? My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she? Is that Cristaile? So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple. She's left before... I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising. I'm sure. I'm pregnant. You go first. Walter just got it back from the framer today. Well then. I'd better show you. Terry -- That's funny. I need to talk to you, too. Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp. I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things. I got the message you called. Professor Tripp. You want to keep him happy. I doubt it, darling. I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else. Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady. Goodbye, Grady. Are you there to not reconcile with her? Just what? Doing a little dusting? With Emily? You're in Kinship? Where are you, Grady? An elevator? Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
