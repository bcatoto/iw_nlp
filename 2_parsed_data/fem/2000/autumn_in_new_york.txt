Well, you certainly didn't. No, I see how you could feel this  way. Of course I do. It's human. But  what I don't get is why you'd want  to announce it so quickly. I mean,  we just met. Feelings change. You  don't even know me. Oh, really? Well, you're wrong. I don't. -- and for weeks I sat by her bed  and cried. I told her I loved her  and I begged her not to leave me.  All I could think about was what I'd  lose if she died. And then one  night... she was in really bad pain...  I stopped thinking about myself for  a second and I thought about her. I stopped crying. I said goodbye.  And in less than an hour Ella was  gone. It's so sad. I really think it's possible to hold  a person back... cry them back...  from dying. That's what I did to  Ella and I'll never do it to anyone  else again. I hope no one ever does it to me. So what do you know about her? Shit. Dolly! The bulb burned out! Dolly? See? Surprises suck! Oh, Wills, please, not again. It's  our third date and we're already in  a rut. Oh, I do -- except for the fact that  there isn't a single thing on the  menu I can eat. Fine then. We'll go, I'll get big,  fat, and horrible, and it'll serve  you right. Why do you say that? Fine, Mr. Keane. Just dandy, sir, thanks! This way, please. Look, I have no right to say this,  okay? And you can fire me if you  want, but in the six weeks we've  been open you've brought in six  different women -- tonight makes  seven -- and it's really starting to  get to me. I have to greet them! It's like  working at a dog shelter! I'm afraid  to learn their names or even smile  at them because I know any minute  they could be put down! It is? Seriously? So I'm not fired? You guys! Let me think! Okay. Okay. Very funny! Actually, any moment now  you're gonna turn straight and fall  at my feet. The only time he falls at your feet  now is when he wants to borrow your  Prada loafers. Is that Wills Keane? It sure as hell is and he hasn't  changed a bit! You little fool, it's Dolores Talbot.  Dolly! Yeah, I know, time's kicked my ass  but good. Come on, Romeo, let's bury  the hatchet. Give me a hug. Careful  of the cocktail. So what the hell're you doin' around  here? Last I heard you were out in  earthquake country blowin' the family  fortune. Good for you! -- and you know how bouncer's get.  He's like, "That's the worst fake  I.D. I've ever seen." And I'm like,  "Yeah? Well, you have the worst dread- extensions!" And then just when -- He's here. And he's staring at me  again. No way! Don't! Wait a few seconds, then go to the  bathroom. He's beautiful. And much older. Okay, look. He's as old as my dad! Sure, L.A.'s okay if you're a cactus  or a lizard, but if you're a New  Englander, your soul dries up and  blows away like a god damn leaf. So what're you doin' now? You owned  some restaurants out there, didn't  you? And so, after all that, we pay our  cover, we get in, and it's totally  heinous! Nothing but losers and -- Oh, shit. What? Kids! I want you to meet an old chum  of mine, the owner of this fine  establishment -- Wills Keane! And that over there's the birthday  girl -- my granddaughter, Charlotte. You bet. She got her height from her  dad. But her talent's all Katie's. Made it herself from scratch. That  one, too. Honey, show 'im. Thanks. Thanks. Twenty years old and never been... Shut up! Same here. You're not really into him, are you? Hey, Dolly, how do you know him? From Newport. Old friend of your  mom's. Okay, bitch, I'm ready! Oh my God, I'm so sorry! Wait. Who  is this? My friend Simon, actually. He always  calls me the morning after to sort  of... you know... sum everything up. Kinda cool, kinda creepy. Anyway,  you wanna speak to my grandmother? Really? Wow. Sounds fun. Okay. Uh-huh. But that doesn't necessarily -- Any particular style? A week or two. Oh. Wow. Okay. I don't really have one. I usually  just make them for friends. Really? Wow. Yeah? I know. I know. Bye. See, now you got me worried. You slept alone last night. You must  be sick or somethin'. You want me to  call a doctor? Sure, if his folks could have afforded  it. Oh, is that what that is? I figured  there was a dirty diaper somewhere. So much for that turned leaf. "She's young. She's hot. I'm on the  verge of menopause. Why not go for  it?" Why don't you mark what isn't  important? That way you'll save ink. Why don't you sew your mouth to my  butt? That way you'll stop annoying  me. Now, now, if you two kids can't play  nice -- God, I hate school. Oh, come on, just last week, you  said you were on a roll. You loved  it! Well, now I'm on the rag and I hate  it. I think you're incredibly lucky. I'd  love to be going to college. Am I the most spoiled brat in the  world or what? Spoiled brats don't even ask questions  like that. What do you think? That you're the most beautiful person  in the entire world. KEANE! Oh, really? Thank you. He's waitin' for you, Miss Fieldin'. I couldn't get a cab, so I took the  subway... only it was an express and  it didn't stop at -- I know... I'm so sorry... I -- I could leave and come back. I can't. I'm soaked. I wanted it to be a tiny poem. Why? Like this? It's okay? Are you sure? From Ella. The woman whose memorial  you crashed. Uh-huh. And the next time I saw you,  you were on the cover of New York  magazine. And I had to pick a place  for my birthday. So... Of course he moved back. I mean,  he'd already seduced every A- and B- list actress in town. What was left  for him? The C-list? Exactly. But if what I hear is true and he's  shopping for a bride, I can tell you  one thing -- he's barking up the  wrong tree there. Why do you say that? Good wives are rarely found up cherry  trees. I met Ella in the fourth grade. She  was my teacher at the Little Red  School House. We stayed friends after  she retired. She taught me how to  cook and sew... speak Italian...  basically enjoy life, have fun --  that's what she was best at... even  when she knew she was dying. The most important thing she did was  introduce me to poetry. She believed  it was the highest form of art and  that everything we say and do should  aspire to it. My mom and my dad's. After they died,  Dolly was so devastated she pretty  much gave up on everything. It was  like if something that tragic could  happen, there was no way she was  ever gonna care about anyone else  ever again. Including herself. She  wasn't a horrible parent... she didn't  abuse me or anything... she just  ignored me. She was more like a weird  landlady than a grandmother. For a long time I kinda thought that,  too, and I made excuses for her, but  now I don't. I was seven years old  and I needed her and she wasn't there. Oh, no, come on! I love this stuff!  Don't you? Didn't you grow up on it? Ancient! Have fun! I had to come. I work at the Met.  What's your excuse? Sort of a date. With Wills Keane, right? You know him? Just by reputation. A major womanizer, right? That's what they say. I'm Lisa. Charlotte Fielding. Anyway, I should keep mingling. But  it was nice to meet you. Same here. Lisa something. Us. God, you talk like you're a hundred  and sixteen! He asked nonchalantly. God, it must be a relief. To finally deliver that speech to a  woman and actually have it apply to  her. No, because coincidentally I am all  those things you just said. And more. I'm a "unique". At least that's what  my yoga teacher says. He says there  are very few uniques in the world  and I'm one of them. You, on the other hand, are what  he'd call a "typical." Uh-huh. And I can prove it. Want me  to? Come here. Closer. No, come on, really close. Perfect. Now watch very carefully. See? You're a typical. And for what you just did, most girls  my age would slap your face. Or ask  to be put in a cab. Lucky for you, I'm a unique. Boy, do you look guilty. Didn't anyone ever teach you that  it's bad manners to stare at a girl  when she's eating like a pig? Uh-oh. Here it comes. Okay. I know. I'm dying. What I said. Nobody thought I'd even  last this long. I could have put off telling you,  but I genuinely like you, so I wanted  to be clear... you know, right from  the start. Thanks, Olivia! A real charmer, isn't he? How are you on Cambodian money units? Are you okay, old man? You look kinda  woozy. Is there a doctor in the house? Hey. Look on the bright side: if I weren't  sick, there's no way we could hang  out together. I'm serious. You'd be scared of  hurting me and I'd be scared you  were just using me for my perfect  young body. And then our friends would say we  were just into each other for weird  psychological reasons. You know,  because I'm looking for a daddy  substitute and you're looking for  someone you can feel superior to so  you won't have to confront how scared  you are of real intimacy -- and, of  course, they'd be right and eventually  we'd break up. But since I'm so sick it doesn't  really matter what deep-seated  weirdness has brought us together  because there's no way we can possibly  screw each other over... or up...  because that takes time. And I don't  have much left. So considering everything, don't you  think we should just sort of chill  out, forget I'm sick, and enjoy what  we have... right now... no strings...  just this... until it ends? 'Cause  that's really all I have to offer. Think about it, okay? But not too  hard. Last night was so incredibly hot. By the way -- it was my first time.  And I picked you for the job. I hope  you're flattered. I don't believe it! I don't believe  it! Really? Better put some ice on that. Girlfriend, you are so incredibly  cool! Okay, now tell us everything! Don't  leave anything out! Well, well. She'll be right down. She's upstairs,  gildin' the lily. Excuse the mess. My maid died fourteen  years ago and it's been simply  impossible to replace her. She did  windows and spoke English. Well, aren't they loverly. Care for a cocktail? Who's she? So that would be a "no." What can I say? Time's a thief. One  day you're rich as an Arab, the next  you're lucky if you can afford a god  damn can of pistachio nuts. How about that, huh? That was the  summer you two -- Who'd have guessed what time had in  store for her, huh? Look at that  smile. Then again, time loves some people.  Like you, for instance. Oh, time's  just wild about you. Just as handsome and charming as  ever. And still up to the same old  tricks. First time you came to pick up Katie,  you brought me flowers. Just like  those. Flower the mother; then deflower the  daughter. But Katie was too smart  for you... Aw, why the hell don't you leave her  alone? Christ, she's sick! What? What's wrong? You look like your mom is all. I did! I just didn't think it would  take so long! It is when you're sitting by the  phone. You wanna know how I knew? I am, but no -- it's because of my  birthday wish. I know, but I wished that whatever  happened... you know, with my  illness... I'd go out with a bang.  Nothing heavy. No violins. No  melodrama. Just fun. A total  adventure! Wow, it's getting exciting already. "Lord, I do fear  Thou'st made the world too beautiful  this year!  My soul is all but out of me, -- let  fall  No burning leaf; prithee, let no  bird call!" No, that would be a thing! I don't  want to do any thing today. I want  to do no thing all day. Uh-huh. No thing at all. Way out! Both out. Possible. Only when I have money. I agree, and I promise I'll let you  give me something else, but not today. Soon. But I'm warning you, it's not  going to be anything material. That's right, but we're not gonna  talk about that. Because it's my rule. Yeah, because everybody always wants  to talk about miracles, or about  some genius quack-doctor, or their  friend's friend who went into  remission eating nothing but sunflower  seeds. It's boring and pointless. Don't start, okay? Now what I would enjoy is taking you  shopping. For clothes. I'm serious.  It's quality not quantity, you know. At work you should look perfect, but  in everyday life you need to delight  in disorder more. Don't you know? "A  sweet disorder in the dress kindles  in clothes a wantonness." It was true when that poem was written  three hundred years ago and it's  true today. Wouldn't it be fun to  look wanton occasionally? Totally. Accessories rule. But we  have to be careful. I don't want you  looking too young. Nothing's worse  than an old guy trying to look young. You know what I meant. Uh-huh. Perfectly imperfect! Hey, you're giving me the creeps.  Just spit it out. So I made the hat for myself? And you bought that dress for me? And you did all this just so you  could sleep with me? Why? I mean, why me? And sex seemed like the best way to  do it. Well, first of all, let me say, you  have great taste because that little  Dolce & Gabbana was to die for. And, second, don't ever lie to me  again. Seriously. There isn't a lie in the  whole world I'd rather hear than the  truth. I thought I told you to wait right  there! Well, I hope you didn't talk to  anybody! You know what would scare me right  now? This. Have I told you my latest motto? If it's scary, do it. I'm not sure that matters. Oh my God. You're scared, too. Your turn. What's the matter, old man? Can't  afford a gym? "Counting the beats,  Counting the slow heart beats,  The bleeding to death of time  In slow heart beats,  Wakeful they lie." If I could give you anything in the  whole world, that's what it would  be. Poetry. Special delivery! None. It's true. I see a guy with horns  growing out of his head and my knees  go weak. Don't come in! Don't! I'll be right out! You like hot cider? Charlotte made it. I just poured it  in the cup. Ta-da! Don't I look just like her? You have no idea who I am. "Hope is the thing with feathers  that perches in the soul." You dummy! Emily Dickinson! Only the  greatest American female poet ever! Uncultured swine. Wanna bet? When do I get to see your costume? Where're the girls? I thought you  were tucking them in! Guess who? No. I'll give you a hint. You dumped me. Just one more. Please? All right, but this is the last last  one! "Because I could not stop for Death,  He kindly stopped for me;  The carriage held but just ourselves  And Immortality.  We slowly drove, he knew no haste,  And I had put away  My labor, and my leisure too,  For his civility." "We passed the school where children  played  At wrestling in a ring;  We passed the fields of grazing grain,  We passed the setting sun." Sweet dreams? I had no idea I was so tired. They're down? And out. Where's Lucifer? Hey, no gossip! Holly's a valued  customer. Lemme at 'er! Hey, shouldn't one of your minions  be doing that? -- off to buy crack! Seen Beelzebub around? Uh-huh. Shit. You lost your horns. Uh-huh. Actually, I saw you at that memorial  service in Connecticut. Your eulogy  was beautiful. Thank you. Betsy Ross, right? You guessed it. No, I was just wondering if you had  sex with that woman. No, the answer to that's pretty  obvious. I meant tonight. On the  roof. That's what I was wondering. I  thought, "We're so happy he'd have  no reason to do it. And if he did do  it, he'd at least look guilty,  wouldn't he? But he doesn't. He looks  more relaxed than before the party  started." But then I thought, "He's a womanizer --  that's what they say." Funny word,  huh? Sounds like some sorta machine.  "And how do you get to be a womanizer?  Obviously by sleeping with lots of  different women for no good reason  and being really good at lying about  it." Let me finish. Anyway, there's something about being  sick right here -- -- that has made me acutely aware of  my heart. Nothing corny -- I mean,  literally... I feel every beat. I  know how sensitive it is. It reacts  to everything. If you're lying to me, I'll know it. Did you have sex with Wendy on the  roof? My God... oh my God. You hate yourself so much! What about you? Do you have anything  better? You know, maybe you're right. Maybe  this is the best time to end it.  Because I was actually starting to  love you, Wills, and that's the last  thing I ever wanted. Well, if it ain't the Belle of  Amherst. Seen that face before. You have? And for the same god damn reason. But you said Wills and my Mom were  just friends. Sure, but she was nuts about him.  The only reason she didn't sleep  with him is 'cause she was  sentimental. And smart. She wanted a  ring first. Why didn't he give her one? 'Cause he knocked up little Millie  Tyler instead. In Newport. At Bailey's  Beach. During the Labor Day clam  bake. Millie was your mom's best friend  from Nightingale. You had to hand it  to him. He sure knew how to make a  point. Why did he do that? Aw, who the hell knows? 'Cause the  moon was full. 'Cause life's short.  'Cause he's Wills Keane. I'll tell  you a little secret -- after that,  your Mom hated his guts, but your  dad never made her smile like he  did. 'Course your dad never made her cry  like that either. Why didn't you tell me any of this  before? Oh, I dunno... You never talk to me! You never try  to help me! Christ, look at me. I'm gonna tell  you what to do? Yes! You're my family. You're supposed  to take care of me. Aw, you wouldn't listen. That's the  thing about people -- they just do  what they want from the day they're  born till the day they die. No, that's you, Dolly! People who  have given up don't listen to other  people! People who want to die close  off! That's not me! I wanted your  help! I wanted to learn! Anything... anything you would ever  have told me, I would have listened  to! I promise. Aw, come on, honey. I can throw a  party and I can mix a gimlet. After  that, what the fuck do I know? Oh, Wills, it's beautiful! So functional! Is that stainless  steel? Oh, my God, it is! How are you, sir? Well, if the food's even half as  good as the moldings I'm in for a  very special treat. How are you this evening, sir? Are you sure? Okay, I'm chugging Scotch, gagging  on smoke, and losing my hearing! Now  why is this so good for me again?! Excuse me! Excuse me! Sorry! Excuse  me! What? What is it! Look what I found! Eric! Wow! God, long time no see! One night we  show up to rent Eraserhead and you're  just gone! It was such a drag! You know, having  to actually start paying to rent  movies! What's up? Ralph said you moved to  Rockland County! What does he do? Cool! So what're you doing now? Whoa, I don't believe it! She hasn't laughed in like a week! -- so everybody on the conference  call starts introducing themselves.  Ned Lewey, Paris Office. Takashi  Matsuo, Tokyo Office. Whoever, the  London Office. And then someone says,  "Will the architect from the New  York office please identify himself."  And I pipe up and say, "Well, guys,  I'm not a him or an architect. I'm  Patty Strauss and I'm head of East  Coast marketing." And there's like  total silence. It was hysterical! Of course. Thank you so much. I had such a great  time. Didn't you? Sorry to disappoint you. Well, I didn't expect you to show up  at my job. My boss thought you were a stalker. But you did. So you got my letter. What'd you do?  Freak out? Burn it? I was just blowing off some steam,  okay? I think I have the right. No. I didn't plan to come. Peter...  my husband... he agrees. He thinks  it's a futile exercise. But it turns  out I'm pregnant. Just a few months,  but -- Thanks. Anyway, I guess it made me  want to meet you. I've been a little  sentimental about parent-hood. In a lousy absentee sorta way, sure. Great. Nuts. She moved to Costa Rica  last summer. A guy, what else? He owns a charter  airline and wears sunglasses indoors.  I think he might be a gunrunner. You know, you're much better looking  in person than in photographs. I  always assumed Mom was exaggerating,  but she wasn't. Anyway... I should go... I really just wanted to meet you  and... maybe... I don't know... Nothing earth-shattering. Maybe just  to hear you say you were sorry. Okay. Thanks. Before... when you came in... who  did you think I was? You must like her an awful lot. Hey. So worried you fell asleep. What're  you doing here? How'd you get in? I didn't know I had a curfew. None of your business. So what is  it? What do you want? Cowardly. Why should I? Let's sleep. In the morning, we'll talk about  what a gigantic asshole you are. With Shannon and Simon and Eric. An old friend who used to work at  Blockbuster. Talked and drank. Simon and Shannon  finally went home. Eric and I hung  out. Stop. We'll talk about it tomorrow. And I honestly think I have a right  not to tell you. You're being nosy. You're worried about where he's been?  Give me a break! Oh, come on, what's the worst that  can happen? Well, I guess you could break a hip. How come? Not even close! It's not! It's adult! It's revenge!  And if you think it's bad not knowing  what I did -- well, it's even worse  knowing exactly what you did! Do me a favor, okay? Never ask me  again what happened with Eric. Just  accept the fact that you'll never,  ever know. And if that hurts, then  think about it next time you want to  cheat on somebody. What changed? What were you scared of? Well, for your sake, I hope I am. Judge you? Why would I? Screw the  age difference -- I like the new  you! Before Charlotte came along, do  you have any idea how hard it was to  get you to sit down for a Happy Meal? Uncle Wills, how come you don't get  married? I'm not Carla! I'm Molly! What about Charlotte? She's funny- pretty. It means funny and pretty. It's their  highest compliment. Yeah, what is it? When you realize that I'm God. Yeah. No big deal. Cramp in the old  fifth shakra! It's no big deal. I just  hyperventilated. Really. Hey. Stoned. Shhh. You still owe me a birthday present. Just 'cause I fainted is no excuse  for you to bail on your peacock pose. What? I've ruined you for other women. All part of my master plan. Do you wanna hear a story... a bedtime  story? Once upon a time, there was a woman  on a ship crossing the Atlantic and  her little boy got sick. Very sick.  And she said whoever saves my boy's  life... I'll name my next baby after  them. Well, they got into port and  they rushed her son to St. Vincent's  hospital... to here... and they saved  his life. And so the mother named  her next baby Edna St. Vincent Millay. And Edna grew up to be, as I am sure  you know, the second greatest female  poet in American history. You're a quick learner -- I like  that about you... "It may be, when my heart is dull,  Having attained its girth,  I shall not find so beautiful  The meagre shapes of earth,  Nor linger in the rain to mark  The small of tansy through the dark." I am so pretentious... Uh-oh. Heavy, heavy... No. No violins. I'm fine. Go home...  sleep... It just didn't seem real and now  that it is, I hate it! It's so unfair! Fare is what you pay on the train to  Jersey. Fair is the place that smells  like manure where, if you're real  lucky, you win a blue ribbon for  your home-made pickles. Fair is a  sky without a cloud and a face with  a mark. Fare is food. What fair isn't  is everything else. What is it? I'd be happy to do it. Dad, I'm really sorry she's sick. You never talk about my mother. Talk about her. Everything. All I remember is that  she smelled like vanilla, loved to  read to me, and was really good at  cutting up fruit. I couldn't believe  she didn't cut her fingers off. I've seen pictures, dummy. Much better. Neither can I. Who? Did you know she was in love with  you? Were you in love with her? Why? Because she was the only girl  in Rhode Island who wouldn't sleep  with you? Then why did you screw her best friend  on Labor Day? It's just a question. Well done. But why're you like that? What is  it? I mean, you weren't born that  way. But I want everything from you, Wills.  I rely on you in every way. So the only reason you don't dump me  is because I'm sick? Because you  know that it's all going to be over,  anyway? I didn't know you could sing! No, I don't. Do you? You call that a rose? It looks more  like a hand grenade! No way! I'm too pricey! Hello, Sunshine! I've got him! His name's Tom Grandy. Harvard  undergrad. Columbia Medical School.  He's at the Cleveland Clinic. I know,  I know. But don't laugh. It's one of  the best in the world. He did his residency at the Brigham  in Boston... his cardiac surgery  training at Cleveland. He was so good they kept him on and  within three years he was chief of  the program. He travels a lot. Spends lots of  time lecturing. I got you an  appointment tomorrow at twelve-thirty.  Don't be late. He only has fifteen  minutes. The surgeon that recommended him  said, and these are his words not  mine, "Don't let his appearance fool  you. He's brilliant and has balls  the size of your head." By the way -- where were you today? When you called I assumed you were  at the restaurant, but when I called  back later, Jesus said you hadn't  been in all day. Why? Oh, really? Sexual or professional? Hey! How do you feel about Christmas? I doubt it. What trip? I wouldn't really call that a trip. I thought we had a deal. Lying. You were in Ohio yesterday. But you know I don't want that! You  know I've signed papers that -- It isn't your decision! No! I told you right from the start  how I felt and you went behind my  back! You lied and -- I won't give people hope when there  isn't any. Now I know why you hurt so many women.  Because you always knew if you held  on to one of them, you'd never let  go. When we met, I was so lonely. But I  didn't even know it. I'd been alone  so long.. almost forever... But now we have each other. Oh, what would I do, Wills? What  would I do if you weren't here? Where  would I be? I'll do whatever I have to! I'll  tear up the papers! Whatever you  want! Tell the doctor! Because... I  really do want... I don't want to  leave you! Wills?! How long was I asleep? Wow. And I'm still tired. What're you doing in there? Liar! What're you doing?! Oh no! You didn't! This I've gotta see! What have I done to you? No... I saved you for them... Just you, Doctor! Actually, to be honest, Peter's more  than a little freaked. I mean, how  could he not be? He's twenty-six.  His first child. A baby girl, no  less. Nothing really prepares you  for it. He said it's the first time since we  got married that he's actually  realized what marriage is. That it's  forever. That he can't just pick up  and run away to Nepal or something  if we have a fight. That he's part  of the cycle of things now. That  he's gonna die some day. That it's  the next generation's turn to take  the stage. So what about you, Mr. Keane? You  ready to be a grandpa?
