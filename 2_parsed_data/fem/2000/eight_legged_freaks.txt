Oh shit. Don't antagonize her, you guys. Can't you give 'em a break? But, Mom! Shut up, dork. Do you get off on humiliating me? I'm just trying to have fun. Don't you remember what it's like to grow up here? You are so over protective. You need to start trusting me. Why do you hate him so much? Maybe I want to stay. I could get pregnant by nineteen. Then divorce with a couple of kids I can't handle. Slap on a badge and be a trailer trash sheriff. Maybe you're not gay after all. You can't take your eyes off his butt. Did you pop him one? Why? Because she stopped you from givin' Wade another pop? I am. Oh something's broken? What else is new? You need to pay these by the end of the month. Another vein of iron pyrite? I'm glad you like my bologna sandwiches. Maybe you should talk to Wade. Honey, if he really does have a buyer... Your daddy wanted to    get rich. I don't think he cared    how that happened. If he was     still alive, maybe he'd sell those    mines. You're right... I'm just worried about how we're going to pay these bills. Ladies first. Why do you need to do that as six in the morning!? Do you hate me that much!? You've been saying that for six months! Woo-hoo! Haven't you had enough of that? I don't know. I want to do something with my life, Bret. Help people. Maybe med school is still an option. Thanks, Mom. Slow down... I do! I don't feel... I don't want to lose my virginity in the front seat of a monster truck. No... I guess... I'm just not ready. Then call them! Have a menage a trois! Please, Bret... Please don't... I told you to back off! Screw you, Bret. I'm going home. I can't believe my mom was right about you. Do you know how embarrassing that is? What are you doing home? Try the basement. I wanted to surprise you with a special dinner. Turkey De La Gladys. Not as good that way. I'm not kidding. I got more action than those chicks on VIP. So when I tell you Sam thinks your butt is U.S.D.A. choice... Don't tell me you don't think she's a fox. See you for dinner. No. Don't worry about it. Nothing. Nothing happened, alright! Spider... Mike... Spider... There aren't enough wine coolers in the world to calm me down! Outside?    You want to go outside? You dork! Mom! They're gonna come in after us? You go, Sam. You're not really going to get him bigger pants are you? I didn't know you wore cologne. Can I get this? They're inside! I can't stay in here! What are they doing? Here! They're coming through the wall! Don't waste your bullets. Aren't the spiders in there? Ewww... what's that smell? What does that mean? Her breathing is shallow.       She's going into arrest. Am I... dead? I'm not in heaven? Then what's with all the gold? So were you. Have you got a smoke, kid? Bret! I blew up the kitchen. U.S.D.A. choice. Hurry! Oh shit. There's a ranch! Hurry! Let's get the fuck out of here!
