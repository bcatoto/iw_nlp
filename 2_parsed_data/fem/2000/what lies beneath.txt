Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy. No. But once I heard... A ghost? What do you mean? So much. Are you mad at me? I know he does. Yes it is. Can we please not do that? Please? Cause it is. I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing. Besides, Dad would have freaked. Mom, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right. I'm just saying, you're going to be fine. I'll come back all the time. It's only two hours away. Hey.Then we both are. What? Did you? I started seeing things. It got so bad your father almost had to put me away. I miss you. Listen to me. The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother. He loves you very much. He just-- That's not true. No, he wouldn't. Why? That was very good. Of course you will. I know that. Yes? Do you have a scarf? No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it. My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there. Let's deal with that. I'm willing to deal with that. I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist. That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me. Last year. I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this... ...a minor concussion. But the car looked bad. It could have been bad. I think it scared the hell out of Norman. Me? No. Well, in the accident I was injured, but... I felt...pain. That she'd been hurt by someone. This is great. I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my-- No. She said, "You know." That I know. I don't know, I'm very confused right now. Maybe. I don't know. I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive. Like somebody needed me. And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became. Isn't there something called group hysteria? Yes, but... What's happening to me? How? Are you humoring me? You think that'll help? What? What do you think I should do? Um...I'd rather not say...just yet. Pretty. She's a blond. I saw her in the water. Beside me. She was filling the bathtub. She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll. These are good. You're joking. Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and... Why is this so hard? No. Yes. I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace. Because he was worried about me. I didn't want to come. Mine. His. We both...thought... Who's that? Ohhh yes. No, no. Just a little, you know...We're fine. At the party. No. I'm just not sure what you mean. Uh-huh. What can be? I'm sorry? Almost. Just fine. It's a lovely party. I am. Give me that shit. Your wife. Oh-kay... When...when will she be back? Well maybe your wife... Right. Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood. I'm Claire Spencer. From next door. Um... No. No, I don't. Um...sure. What? Of what? What were you so afraid of? Thank you. Would you like some iced tea? And then you weren't there. You do? Wait! Don't go... I'm sorry. It's for the flowers. Why don't you... I know. And I'm sorry. I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school. That's not...It's not like that. Tell me. I can help you. Tell me. Please. What? What are you afraid of? Who? Your husband? Hello? Is everything alright? Um...yes. It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer. From next door. Is everything-- What was her major? Of course. I should be going anyway. You must have been very proud. I don't know. She never mentioned her father. I'm not. We...we met at a party. It's fine. Claire. No, I don't. I'd like to talk to you about Madison. Mrs. Frank? I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night... She's making this up. Do we have to? Stop. Oh God... We were suite mates. He was so pissed. I didn't sleep with him. He looked like one of the Monkees. We know each other. Wow. I don't know... I guess not. Jody he was lying. But he acted like he'd never heard of it. What is it? Like what? That could take days. I need to do something now. Don't you see? She wants us dead. I can't believe this is happening. Jody, she tried to kill him. No. She wanted me to know the truth. Now that I do...I think she's at peace. She could have hurt me if she wanted to. I don't know. How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself? No. All of us. Too late? Jody, it was an accident. Relieved? Why? Adamant? Oh God...you knew. I've got to find a bathroom. I'll call you. Please. No. Jody, listen to me. You have to listen to me. This is not something that I can do right now. Whatever it was, it's gone. I need it to be gone now. Hartford? Did I? Nothing. It wasn't anything. I've been on edge lately. Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just-- Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet. Jody, she's alive. It's alright. I think so Jody, wait. It's initials. F is Feur. It's her. Oh... Nothing's happening. I don't know. The planchette? Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee? Wow. I'm losing it. In the window. Norman's at work. Someone's there. Please. That's all I need. ...no...no...no... Jody, no... What? I don't know. When you say it, it sounds crazy. But what else could it all be? You got it. Absolutely. It's niiice. Oh my god. You bought it. Thanks, but I'm fine. You're discussing me with your psychic? Jody-- What is it? And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club. Okay, I'm a little tender. Why does everyone find that so surprising? Good. I'm good. MADISON! Mauduh... Mmmuh... I don't believe you. Don't I, Norman? YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE. Of a woman you killed! She's out there isn't she? She's in the lake. Fine. I'll do the shopping. You don't have to do that. Nothing. Maybe we can stop there for lunch. Do you know it? Little village down seven. Supposed to be charming. Adamant. Look for antiques... The leaves... I don't know, but I am. She was there and then she was gone. I felt it. She can't be here without me. She's gone. It's alright. Of course she did, Norman. What else could it be? She did it. How did she know where it was? Get out of my way. You should have tried harder. I'm not going to listen to this. Stop... Leave her out of this! Who? ...Oh BULLSHIT. You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family... What did you think I would do? Jesus Christ! I gave up my life and my music... DON'T touch me. Just get away from me. Go! So you fucked a student?! I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened. And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't. Until now. I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house. I was there. "You know..." Your wife... I think she's starting to suspect something. Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor. Since when? What's the matter? Wouldn't go that far. It's Madison Fra-- ...I'm positive this time... I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not... Yes. The ghost. It's her. This is the woman who I've seen. Not personally. What's wrong with me? But I don't remember. But why? I can't understand how I could just completely-- In the living room... I... When she said it, there was something familiar...but no. You told me that I was... I felt you...looking through me... Good. You sat in front...I saw you there... Are you glad? I'm glad. Yep. No, it's fine. I'm fine. Then where is she? Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm losing my mind... I will NOT. No! Not sweetheart, no. I believe in what's happening. I don't want to, but I do. I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you. Norman, this isn't about you. This is something that's happening to me. It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention. Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not... The accident...? Sabotage? What are you...? No. What? Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her. Jody and I. And she was there, Norman, she was. It scared Jody so bad she had to leave. We had a seance. Yes. And he's going to get away with it. He killed her. I'm not crazy. He killed her and-- No! And I don't need a psychiatrist! ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up. I never said I wasn't upset. Of course I'm upset. I miss her terribly. But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something... Norman... I don't need a shrink. Well, that's a relief. We're going to be fine. You're not at the center. Five minutes? What are you doing? Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just... ...Don't get all... Tonight? Oh. When? Dressed? She was lonely, I talked to her. Norman, I know how it looks, but-- Maybe. Point is...not me. I didn't do that. See? Okay. Okay. I'll bet there's...Look at this. Where is she then? It's her! I'm telling you. She whispered and turned on the music. She's trying to contact me! A flare? No. Look! In the window. No, no, no, no. The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay. It's not from here, believe me, I... All right, look at this. He did. She's in the picture. I went over to look and she's gone. The table was set for one. He killed her. Shhhh. Get down! He'll see. Huh. Did you call about the Feurs? Norman, you are so funny about that. No, I didn't. What? No. No. That's just mean. Oh. Jody wanted to know if I could get her some. I'm so sorry. That's... Oh, no... Well, that's nice. Wow. You're kidding. Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer... You are so brilliant. Really? I do, I do. I'm sure I'm just...how was your day? I don't know. Just...whispering. It was there. This angry music all by itself. And I heard whispering. No. Can you drive me home? I'll bring you back in the morning. In the house. I was scared. There were some noises. I didn't want to disturb you. Huh? Absolutely. Take your time. No, no. It's fine. Oh. Hi. Nothing. There was...I thought I saw something. Hurry... Norman, you have to look at this! Promise? I just wish you could have heard her. I know. I'd never be able to live with mysel-- But what if something happens? That's not what I'm sug-- To make sure she's all right. Not like this. We were never like this. I want to go over there. After dinner, we can-- I'm telling you. There was something in her voice... More or less. Of him I think. After that. Tomorrow. Mmm. Shhh. Yup. Nope. I know. We did. To get my life back. To have some time for myself. Some time for us. To tell you the truth...I'm excited. Not the focus. I am, really. Fine. If you have to work... Excellent. Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell. Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms. Three o'clock. Yep. It's Saturday. Don't. Norman Spencer. She's awake. What's their name? I think three...She got it. Turned it down. I'm not. Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks. And I kicked ass. My best stuff. Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried. We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open. You should have heard her play. And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish. I came in from my room... ...just so she could cut them off. Anyway, Claire slept with him... This is...Trust me, Claire. You hear something... change the subject. You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake. You know what happened. The rest is only details. And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those. If you want to put this back together...just let it go. You've got a beautiful life. And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you. I've come to think that's all that really matters. He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too. What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start? Did he say that? I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up... Alight, alright. Stay calm. You opened this door. There's got to be a way that you can close it. We need help. Please let me call the medium. I know. You don't know that. If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out. Somehow you have to break the connection. If she was dangerous before-- What are you going to do? I'm a terrible friend. I got there first. Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman. He seemed desperate not to lose you. He promised to handle it. And we all let it drop away. Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system? By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late. I had just been left by Richard. I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed. Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved. I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone. A blond. I only caught a glimpse. She was young. I should have said something right away. But I didn't. Artsy little village down seven. There's a guy there who sells my work. I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe. I was down in Adamant... Okay. Okay. But Claire-- And he's the real thing. Specializes in cases like this, like yours. Yes. Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford... Something was there. You saw it. Then what was it? What? Does Norman know? I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen. I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire... Are you okay? I have to go. Mef? What's Mef? M-E... Shhh. We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur. What's her first name? This. Place your fingers on the planchette. Sit down here. No, you're not. But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly. I don't... What? Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija. Telling you... Seance. Know what I think? You think he killed her? Listen, I've gotta run. I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning? Beautiful thing, alimony. Lose a husband, get a car. Think it'll help me pick up dudes? Yep. So you'll have some later. Notice anything...different? She's not a psychic. Just a very enlightened spirit. It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness. Sela suggested I bring-- Kambucha mushroom tea... Wow. Got here just in time. I brought you this. Well good. So you're human. Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping... You are? How you holding up?I'm sorry that I frightened you like that. But I was so touched by your concern. I've been lonely here. Perhaps we could be friends. You must think I'm pathetic. I couldn't catch my breath. That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked. I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there... I tried to leave him. Went to my mother's in Boston. He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home. Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe? That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave? Love. You're going to think I'm crazy or something. No. And these roses. They're much prettier up close. Your house is so beautiful. Very much. Right. I'm sorry. For scaring you like I did. When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day... I wanted to apologize. Oh God. He's back. I'm sorry. Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying. Please... This fence...it's so... I've never even met you. How? How can you help me? With your flowers and your perfect life... That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear. I can't, no, no, I can't... And I'm afraid. Oh god, I'm so afraid of... He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath... I'm not... I've seen you. From the window. You're the flower lady. Who are you?Biology. She wanted to be a doctor. Y'hear anything you'll let me know? They're calling me in to work. Full scholarships. Princeton too. She wanted to stay close. It's like that. Doesn't seem real. No note. Nothing. Cops say she'll be back. I just wanna know what happened. Why are you here? Well she wouldn't. He left when she was twelve. Never spoke about him after that. Sounds about right. Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's. Sure didn't get it from me. They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young. Maddie wouldn't hear about it. You look a little old for a student. Just plain old coffee. None of that mocha nonsense. She never mentioned you. What's your name? Please leave me alone. You know where she is? Yeah.The wives. Well, I'm glad. Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know. Toward the end. You remember? There was just...some tension. You were upset. I remember being concerned. For the Dupont Chair. I swear. I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst. Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year. I know how hard it can be sometimes. Wonderful. It's good to see you two doing so well. Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished. How're you holding up? Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity. Of course. You must be so proud.
