Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started. Where you goin'? You came for us.... What? What is it? Gonna lose everybody out here.... Lookit. Lookit! You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there? It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just.... Okay, it was me. What'd I do now? What ? Three full bottles. But almost time to refill. What're they doing? What're we -- I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything.... Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope? Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse? Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it? Leave the sled, let's go, go, go! Bring the light! No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner. Bottle-count. Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last. But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them. I would try for them. But they...they could still be.... Don't do this to me.... I can't....I can't.... No, you see, I promised them...I have to...I have to go and.... You're fuckin' with me. I know you are. Just come with me! I trusted you , Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race. What, you're afraid? I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do.. You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others. Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE! Riddick? How close? You sure you can keep -- We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers. Audrey? How many you see? Get out of our way. What about her? Think about what? Riddick? What the hell are you -- What do you see? Riddick? Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them? We can, can't we? Trust you? But I just wanted to say -- Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually -- Why, what'd you hear? You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now? Entered our minds. I got the quick-and-ugly version. They're coming. Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked. Heard about it. Just never seen it. You did this? To yourself? Show me your eyes. What whispers? Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before.... If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull. What, switch what? Let's move. Just a detour. He'll get us there. We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes. Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light. Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? If you got a receipt? How many bottles? ...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I think two more.... It hurts them. Light actually hurts them.... There.... Christ, you don't know what's out there! Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo. It's starting.... This is it? Booze? That's what you have to drink? We cannot go through there.... Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE! Just shut up, okay? This does not help us, Johns. Are you fucking high again? Just listen to -- I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship. Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking -- Riddick. Riddick . I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype? Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us. We're just burnin' light here. Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can't come up with a better plan. How much? How much you weigh, Johns? For your own fear. Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen. We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock. Stop it, stop it, STOP IT! You coulda helped. And you didn't. Anything else we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when -- You made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team. And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you born lucky? Never said you were a hype, either. You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like -- Dancin' on razor blades here... You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it -- You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over. Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns. You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal. Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I can use him to help with -- He can pilot? Get the fucking cells over here , Johns. What's the discussion? Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to -- ...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings -- 60 years ago. So what happened? Where are they, then? 15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch. Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells. Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts. Thanks for the tip, Johns. What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something? Nobody else is going down but me, okay? Thought you didn't believe his story. We're gonna find the body , Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it. Let's just be sure. So why isn't it all bloody? He used that? Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what.... Like what? No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt -- What? So now you know. During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin. Promise me. Swear to me you won't -- Better keep moving.... No, no, I wanted to get away. Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more. What? Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset. S'matter? I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous? We just keep him locked up forever? And him? Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but... Hey, me. Over here. Hey. Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad. Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler. Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink! Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know. It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to -- Owens! And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! That's how they train you! On a fucking simulator! Company's not here, is it? So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility? Can't get my nose down...too much load back there.... 1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin' took a swipe at us. You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too. He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when -- Oh, no. No, no, no.... And what about the cells? Do what I say. Please. Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them. Imam. Slow down. No, I'm not. But he can. They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them. Riddick? I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off. For now. Frightening thought. You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca? Some prophet guy? So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then.... I don't suppose....Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it. Take it. You were tryin' to kill him too. Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know. Not a star-jumper.
