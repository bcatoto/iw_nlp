Why do they always put braces on  teenage girls at the exact moment  when they're the most self-conscious  about their appearance? Tom -- Tom! Tom! Hi, Darryl. OK. Guess who's been asking for you? Hey, Terry. Where'd you get the hat? It's nice. Yeah, I had a very similar reaction  to it. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Um, yeah, but that would involve  speaking to him. Why do you have to stay so long? You seem to think my brother's a  bank! I know you're not. Don't you wanna tell me you love me? That was really convincing. Oh, yeah. You gonna call tonight? Oh no, they keep me fresh. Um -- Carol just called. She said  Terry and Rudy never showed up at  her house? Nice to meet you. Hi. Nice to meet you. Brian -- I gotta sit down. I'm fine...! Hello? Yes? Who should I say is calling? He says an old friend! Hello. You don't say. I'll just be in the kitchen. Get your fuckin' hands off him...! They just showed up! We never seen  them before... We have a right to protect ourselves.  What else do you need to know? I didn't. Yes.
