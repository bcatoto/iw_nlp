Go, fo' I change my mind. Just tell him to come over here and talk to me. Yo' cousin, Craig. Hook us up. Okay, I know what I want this time.Hey, how you get out of here. We must be here 'cause we stopped. Ezal! Ezal! Me neither. How far is Rancho Cucamonga? What? Keep pushing. William. Just do it. If you shut up I'll tell you. The urgent message is...Drop everything! Craig is in trouble. Come quick, don't call. Here's the plan. You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones. Get on! Get on. Rancho Cucamonga? What you say? Where did Craig move to?You alright? Next time, page me first. So what? Let's make'em wait. It's locked. Easier said than done. We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us. Thanks for noticing. It used ta be peaceful before they got out. Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown. You did all this for me? What?? So you snuck in my room to tell me that? What are you doing here? Better sooner than later. I just wanted to give you this. I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning. They're assholes. Hello, remember me? I don't know. My brothers won't give me a ride. To the Cucamonga shopping center. Karla. 'Take your car?' Are you going to take me to see Mom? Hey, what's going on? When? After you get all drunk and loaded? I thought you were taking me to see Mama?Why for? Them boys are real player haters. Peace out, Craig. See you later, Day-Day. Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you. Strange activity. I think they running drugs off Tijuana. Day-Day don't believe me. Well, then, it's all good. Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?

Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?Whatever you say, man. I didn't see shit. The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all. If you say another word, it's over. I'm not playing! I said shut up! Now who sent you? Shut up! Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass! What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
