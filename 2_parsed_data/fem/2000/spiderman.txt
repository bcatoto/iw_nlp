Hiya Peter... How'm I doing what? Peter? Flash...! Doctor Octavius! You are late for your lecture. The students are waiting. Doctor Octavius! You mean his anti-force theory... one day they'll give him the Nobel Prize for it. What is it, Peter? Professor Octavius!! But, your students... Well, do you mean nothing... or do you mean something but you won't tell me what it is? Well, I guess that's about as nothing as you can get... plain nothing. A beat. Ahh, it is something. Ock! Its dangerous... I can't. Help me! Peter! Help! Help me! Oh, why don't you grow up. I'm sorry... That sounds like a scenario for the end of the world. Look, it's just... I don't know... when you and Flash go after each other like that... He doesn't have to be. And besides, he's not all bad. Give it up, Parker. You'd die for a nickname like Flash. Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is my new roommate... Kim Nickson. We're going to the Student Reunion Meeting. You coming? It's not what you said, it's how you say it, ShooShoo! That's the understatement of the year. I was just so desperately bored... I thought I'd come over and make you dinner... But I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches. Oh. And those foul chemicals in the pots... Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills... Yes. Do you have a date? Then come on. Someone tried to rob me of some paper... I suspect they were looking for that one. Award winning stuff. Peter Parker's data on the Planetary Conjunction. Damn lucky I hid it in my computer under another title. Thorkel, be careful when you talk to Octavius. Remember... the man is a very fragile genius. One day he'll bring us all the Noble Prize. That's him again. He's working day and night. Please, Otto, we must lock it up. Oh... well Thorkel... few more hours won't make a difference. It's on the table! Turn off the TV! How's that girl you told us about, Peter? A boy your age should have a girlfriend. Peter, any girl that's worth your attention is of course gonna have a boyfriend... But if she really gets to know what you have to offer she'll... you get my drift? Oh, Peter, you promised you'd spend the night... Peter, what you should be finding... is a nice girlfriend. Could anyone be in there, Peter? Where is he going? Take it easy. Take it easy with him. What was what? What hit you? You're going to be fine, Otto. Peter? What time is it? Are you alright? Does this have to do with a certain girl we talked about at dinner? You were what? Oh! I get it, you mean a love bug. Peter, did you at least talk to her? She bit you? Oh, you did it in the bathroom? Peter, this is craziness, why don't you use your bed? You're up all night. You're in the radioactive labs. You never take time to eat or sleep. Am I right? Did you eat something today? Okay, Peter go back to bed, and remember we love you. It is so freaky... Yes... Yes, of course. Everything's online. You have a visitor, Doctor... And now, a new challenger, for the thousand dollar fight, weighing in at one hundred and fifty pounds... from parts unknown! Here is the Amazing... Mysterious... Incredible Superman... ...Spider-Man!!!!! Will you two shush. I'm trying to work. Yeah... he's some clown we saw on TV last night... boy does Flash think he's hot. Hey, we better rush... visiting hours will be over soon. Doctor Octavius? You have visitors. Doctor Octavius? My God, what happened? I'd better call the doctor! ... howdy partners. Nothing beyond what I read in the papers. I'm afraid he's not the same man we knew. You know, I've been digging through the notes on his experiments... You boys must have had an extraordinary classroom experience. Whenever you're ready... I'll look at it. I know it's going to be an important work... and Peter, take my hat. It is a costume party. Hiya, Peter. Who is in the Spider-Man costume? How did you recognize him? I wanna dance... Hey, Spider-Man... Shall we Flash dance? I'm not... Hey, Peter! These are your pictures! It says here "Photos by Peter Parker." Thank you, thank you. We have a special surprise guest tonight. The Empire State University Masquerade Ball presents... The "Slammy" winning star of MTV'S wrestling tournament... The Amazing Spider-Man! Come on... Flash... Who are you...? You sound very familiar. What's that? Ben gets through everything. He'll be alright. The doctors are... How's my... how's my husband doing...? She's alright. She just fainted. We'll have to check her for symptoms of shock. If you want to wait, you can get some coffee on the third floor. Hey, Peter! Are you finished with my computer yet? I got a paper too, you know... What were you doing in here? Flash didn't come. Taxi... I guess. You must spend a lot of time with this Spider-Man guy... Peter! Don't you think you ought to unplug that! Peter...? Doctor Octavius...! You're... You're... You're so weird!... with those... what do you call those... Peter?... oh... he's not here. He's gone. I don't think he'll be back for awhile. Of course not. Why would I lie about a thing like that? Really. He's... out. What are you doing... let me go! Please... take those things out of my hair! Whatever you call them... please... Oh, I don't know. Maybe. He's very inexperienced. Thank you... Shocking...? I would! Peter...! Peter! Help! Peter! Spider-Man... Put me down, you mechanical mutant! You jerk! Tell your friend Peter next time I'll get the taxi myself... Great... What do you think you're doing? Thanks but nooooooooooo! Wait a minute. Where are you taking me? SPIDEY hounded by the Police, rejected by the girl. Where are we? If you're trying to impress me Spidey, I want you to know I'm not easy. Okay, I'm impressed... now put me down, Spidey... put me down. Wow... look, this is our dormitory. I can get to my room. Hey, wait a minute... there's Flash, if I'm not mistaken. You know my name? Okay, put me down and we can talk, alright? All I know is you're the Amazing Spider-Man... or better you're Spidey the good guy on the block... you're a weirdo in a clown spider suit. Which one? Well, Flash is not exactly my boyfriend... There's someone I like, but he's too shy to notice. You know everybody... Flash we have to call Peter! How'd you know this was Flash's place? Peter told you all about Flash? Peter told your Hero all about me... Peter...! No. What a night, huh? It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets to Les Miserables... wanna go? Hey, Peter... how did you know about last night...? My exciting ride with Spider-Man... Peter! Plutonium... What's going on? Oh my God! Henry!!! What are you doing here? Get out of here! Get out of here! It's Spider-Man! Hey, what are you talking about?! Is that the real Spider-Man? This is Doctor Otto Octavius' work. I must get back to my university. I must stop Ock... he's gone crazy. Can you help me? Spider-Man! Listen to me! If he can do this with the train, if he's come this far, then I can pretty well predict his next step. He'll go to Plutonium SL 270 for the power. He must be stopped... or else he'll destroy our world. Wait Spider-Man. I don't think I can make it... You mustn't waste time saving me... you must save the world! You must go and stop Ock! He is looking for Plutonium SL 270 I'm sure... There's only one place he can get the Plutonium SL 270... Toxic... toxic dump... any toxic dump would have SL 270. You're as lovely as Peter said you were. Thank you. He really wanted so badly to come see you. He called me up out of the blue. Tell me about Peter. What's he been up to? He seems so preoccupied. Oh, you know Peter... he's all caught up in some kind of study he's doing. Things are really crazy at the university now. Things are crazy... everywhere. I guess Peter's just... well, you know... pulled into his shell. When Peter was little, he loved to hide. In the closets. Under the sink. He always needed a secret place. But when I'd look for him, he'd always laugh... he wanted to be found. Yeah... well. I don't think he wants me to find him... Well, I'd better be going. My friend Flash is picking me up. This Flash... he isn't your boyfriend, is he? No... not really... I think you can guess why... Elizabeth...? She turns. Finders keepers, losers weepers. What? That's what I used to say to Peter when I found him. Alright! Freeze! Up against the wall and spread 'em Don't you recognize him... it's Ock! Leave him alone!!! Leave them alone Otto! Otto... I was wrong. I've gone over your research. It's brilliant, Otto. It's mad, but it's brilliant. You have much work left to do. I want to help you, Otto. For the sake of science, go and do your experiment. Leave... these kids alone and I'll help you. Do as he says. Don't lose your energy screaming. Catch this rope and climb up, come on! I've been through the Octavius data. He has enough power with his Plutonium. Especially if he gets his hands on Parker's data, there he has enough power to do what he wants to do. And we are not going to stop him in time before the Planetary Conjunction occurs tonight... What do we do now? Wait... I think I can release my right hand... Harry! Get over here! I bet he is with Spider-Man... Look at the moon... I have never seen it so big. Our campus... right there... see those beams from Ock's lab. We're late... it's coming... the Conjunction will happen in a few seconds. Where...? What...? Damn the calculations! My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to... all the patterns, all the harmonies... everything will be destroyed. It is cosmic suicide! You have no right! You have to stop him... Spider-Man you have to stop him. He's in there. I know Peter is in there. She breaks into a run. Spider-Man! The Conjunction! It's happening! Peter! Peter, where are you?! Peter! Where is it going Otto? Then... why? Yes, but not on account of our world. We have only one world... only one life. The floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a hole on a pond. BANG! BANG! SPIDEY comes to just as the section of floor beneath himself and ROZ gives way and falls through. Spider-Man! Only you can save us now... Peter! Peter! Where's Peter? He must be here somewhere. This building is flying. I'm in a goddamn flying building... Oh my God... What is happening? I can't... hold on! Don't do it, Dr. Octavius! But what about Peter? We've got to find Peter! Go where? It's breaking apart! We have to go back. Forget it... What am I supposed to do with this! The door is stuck. I knew you were going to say that. Where's the way out? Is this going to work? I just adore confidence in a man. What is it you say when you jump? We have a lot to thank your friend Spider-Man for. Peter...! Finders, keepers... I think I'm in love. With your friend... I am... you think we'll see him again? Oh. This may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know?
