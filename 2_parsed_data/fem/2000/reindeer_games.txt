Good. Radio said negative five. Yeah. Radio said. I figured you walked outta there and  saw me and walked right the other  way -- Saw my outfit or something, my coat -- Saw me -- You are to me. Thought you wrote you had a mustache. No, no, no. Be like you want to be. What. No -- No, c'mon -- You're better than the picture in my  mind, Nick... You're real. Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that  supposed to mean -- Well. You're not the first guy I  wrote to. But you're the only one I  kept writing to. I told you, Nick. Remember? All the guys I've ever been with...  they never want to know me. Who I am  on the inside. They just want to qet  inside. When they do, they think  that means they know who I am. That  I trust them. That they know me.  That there's nothing left to learn. A guy like you, Nick -- six months  before you can even touch my face. I  figure a guy in that kind of bind,  he's gonna hafta work to get to know  me some other way. Not bad. Just regular. You wrote me wonderful things, Nick.   Personal things. Yes it was all you -- I'm talking about the heart, Nick.  I'm not talking about the words. Then he shoulda signed his name. And he'd be here right now. Provisions! We are not leaving that  motel room again till after New  Year's: we need ten days worth of  provisions! What's good?! Oh my, we've got a special on our  chocolate crunchie elves, they're  shaped like little helpers -- THIS MAN... has not had a cookie in  two goddamn years! Get him two of  everything! Can't survive on our bodies alone,  Nick. Hurry up! Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby. So don't talk to me about little  white lies. You need a COAT! No boyfriend of mine is going to  walk around in negative-five degree  wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat! You got out, Nick. You're here.   You're my Christmas. You forget where I work? Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho  ho ho. Toys for adults. Where are your toys  for adults? C'mon. How old are you, sixteen?  C'mon. I got fifty dollars to spend in your  store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you  help me or not? Thank you. You know what I was thinking, after  our holiday hideaway? Instead of  going back to Detroit, maybe we could  go gambling. Y'know? Drive up to  that Indian place you worked at.  Wouldn't that be fun? I haven't gone  gambling in forever! Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good  at. I mean, they'd give us some free  games or something, wouldn't they?  Since you worked there? And the slots, slots I'm good at  too. Wouldn't that be fun? We could live it up and -- I just... I thought you'd have friends  there... Well, they don't know what the hell  they're missing. Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to  disturb us for the rest of the year.  I get back in that room, you better  be wearing nothing but a candy cane. No, lover. I'll see what you can do. Watch out, baby! I'm bringing in the  fucking tree! I'm telling you, we got the best one  in the store... I don't know why  people want their houses smelling  like the stupid woods... NICK! Gabriel -- ! Gabriel, what are you doing! GABRIEL!!! Gabriel, let him go -- What are you doing here?! Gabriel! GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM! Nick... Don't hurt him... Please, Gabriel, don't... YES!!! Shh, Nick, shh. They won't hurt you  now. You're okay... I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't  hurt you anymore. He's not a bad person, Nick... he's  not... You're not gonna hurt him anymore! Since Janey moved in... Gabriel...  he's come over more and more. To the  apartment. Janey's the divorced one,  'member, with the tit job -- He read the letters, Nick. Some day  I wasn't there. He went through my  room. He found your letters. He knows you worked in that casino. Nick, no -- Nick -- Nick, what are you -- Nick, I love you -- Nick, it won't work. It won't work! He'll kill you. My brother's killed people, I know  he has. Truckers. If you talk him  into thinking you're not you, you'll  only get yourself dead. Nick, please, it's me -- No, Nick, no -- I love you! If you say that, if you keep saying  that, they will kill you. If they  think you're not you, they will kill  you. Don't you see? I know what you're  doing, but it won't work! I won't let him hurt you! He just  wants what you know! Just tell him what you know, Nick!  That's all they want! And we'll get  out of this! He found them... I swear, Nick... ...he found them... Nick... Gabriel, you promised! You promised me! NO! NICK!!! NICK!!! NOOOOO!!! I love you... Nick, I love you... Gabriel! Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's  all you ever said... Jack. Jack Bangs. He said he wanted to talk to you.   When he found the letters... he said  "when your boyfriend gets out, I  wanna talk to him." I thought he  meant back in Detroit. I thought he  meant -- I thought we'd have a few more days. No! Nick! He wants to know how to rob  it, and he'll leave you alone! That's  all he wants! I hate him, Nick... you know how... Not without you. They run routes mostly east, retail  stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows  some guys in New York, Miami, guys  he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides  'em with his regular loads. No. He wants to be working for himself  someday. What? I don't think they've ever robbed  anything before. I think they've  just driven guns. They're truck drivers. We're gonna get out of here, Nick.   We're gonna get out of this... Nick... If I'd told you what he wanted, you'd  have been gone. You'd have gotten on  that bus and stayed on it. And if  that's selfish, I am. If that's lying,  I'm a liar. But I been dealing with  fucked-up brother and his fucked-up  friends for a long time, and I was  stronger than him then and I'm  stronger than him now. 'Cause he  showed up for money. I showed up for  love. And if you're so ready to make me  your enemy... then what did you show  up for, Nick. What did you really  want... with me... Get your goddamn hands off me -- So does it look a lot different? That guy knows you? Be careful, Nick... Hey Nick! We're up fifty cents! Nick, what happened -- He started losing his hair. Nick! Run! RUN!!! No!!! RUN!!! Nick, the ice is -- Nick! Jesus, Nick -- Nick, oh my God, what'd he do to  you? What'd he do? Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move,  stay right here -- We'll get there, baby... we'll get  there... Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick.  You haven't had cranberry buns in  two years. You saved my life. You could have run, but you didn't.  You saved me. I saved you because I love you, Nick. Why'd you save me? I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry... I love you, Nick... I love you... What? I don't know... Nick, what are you talking about? Part of... with them? Yeah. What're you gonna do about it. What's the matter, Gabriel? This is  what you wanted him for, isn't it? He wants to see your map. He says he wants it now. How are we gonna do this, Nick? Bullets or no bullets, he won't do  it. No. They all are. Football's on. ...and he's saying "We're not gonna  help him just to walk away. If we're  gonna help him... we're gonna get it  all... ...he wants to help now, he wants to  rob it now we could probably stay  right here, he'd go on and rob it by  himself -- No, baby. He wants me. He wants... your "sister"... Nick Mason's gonna help us more than  we ever dreamed. To all those cons... We musta written what, twenty of  'em? And they were before this guy.   One, two letters apiece, ten to the  racetrack guy in Leavenworth -- -- plus the forty to Mason... how  many letters is that? One more day, baby. One more day to  Christmas. Didn't have to hit me so fucking  hard. Didn't have to throw me outta  the goddamn truck. What, he should see me help you catch  him? He's shown us the setup, he's drawn  us the map, he's helped us do the  plan. He wants a gun, give him a  gun. Take the bullets out, whatever,  but give him the gun. The more  manpower we've got in there, the  better. He won't try and make his  move till the money's in hand. Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be  the tinsel round your tree... Merry Christmas-Eve, my love. My  love, my love. Merry Christmas-Eve... Gabriel! Where should we go, Nick? When we're  gone from here... where should we  go... We go together, Nick. Wherever... we  go together. Remember? Three minutes. Go. MOVE, MOVE, MOVE! You... you... YOU -- Your turn. You shouldn't have. Who wouldn't. Merry Christmas, Rudy. Merry Christmas. What? What are you talking about? I... you told me your name was Rudy.  You told me a million times, back in  the truck, telling me you weren't  Nick -- You were screaming you weren't Nick!  And we just didn't fucking believe  you! You said it a million times! Men. I missed you too, Nicky baby. For your information. I never fuck  the wrong guy. NOOOOOOO!!! Rudy...? Rudy?
