Thanks. Wilton Estate. At me friend's house. No. Yeah. Yes. Working at Woolworths. I left last year. They said he was drunk. Yeah.You coming back? What you going to do? And that'll make me feel better? Not much. What, and get myself beaten up again? No. Are you tired? Did you sleep well? Uh-huh. Do you want breakfast? Are you awake? What's that supposed to mean? How'd you know I wouldn't? What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody? You're a bastard. What you going to do? What about Keith? Thorpey nearly died laughing. And what about you? Did you kill Brumby? They bloody hurt me. What'll they do to him? No. You sod. Now just a minute... Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it. Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know. I'll call the police. And what you going to do? Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort? Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy. And who's he? You don't look it. What the bloody hell do you think you're at? It'll cost you. Is he staying the night? What is it? Ta. Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday. Will this do? Are you a traveller? It never is. Her husband docks tomorrow, does he? I see.No. The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know. Your brother? What you talking about? Expect so. Yeah. Yeah. Shouldn't think so. I don't know. What girl? You've been watching the film. You sure about that? That's why you waited for me. Especially when I play the lead. Now you're asking. Entertaining. He won't. He thinks I'm simple. Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant. Brumby. We're there now. Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come. Nasty. You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited. To the demon king's castle, of course. A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky? You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you? Could you please put my glass on the table? Could you do me a favour? He was here for four days. Yes, while he was here. We went about together. He came to see Mr Kinnear. Oh yes. When he came up on business. Yes. I met him last year. Yes. Sid Fletcher. I know him too. Do you? You know Sid Fletcher? You know Sid Fletcher?I don't know nothing. It is. Honestly. It's the truth. He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both! He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street, I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday. He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do. Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not. Why all the bloody needle? He was gentlemanly. I like that. Once a week? Yes. I can't help the way I am. Yes. Nicer than most. He was all right to me. I can't. I must go. I'm in a hurry. Killed? I don't know anything about it. No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know. She's nothing to do with me. What about? Everyhing go off all right?
