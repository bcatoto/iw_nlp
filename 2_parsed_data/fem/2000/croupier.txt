I couldn't resist them. No, no. I'm not ready for you.  There's some vodka in the freezer. I won't be that long. It's not just inner beauty, is it? Where did you get it? You shouldn't have done that. I  know what it meant to you. Take it back. Till you sell your  book. Of course they will. You just have  to be patient. I'm betting on you. You are to me. Come into my world. You're my prisoner. I want to hear it. What job? How did you land that? 450? What did you do, just walked  in and said I want to be a croupier?  Don't you need training? You were a croupier there? You  never told me that. I thought you  just knew some gamblers. 450 a week. I've never earned that  in my life. You're an enigma, you  are. A fucking enigma. You sold the car. You got a job.  What's the third thing? Tell me. I love you Jack, you know that. You've got such beautiful hands. I'm Bella. Hi, Jack. Welcome to the cesspit. How do I look? The punters love it. Tits in  uniform. Tens, please. Perhaps this man will bring us  luck. What's that aftershave you're  wearing? Good evening, Mr Tchai. What's the time? How did it go? You're shaking. What is it? Poor baby.  This'll relax you. I loved it blond. When you get home, I'm asleep.  When I leave home, you're asleep. You don't gamble, but do you smoke? How about now? Where've you been? I've got to  give evidence in court at nine. Take that back! Fucking take that back. I'm not a  cop any more. Are you drunk? This fucking job's getting to you.  You haven't written a fucking word  since you started. Well, that's my poor upbringing. I  didn't go to no private school. I  haven't got no class. I want to  live with a writer. Not a fucking  croupier. I don't even know what  the word means. Croupier. What do I mean to you? I want to  know. Tell me. Haven't you got a conscience of  your own? What are you doing here? You know the rules. I don't finish till eight. Make it  nine and you're on. Well, that's our life now, isn't  it? Animal! Then go back home. To the zoo! Yuck. Jack. Do you need a ride? My car's in the garage. I'll take you up on that. Jack! Jack. Leave him! Come on! Let's go. We don't want the cops  here. You're shaking. Excuse the mess. Careful. Don't tear anything. It's funny, isn't it? If that guy  hadn't come up to you, you wouldn't  be here now. All men are cheats. I spent two years on the game. I  don't mind telling you that. But don't worry, I'm clean as a  whistle. I only did S & M. No blow jobs. No screwing. I got scared. Can you? I'm happy being a dealer.  At least the punters keep their  hands to themselves. Well it is. But I know where I am. I've been watching you work. You're  the best in the place. But you  know that. Ah, we all say that. But if we  hate it, why do we do it? What do you really want to do? Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm  sorry. It's none of my business.   It's just that you're not like the  others. Now he's a real shit. Don't get  friendly with him. I'm sure he's  got his hand in the till. You know  what he said to me once? "I want  to fuck the whole world over. That's  my mission." The shit! Sorry. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. You had a  wonderful character before, the  Gambler. He was so romantic. Is that your idea of a winner? He  doesn't give a shit about anyone.  He uses people and -- I don't give a fuck about the sex.  Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's  just a miserable zombie. Is that  the way you feel now? Is that what's  happened to you? Oh really. Then why is he called  Jake. Why don't you come clean and  call him Jack. There's no hope in it. Without hope there's no point to  anything. Crap. It's not relative. It's  unfair. Like your casino. It's  designed unfair. And your croupier's  a little shit because he goes along  with it. The door, Jack. No. Answer it! You fucking little shit! You shopped  me. Reynolds got a doctor in. They  forced me to take a dope test. It  was positive. As you knew. Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked  my dope, then shopped me. What do  you think of that? I can't get a  job now. You bastard. You're no different  from Matt. A pair of vicious little  shits, that's what you are. You're all scumbags. I agree. Go on. Go after her! Where's our drinks? They're so bloody selfish. Do that again. That's sexy. Don't they look pretty. You're not supposed to talk, Giles. He's probably lying. He does that. No! No stripping. Right. We're not having that again! Although... Two cards. Oh I don't know...Er...two cards. That's it. I haven't got any more  cash. Ha. Ha. Ha. Not so fast, darling. Wow. What are the odds for this  happening? Thousands to one. I hope it brings you luck. -- I don't care about her. Of  course, I was angry. But not with  you. The book is yours not mine. I  was wrong, what I said about it. I  hurt you, didn't I? It's none of my business what you  write. And your job, that's none  of my business either. I love you.  And I've done everything wrong. You will? Then you can dye your hair blond  again. You were talking in your sleep. Bring me some luck. Aren't you ever tempted to gamble? I can just imagine, being around  so much money all the time... Really? I must be a fool. I never think  about the odds. There you go. I thought you wouldn't want to  spend Christmas Day alone in here. Happy Christmas. Now...noodles or rice? I don't want a criminal for a  boyfriend. It's probably easier for you to  eat the rice. Nothing about you. Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or  I'll shop you. All you have to do  is keep your word. It's that simple. Here...use a spoon. You're already alone. Why did you take the money? What? How can anyone be that naive? You've been avoiding me. I'm Lucy. I'm a witch. A white witch. Why  don't we move on? I might. Too much. Eighteen hundred. Where to? Hey! I saw her! You don't trust women drivers, do  you? What are you laughing at? Who was  that on the phone? Fools.
