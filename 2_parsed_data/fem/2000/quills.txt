I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think. Then what's he doing here? I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth. You've been to his quarters, haven't you? We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo? I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound! Was ever a man more risqu�? He wants to take me every way! Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou�! Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow! And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind! I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!" My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal! Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows! At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy? Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy. Yes? Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible! Well. Go on. Come now, darling, give it a read. If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories -- He's a writer, not a madman. Once or twice. No one's forcing you to listen. "And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --" Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching. You'll hate me now, won't you? What? What've I done? Why not? Mother's not half so blind as you. It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here... Don't turn us out, Abbe. I've you to look after me, haven't I? I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name -- He's not the man who's cast a shadow here. If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life. I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess. Ow! It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest. Don't say that; reading's my salvation. I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink -- His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all. Yes, Abbe? Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil? You asked my name once; it's Madeleine. I'll be waiting. I'll pass the word on, then. Here it is; the last chapter. It's because of the Marquis, isn't it? I'm only a laundress; not a detective. "Well worth the dig!" "The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..." "A habitu� of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years." It's not your cup of tea, Mama. ...yes, I've got that bit... A tale more horrible than all the rest combined! -- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper! Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval -- Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both! You could whisper it through the walls of your cell. It needn't be; not if you've another story. He's a man of God; he's true to his vows. The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you -- I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations. It's only been described to me. In your books. They've taken your clothes? I don't believe it! What have they done to you now? What's that then? You demand a lot from your readers, you do. It's a long story, this one. Oh, you. You talk same as you write. Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them? Is it terribly erotic? Is it awfully violent? Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript. There's something else I want from you. I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis. I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours. You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind? Don't start --And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose. Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own. Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows. Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet -- If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails -- I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you? Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him. Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick? I am eternally in your debt. Don't toy with me, Doctor. It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag... Oh, but I am! What thought is that? It's tainted money, Doctor. I am not a wealthy woman. I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should. Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms. You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case. I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane. Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy. He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name -- Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again! Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins? You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt. To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage? I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself. How was I to know, my darling? Forgive me, I beg you -- ....shame on you, truly...
