In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away. No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise... I don't know. I found him lying there. It's not. I can't take it. I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back. I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is... My father. So you're going to kill him? I don't want to see! Yes I do, I really do. It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead. ... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said. When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right? But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you... Yeah, I know. No! Why are you haunting me? My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life. You killed Lauren! You killed her! I know who you are. That's why you paint your face. To hide. You killed that cop Dutton. Daisy. How did you know? Stay away from me! Dad! Dad! How do you know? You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him. And he's right over there by the way. What did you do to your face? Yeah, no kidding. I know her friends. I'm never going back in that house again. Get away. I don't believe you. Don't call me that! Don't call me anything! About you. Stay away from me! Stay away! You killed her! You're in with them. I think I dropped an earring. He said he'd prove it. That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren. Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us. The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car. What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was! This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face. Watch out! It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time. Stay in the car. I'll only take a second. I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it. Why are there so many?I do. Every day. She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?! You killed my daughter. You mean Alex. Please. Come inside. I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me. Sweetheart... About them. You've got to leave it alone. They killed her because she found out. Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen. No. It's not what you think. Looks like you have them both on. It still doesn't mean... Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message. What? What is it? What is it? Are you ok? What were you yelling about? Erin! Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you. Honey. I just can't. Just hold on to me.Look, can I just call a cab? You want me to walk a straight line? Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her. Not tonight. Honest. She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before. Anything wrong?
