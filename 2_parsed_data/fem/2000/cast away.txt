Keep painting. Promise me. Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch. Do you...have any more packages to deliver? You are. Yes you are. What gave you the idea to paint on that cave? I can't believe this. I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist. You're into something very powerful. Primal. Truly. He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him. Oh? You've tried? Yeah. A long time ago. Hmmm. Feels like it might have gotten wet. Want to come in? Get dry for a minute. You know what happened to this? Well, I have to say, I'm impressed. You never gave up. You came on a bicycle? No wonder it's so late.I've got lots of time. Must be a story there. You? Personally? What brings you out to the sticks? Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?I'm so glad you're alive. I love you, Chuck. I had to come. To be sure you were okay. I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals. What will you do? You okay? This is so unfair. You hated being alone. Couldn't stand it. Busy every minute. Always plugged into something. So simple to say, so hard to do. Come on. Try. Don't overwhelm me with the details. You know how I hate that. Yeah? Maybe now's when you tell me about it. Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted. Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing. What's that, written on the sail? All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me. What's that? No, this is Jack. Jango was hit by a UPS truck. Can you believe it? Her name's Hannah. I didn't want to. It just happened. One day Gary was there. He took care of everything. He took care of me. I was a mess. If I'd known you were alive -- I would never -- I got married. Right back, you said you'd be right back. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Go on. We'll be fine. I'll feed Jango to the frogs. Chuck, you're breaking my heart. Get back? From where? Don't even start. What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad? Don't tell me you're mad. Be mad. Be who you are right now. Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was. I burned the Christmas tree. I'm sorry about the presents. I got a little carried away. There isn't any us. That's your dog. No. "We're" not over-reacting. This isn't working out. You want to. You can't go now. A ring. I wanted a ring. For when I travel? A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish. He's your cute thing. I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of -- Let me guess, Russia came up? You don't seem too happy about it. Merry Christmas eve. Yeah, tell me. Tell me all of it. Chuck. Chuck, forget the Xerox. So Russia didn't turn out well? Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that. Did you get it fixed? How was Russia? My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed. Your eyes are puffy. Did you take Valium again? Sonofabitch!There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney. The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow. And how was your Christmas?What a journey you've had. It seems more than a person should have to bear. This is my home. I'm part of the wallpaper. Roger got me on. I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back. I would have come to Memphis, but -- There's settled folks, and there's nomads. You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here. I'm doing fine. Don't you even think about it. Oh no, the prodigal son's home. We bring out the store bought. That new roof, that's your doing. It seemed like she had such a good time last time. What happened to your pants?
