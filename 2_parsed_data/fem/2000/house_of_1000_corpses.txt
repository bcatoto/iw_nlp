Once I had a cat, he was the sweetest  little guy. Then one day he got sick  and died. My heart was broken. My  whole body hurt. After that, I saw things differently,  everything could be summed up with  three simple words... fuck the world. Huh? Come on sleeping beauty, time to go  to work. Sleeping. Rise and shine. No please, let me sit this one out. Let's go. You're the one who wanted  to be a photographer. I resign. Too late. You're in for life, let's  move it out Private Shutterbug. Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy  folk art. It's so quaint... it's so  primal... it's so crap. Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute. ...and really who are we to judge  the artistic merit of the tin-can  Mona Lisa? Aw, shit... I gotta pee anyway. I swear I've aged five years since  this trip started. Tell me about it. God, I hate falling asleep in the  afternoon. Now I'll be up all night... ...ugh, my back is killing me. Yeah, hey how far do you think we  are from your Dad's? I don't know. Couple hours I think.  I've got to call him. It will be nice to have a few days  off to regenerate. This trip is fun,  but it's starting to get brutal. Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at  that old stripper lady's place.  Watching her dance around with those  ratty-looking animals was ridiculous. I know, that was some crazy shit. I  never in a million years would have  believed it if I hadn't seen it. A decent meal every once in a while  wouldn't hurt either, this road food  is crap. If I never eat at another Waffle  House again, I can die a happy girl. Scattered, smothered and covered. Exactly... well, I guess a couple  more photos won't kill me. Tickets for what? I don't want to see that. How about if we skip it and just  hang out here. I can get some great  shots of this stuff. Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds  fun. Alright, alright. I know... I wanted  to be the photographer. No, nothing like that... yeah, we're  gonna be a little late. We stopped  for gas at this place called Capt.  Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville  and it turned into a whole thing, so  we're kind of behind schedule. Yeah, well he's still here. I think  him and Jerry are fast becoming  buddies, you know Jerry... yeah,  he's gotta see everything... yeah, I  know... thinks there's some unsolved  mystery around every corner. Hopefully I can move things along  here and make up the lost time by  speeding all the way home... yes,  Dad I'm kidding. Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all  we're gonna get out of this place  and its starting to rain. Yeah so... OK, expect us more around  eleven or so. OK yeah, I will...  love you, too, bye. Geez, he never gets tired does he. Never. I swear to God he never sleeps,  he goes to bed after me, wakes up  before me. He's always working on Maybe he's a cyborg. Here he comes. Huh? Ugh, what's that smell? That's true. He performed lurid acts  upon me and my person while my husband  Russell was a fix'n to our hound  Clarence. It looked just like that chubby fella  from McHale's Navy... Ernie Borgnine. Let's just skip it. It is probably  nothing anyway. Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see  anything now, it's too dark. Let's  forget it. Well, don't even think about playing  the good samaritan, there's way too  many psychos wandering loose these  days. That seems likely. Should we stop? She looks like a freak. Stick her in the front, if you want  to pick her up so bad. She's soaked. She looks like she stinks. Hardy har, har. Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been  standing out there in that toad  strangling rain for like a hundred  million years. Yeah, most people just whiz on by  like I was invisible or something...  or else they're creeps who wanna jam  their slimy hands down my pants and  twiddle my naughty-naughty. Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I  look in and he's got his thing out  waving it around like a drunk monkey. Well, hitchhiking ain't the safest  way for a girl to travel. Yeah, but it's fun. Sounds like a magical trip through  the heartland. Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's  house... yeah, I was out doing this  thing. Couple more miles up this road. Yeah, I know where that is, it's  right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's  tree. I can show ya. Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play  there all the time. But, you can't  find it without me. Outsider can't  find no deadwood. Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know  what word I hate? Cone. Any cone, yeah... I hate that word... sounds ugly, I  don't like crumple either. I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes  make me nervous. Oh yeah, the tree. This is crazy. She don't know nothing. Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's  at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute  all bundled up like a cinnamon roll  of Christmas love. Go straight up about another mile...  til we hit Cherrypicker Road and  turn right... it ain't far from there. Excuse me, could you not smoke in  here? Why are we stopping? Honk at him. Scare him. Go around him. Then run him over, he'll move. No! He's one of God's creatures, he  can't help it if he's dumb... I'm  just crazy about animals. The animals have got nothing to do  with it. Let's get going before that thing  tries to eat the car or something. I'd like to see that. Nice. Things like that get a lot bloodier  than ya think. Don't even say it. You got to be fucking joking. God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt  was fucking bullshit. Can I help you with something? I was just wondering. Wondering what? Are you two gals all funny with each  other? What? You know... a couple of queers. Do you believe this fucking girl? I was just wondering, cause you got  a pissy look about you... like a  real pussy licking bitch. No. No pussy licking here, but thanks  for your concern. What? For fucking sake Jerry, what the  fuck are we gonna do? What the hell are you laughing about? I just pictured the tire sitting in  a chair watching TV. Oh, wonderful. Fucking psycho. If you keep going straight you can  get back on the interstate... it's  easier. Just back up. Oh wait! I love this song! What! Turn that fucking radio off! Now what are we gonna do? We can walk to my house from here.  My brother's got a tow truck, he can  come get your car. I think I'm going fucking crazy. I can't believe... OK. You said it, not me. Screw that, no way, I ain't letting  you go by yourself. Yeah, it won't take long and besides  you sassy poodle girls will slow us  down. Come on. Hi, I'm Miss Bunny and welcome to my  Hollywood Revue... ...where the stars shine forever. Hi, this is the place where the magic  happens. This is Jenny, she is our resident  Ingrid Bergman. This is Ronald J. Perrywinckle...  our Humphrey Bogart... today we'll  be doing a scene from Casablanca. But what about us? When I said I would never leave you. Almost there... are you in a hurry  or something? Fuck, it's freezing. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so how does that fit with the  story of four morons with a flat  tire looking for a dead tree? So. Why? Yeah? So what? You know what Jerry, who really cares  at this point? God damn it, I must be fucking crazy  to let him go off with that crazy  fucking bitch. That stupid hillbilly slut. You didn't see the look she threw  me. She's up to something. Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty  fucked shit to us. When you were outside with Bill. She said we look like pussy lickers  or some shit like that. Yeah, she said we looked queer. These are all my dolls. I use to  like to chop their heads off. The door's locked. I'll gotta go  around... wait here. Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet. Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll  wait inside, come on. Yeah, come on. How long has it been? I don't know... about half an hour. What was that? What? I didn't hear anything. Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio. Now... listen. I don't hear anything. Shhhhhh, quiet. I still don't. Turn on the headlights. See if  anything is out there. Lock the doors... quick, quick. Holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck. What! Jesus Christ. I think I'm gonna have a fucking  heart attack. Enough with the stupid voices. Knock again louder. I'm sure it would be very amusing. No. There's a bunch a us 'round  somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'.  She sleeps a lot, now... do you want  marshmallows? You sure do a lot of guessing. You're welcome. A dead one. Ain't the only thing tasty in this  house. Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my  bedtime... are you flirting with me? Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and  killed everbody? OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin  ate 'em up. Whoopie fucking doo. Thanks for coming to get us. Little  brother almost scared us to death. Look. I gotta call my Dad and tell  him we're gonna be late. Can I use  your phone? Excuse me, may I please use your  phone? Bill, why don't you ask her... she's  your special friend. Ain't got one. Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a  phone? No, none. I had one once, back in  '57 maybe... I don't know. Really  ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping  at around here no more. His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we  all call him R.J. What do they call you, sweety? I mean obviously we will compensate  you for your troubles. Oh, you ain't no troubles, no, no,  no fuss. Baby... go see what Rufus Jr. is  doing with these nice folks'  automobile. In the meanwhile please make  yourselves at home. So, what brings you kids way out  here, ain't you got something better  to do for Halloween than wander around  out here in the sticks? Oh, really... ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if  you know what I mean... I bet I got  a few moves you ain't never seen. No, he's just joking. We don't really  have any plans other than spending  the night at my Dad's house... ...which is where we were headed  when our car broke down. That's nice. Yeah, I guess I'll just help him  hand out candy to the trick or  treaters. I'll bet you are... you are a naughty  little thing aren't ya. Oh, I get it... I guess you think  you're too good for the simple  pleasures of Halloween. No, just a little too old. Oh really, well I hope something  changes your mind some day. Tiny's home. What about R.J.? Oh, he was already gone before I  seen him... but Tiny saw him and  said he said he was going out to the  yard to get a new wheel. It's an old auto junkyard out in  Baldwin. How long is that gonna take? He should be back in a couple hours. A couple hours! Can't Tiny drive us to a phone? Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even  got a bicycle. How's he get around out here? He walks, duh. Fucking great. I know you're my guests and welcome  but I'd please advise you to keep  from cussing while in my house, thank  you. Sorry. Well, even though I know it seems  childish to you all. Tonight is  Halloween eve and it special to us  so you are all invited to stay for  dinner. Thank you. You're a strange one, aren't ya honey.  I think you and me are get on like... ...like something real good. I hope to Christ she doesn't expect  us to wear these things. Really, now is not the time to make  waves. Shhhhhh. You sure you don't need any help in  there? No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of  host would I be if I put my guests  to this kind of work. Ma, Tiny's in. Go tell him to get your Grandpa. Ma, I can't, I'm busy getting dressed. You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't  hear so much. Oh. Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's  fault. I mean Earl was a good man...  I mean he never hit me or nothing,  but one day he just got up and went  pure devil on us all. What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's  none of my business. He tried to burn the house down,  said it was possessed by the spirits.  Tiny was sleeping in the basement  where the fire started. I don't think  Earl ever meant to harm us... but  Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were  destroyed and most of his skin. Yeah, my baby boy gets shy around  new people, but he'll warm up to  ya... especially the ladies. Maybe. He's a real lady killer. Well, we'll see... the night is young  and so are you... oh well, couple  more minutes. Don't be such a fucking smart ass. Yeah, it's really your fault that  we're stuck in this shithole in the  first place. Your hands, please. Your left hand  shows your past... ...and your right hand shows your  future. OK, everyone, put on your masks. We  can't very well eat with our everyday  faces exposed. Firefly. Well, I'm not much for local gossip  an this and that, but I've heard it  mentioned in passing over the years  but... I mean folks is queer and  they say things, crazy things you  know what I mean? Otis! I can't believe you decided to  come down and join us... and you  brought little Wolf. This really is  a special night... all my babies  together. Grampa... watch the language. Can we please change the subject? Yeah, showtime for what? For the show. It's Halloween eve and  time for our show. No, no, no it's so much more special  than that... you'll see, you'll be  the first to ever see. I think this  is something you'll really love. Please, come in... how many in your  party... ...one, two, three and four... right  this way. Please be seated. I know the words... fucking psycho  fucking bullshit, that's the words. That food... ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke. Check this out. This is starting to make me real  uncomfortable. What are you laughing at? This isn't funny, it's twisted. Dear God, let this end. Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but  this is ridiculous. I'm with Denise, can't we just walk  to someplace, this is getting fucking  stupid. I suppose. I mean they're obviously  all bonkers, but I guess they're  harmless. I fucking hope so. You gotta be kidding me. This chick  is wasted. How much is a person supposed to  stand? Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I  disturbing your viewing pleasure? Take that, you fucking slut! Fucking redneck whore! You shouldn't a done that. Why? You gonna do something about  it? Yeah, I'll do something. I'll cut your fucking tits off and  shove 'em down your throat. Baby! Stop! Come on, ma... this bitch's got it  coming. No, I told you... Thank God. I suggest you kids leave now. Don't worry, I'm gone. Lock the fucking doors. Of course she was gonna cut me, she's  a fucking nut... I knew she was crazy from the second  we picked her up. You're in Hell, bitch! You're gonna  die like a dog! Go! Go! Go! Get us out of here! What are you doing! Drive through it! Bill! Help him! Why? Why are you doing this? Where's Bill? Where is he? Bill? No, no, no! What have you done?  Bill! This can't be real, this can't be  real, this can't be real. Fuck you, you fucking freak! What are you doing? ...no, stop... please, please. Noooooooooooo! Well, let's go see if the nut that  runs this place can help us. What I need are some answers. You seen this girl? Say... within  the last 24 hours. Come on, get with the facts. What'd you see, who was she with,  where were they going? And... Is that all... think real hard. How's about you give me those same  directions. Enough talk, write. We're gonna have fun tonight, bro. I hope you're right, but my guts are  telling me different. Yeah... ...huh, what the hell are you talking  about? How old do you think I am? I know  who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to  your point. I always favored the Hulk. Aw, fuck. Call the chief... We found 'em. Now, what makes you think that? Yeah, well we like to get fucked up  and do fucked up shit, you know what  I mean? I'll bet you do... how much we owe  ya... ...Goober? Great story Goober, how much? Keep the change and get yourself a  new name. Come on, bro. Let's go. What's this? Now isn't she a happy little cherub...  oh well ...nobody just up and disappears. Yeah, maybe it was fucking aliens. A vehicle registered to a William S.  Hudley. Yeah, no mercy here. Not yet. Just in the wrong place at the wrong  time. Yep, I suppose it is. Toss 'em over here. God damn. Yep, I found something. Please... Tiny, please. Let me go...  help me. Please, God please. Chief said pick him up and take him  with us on our house to house. Guy's  an ex-cop, thinks he can help. Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit  on the sidelines and wait when your  own kid's missing... besides, ain't  no such thing as an ex-cop. That must be him. Mr. Willis? I'm Wydell... this is Naish. Well, we were on our way out to run  a check on a couple farmhouses out  on the edge of town... closest thing  we got to a lead at this point. Well, all we know is the kids were  headed out to a spot the locals call  Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with  some local legend about this character  everybody calls Dr. Satan. Anyway, there's not much else out  that way... so, I figure maybe there's  a chance the kids broke down and  found their way over to one of the  farms. Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm,  that's a strange one. Her part in this I can't figure...  but I will. Let's hit the road, sooner we get a  move on sooner we'll find her. I'm sure there's a logical  explanation. I seem to remember another farm set  way back off the road where the car  was found. I'm not sure if anyone  lives there anymore, but it's worth  a look. I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You  and Mr. Willis take a look around  the grounds for any sign of anything. Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops  outside. I don't know. I only saw one. What should I do? Well hello, officer. Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing  you this fine afternoon. Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it  kind of looks like rain, don't ya  think? My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to  ask you a few questions. Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you  anything you want to know. I appreciate your cooperation. I'm  looking for a missing girl... ...this girl here, Denise Willis...  have you seen her? Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen  her, sorry. Please, could I please come in and  talk to you for a minute? Maybe you  could take a better look at the  picture... might stir up something. I um... no, I don't think so... Please, just a minute. Oh, alright... I guess I can trust  you... being a man of the law and  all. Thank you. Oh, you are very welcome... Lord  knows how I love a man in uniform. Think... do any of these kids look  familiar in any way? No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em  before... ...he looks familiar, is he on TV? Excuse me for a second. Over. Drink up, it's party time. Enjoy your last night... ...where's Otis? Oh, he's coming, he got something  real special this year. Quiet, quiet, you know he won't come  down with all this hoop-dee-doo  bouncing off the walls. Now, calm  down. Grampa, shhhhhhhh. Let him finish. Who's your Daddy! Who's your Daddy! Who's your Daddy! Look at the way he lights up... Grampa  just loves meeting his fans. Oh, oh pick me, pick me... I have a  question. I was wondering Mr. Satan sir, do  you like to kiss on the first date  or is that considered slutty? Come on, my babies are getting  restless. Take his gag out, it's more fun with  the screaming. Yeah, I like the screaming too...  it's so much more exciting. Please don't kill us, please don't  kill us. Let us go, please... let the girls  go. Wait, I want to say good-bye. Bye sweety, we could of been great  together. Aw, honey you know I can't do that. We won't tell anybody. No! Let me get her... ...Ma, Otis is having all the fun...  can I get her? That's true, Otis... not that we're  having a bad time, but... There once was a woman who lived  with her daughter in a cabbage garden. ...along came a rabbit and ate up  all the cabbages. The woman said... ..."Go into the garden and drive out  the rabbit"... "Shoo! Shoo!" said the maiden... ..."Come maiden," said the rabbit... ...sit on my tail and go with me to  my rabbit hutch. We've got get out of here, we got  get out of here. I can't... I can't move my arms. I  hurt so much. That's not me. I didn't... I'm not  doing that. Help, help us. Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry please answer me. Jerry... ...is that you? Go, go! Drive... drive! Murdering... blood and Jerry... ...monsters... I... I... I got away... No! No, that's it... that house is... ...I gotta get out, I gotta get out!
