This is nicer than your other apartment. My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer. Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time. Alright. I don't think so. I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time... You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it? I'm not supposed to. But I can make an exception. You just haven't been looking.Nothing. Patrick? Isn't that special? Patrick? Listen...Patrick. Can we talk? You never noticed. We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is... That's nice. What are you doing tonight? Will you call me before Thanksgiving? Oh God, just get it over with. Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS. Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip ï¿½ to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium? Take it off. Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light. Turn the light on. Pull out, goddamnit! Pull out. No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me. Luis is a despicable twit. Mmmm...thanks, Patrick. This is Dorsia? Are we here? Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up. I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... Oh God, Patrick. Shut up. A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. Pick me up? Okay. Yeah. What time? You like it there, don't you? Dorsia's nice. I can't. Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go. I know. Stop it. Uh huh. Yes? Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that. Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick. Stop it. I'm... What? Oh, I'm...busy.That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you. You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb. You think I'm dumb, don't you? Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it. Well... A model? An actor? So, what do you do?You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one? Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird. No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that? Does he do this all the time? Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation. Patrick, you re a lunatic. Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon. Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours? I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you. Who? This tastes weird. Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at- Why would I? He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours. Uh huh? If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob. Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?But where? Where are you going? Oh God, I can't believe this. No, no, no. You're inhuman. But what about the past? Our past? You're really serious, aren't you? But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work. You have a little something on your upper lip. Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee? Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about? Why? What's wrong? I want a firm commitment. Your hairline looks like it's receding. Are you using minoxidil? Everybody has a great body now. Everybody's good-looking, Patrick. Everybody's rich. Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price? Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist. Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work. Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly. We should do it. Yes, darling? Get married. Have a wedding. Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.What is it, Patrick? Are you alright? Why? Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong? Patrick? I can't hear you. Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks. Where are you? Patrick? Is that you? Patrick Bateman's office. And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21. No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go. I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go? Hmmmm. Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to? Sorry. Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy? What's that? Who's Ted Bundy? Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing. Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously? No, not really. Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure. Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower. You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit. Want a bite? Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some. You didn't give them a name. Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want. Oh, I can't. I don't know. Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision. Anywhere you want? Oh no. I have no plans. Yes, Patrick? Yes, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty. Detective Donald KIMBALL? Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you. Patrick? Thanks, Patrick. You don't like this, I take it? Ummm...what? I didn't hear you. Yes? You look nice today. I'll do it. Oh, something. . romantic? Yes, sir. Just say no? Oh? And what should I say? After six. And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17. Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why. Late?Don't come back. Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go. I think you should go now. There was no ad in the Times. You saw the ad in the Times? No, he doesn't. Can I help you? Are you my two o'clock?Okay. Do. Yeah. Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday? Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often. Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right? Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate. Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best. Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
