Give a kiss to Edward. Thanks Miriam. Say hi to Henry and... I don't need them anymore... What's wrong? Baked in a pie. ...a pocketful of rye. Is it cold in here? No. No. I'll be fine. Like a New Year's Day hangover. The first... What? Six or seven times I went in. Remember what happened? Why did we stop? A pocketful of fucking rye. What's wrong? I've got to feed my cat. Besides, I want to get to bed early. Okay. Yes mother. No. Okay, okay... I'd be there for him. I do it all the time! It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created. He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play. Miriam... Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do? She thinks I can bring Edward back. He hates me. Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass. Almost. Mocky-Lock showed up. A pocketful of rye... No. Thank you. Thank you. They're hungry. It doesn't matter... He's mine? I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them... Good for them. I heard Julia and John got married. Absolutely. Abigail... Give her a minute. Hello, Valentine. I can't leave him! Carl, do you know? Like on a map... He brought you to me, didn't he? If you want Julia to live, trust me. Trust him. He wants us to follow. The little boy... Wait... Okay, okay... You're sure of that? Tell me. What happened? What happened to Charles Gish? If you believe that. Then what is he? Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human. Not Stargher, not really. He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster. And an innocent child. If I could reach the boy. He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed. This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore. Not to him. He never finished her. The others...he was able to make them his. You were right. There's a part of him that knows the truth. About what he did, about himself. You thought Stargher wanted to be caught. As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes. He makes Julia real for me. Why'd you bring him here? A kingdom. His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear. A horrible primitive ugly thing. I don't want to talk in here. With Stargher I saw things... Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share. Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people? Agent Novak? The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it. It doesn't have much to do with science. Do you think that's funny? You don't know the procedure. I realize that... Okay. Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead. Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world. I'm sorry, I really am. Really? I don't work with violent cases, I work with children. But even a kid lies. They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true. Don't you think Stargher would do the same? What if he wasn't like this? What if he was "normal?" Conscious. How far would you go? I bet we can fix it. Oh no... No you don't. Who says? What now? He's beautiful......give a kiss to Edward. I'll come by tomorrow after work. With dinner. I know. I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan... Agent Novak. I didn't get a chance to clear him. Damn him. Four and twenty blackbirds... What happened? Catherine? I'm about to start. If you want me to wait, or... She said convincingly. This isn't your responsibility. Remember that. Don't let them use guilt as a tool. If you want to stop, say so. He needs to be turned over. Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia. Nothing. Sing a song of sixpence. That's my girl. Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about. Want to come? Don't bring it home in this. I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time. Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here. Good. We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television. You're sure? Any more nightmares? And he might blame you for terrifying him. That one moment could erase all you've accomplished. And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone. Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened... If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him. Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world. I've heard this argument before. It's not happening. Shush. I don't want to find out. We've been over this a dozen times. No. Someday you can. We all believe that... She adores you. Lucien Baines? "Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am." Did we go sailing? Four-and-twenty blackbirds. Sing a song of sixpence... She's bringing Stargher into hers. What's wrong? I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this. Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry. Intravenous administration complete. Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy. When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers." All they did was observe and report. Nothing more. But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening. She understood. And the patient responded. Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things. He knew she cared. They took care of that, thank you, Henry. Completely unaware. Awaiting his arrival. That's a secret. You're looking well. Agent Novak. Yes. But you're going to sit down right now. I have to... I doubt that. I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest. What about narcotics? Any psychiatric medication? I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs? Nervous? I have done this, you know. Been inside. Yes. That was with Edward. She's accustomed to his world. Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory. She's "lost." Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening. And get her out. Until then, she's at his mercy. Catherine! What about the legalities of this...? When did he lapse into the coma?
