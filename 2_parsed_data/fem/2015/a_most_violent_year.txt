Yes. Thank you. Yes. Don't do anything stupid. They broke his jaw. Yes. He was left in the middle of the highway without a truck, they brought him in. Not for a couple days... Can I speak with you outside? Did they sign the contract? And took the deposit? So it's a go? Congratulations. We have thirty days? Do you want me to speak to my Brother about this? This can't continue. It will if we don't do something. Oh, fuck the D.A. He's more interested in coming after us than helping us. It's not fair to them. You're at war here. Really... because they are. And you're going out to check on the new house? How'd it go? For what? Who else? We follow standard industry practice on every front. I need to know what they are saying we did. I know it has been a long road, and that not all of you wanted to do this, but thank you. For me... Dad. Mr. Walsh is here. Andrew. For what? Who else? We follow standard industry practice on every front. You know what that means. I need to know what they are saying we did. Thank you for coming by Andrew. It only cost him a year of the kid's tuition. What word? All of them. Because they are. What's he doing? Where were you? Abel? Who was it? If you... Seems like a message was sent loud and clear. Catherine... Catherine. Katie! Mommy. Where did you get this? Catherine where did you find this? Right here. Show me. It was just sitting right here. Did you see this? Yeah, she went under there to get that ball and came out with it. Maria! What is it? Maria! Mom, is it real? A gun... It's a gun Abel. Your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door. She was playing with it. It's loaded... with the safety off. Those weren't kids looking to rip off our TV Abel, that was a fucking goon with a loaded gun looking in our windows! What the hell is going on here? Damn right we will. Who is this? What does that mean you will take care of it. This isn't a brick through our car window or some other cute little warning that I've put up with in the past. This is your daughter playing with a loaded gun! You better. Because you won't like what's going to happen once I start getting involved. ...I won't. I found a gun outside our front door. Somebody left it there last night. Abel! I'll get into it. Andrew can I talk to you for a minute. He's not here. Okay. I will. Arthur. Thank you. Ian. Well that's exactly right. And we wanted to sit down with you tonight to make sure we were being totally up-front with everything that is going on and make sure that you understand the nature of the complaints and are comfortable that it is not going to affect our business in an adverse way. Hopefully it made clear that even in a worst case situation we will pay off any and all fines and be able to move forward with very comfortable capital on hand. Well, that went about as well as could be expected. Do you think they will close? Yes... you need to go put it out of its misery. I mean it. We can't just leave it here. Is it dead? Well you need... What are you doing? Hello Maria, sorry we are a bit late. They were fine? Oh yes. All is good. Great, thank you. We'll see you in the morning then. Okay. What? Yes... what? No. I told you I wasn't going to just continue to stand around and let these people come and get me and my children. So unlike you who seems to be totally comfortable just standing around like some... fucking pussy... I did something about it. You know where I got it. Not yet. You've given me? You? Are you delusional? Do you even understand how ridiculous that makes you sound? Abel. You need to protect us. What is this? Are they serious? Abel. Mr. Lawrence is it? Anna Morales. May I speak with you for a minute. I understand you and your men have a job to do here. But we are in the middle of a seven-year-old's birthday party. That's not a problem, as we have nothing to hide from you. It's just that, we recently moved to this area, and there are twenty guests in our house... please... can you give me five minutes so we can ask everyone to leave calmly before you come into my home? Thank you. Where are you going? You've got three minutes. Our guests are leaving. I don't want them going through all this before I've had a chance to. Thank you for coming. Here you go. Bye, Rebecca. Thanks. I'm sorry. Bye. This is probably one that you are going to regret. My husband is a very honorable man. Coming on a Saturday? It's very aggressive. Really? I know you think you are just doing your job. But we are not what you think we are. And you have embarrassed him in front of his family and friends. Good for you. My husband is not my father. Not even close. So if I were you I would start treating us with a little more respect or he'll make it our only mission to ruin you. This was very disrespectful... and you are not going to find a fucking thing. It's horrible. Where is he? And they haven't gotten the other guys? Are you okay? Who? So what does that mean? We have two days! Move. Quiet. You move. Stop. I've told you guys not to push it this morning, this is not the morning to be doing this... but since the second you all woke up. It's this, it's that. Just stop. The world does not revolve around you! That's it Annie we've told you... Oh fuck you! The world revolves around me? Me! What about her? And what about you? You're both so totally obsessed with your stupid business. You walk around like you are saving the world but what are you doing... nothing! Stop!! Hi. I've made it to 1975. I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... Turns out I kinda knew what I was doing. How'd you do? You're going to see your little brother? And Peter? This is all worth it. I'll be up. I love you too. No. I will tell him. Of course. No. I know. So am I. He was scared. He has always wanted to make you proud. You know that right? No... How did you do it? This. Success... that's all he wanted. I will. I'm sorry? I don't know? Of course. I am. I'm 23. My Grandfather didn't trust any of his children to run the business. I know that you tried to buy the company from my Grandfather several times. His goal was to stay healthy long enough to be able to give the company to me. Which he thankfully did. I understand. Oh. I see. I'm sorry. Would you give us a minute. We can offer you the 500k at 20 percent for a year. So, I guess we will see you tonight? Hi. I've made it to 1975. I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... I guess I knew what I was doing. How'd you do? You're going to see your little brother? And Peter? They're fine. This is all worth it. Look at us...it is. I'll be up. I love you too. What a day. Are you okay? Car chases? Who knew? How was your brother? Stop. Enough. It was a lot of things all at once. How did it go? I'm sorry. I know. It's a bank account. Ours. A lot. It will help. You could replace Peter's money and get him out of the deal. Abel. Since 1971 I have been skimming money out of the company. Some years a little... others a lot. In the beginning it was just in case times got tough but then it was because you were taking all these chances... I didn't know what else to do... I couldn't risk having us be left with nothing. I'm sorry. Use it.... Abel... What does that mean? It's as clean as every other dollar we've ever made. I can clear it on the books. So what's your plan here? (Yelling, but controlled enough to not wake the kids.) Oh you are too much. You've been walking around your whole life like this all happened because of your hard work, good luck, and charm. Mr. Fucking American Dream. Well this is America... but it's not a dream, and that wasn't good luck helping you out all those years... IT WAS ME! Doing the things you didn't want to know about... Oh... You have always been very good about not letting your ego get in the way of business. Don't start now just because it's me. It's our money. These fucking guys...what's this additional $11,000? Abel. Abel...congratulations. Now cheer up. And can someone give me a tour of this place we just paid two million bucks for? What a hell-hole this city is.
