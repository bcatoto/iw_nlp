Tal'ama parqual! Parqual zatana! Shhhh. That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Your antenna's bent. (considers BB-8 for the first time, Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand. (stands, heads off) Don't follow me. Town is that way. (he BEEPS again) No! In the morning, you go. You're welcome. Don't give up. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting. For my family. They'll be back. One day. Come on. Last week they were a half portion each. What about him? Actually... the droid's not for sale. Come on. (To BB-8) Who? Him? What's your hurry, thief? The jacket! This droid says you stole it! Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. So you're with the Resistance? I've never met a Resistance fighter before. BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base. Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. What is it? (re: her hand) What are you doing?! Let go of me! (pulls her hand back) I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! They're shooting at both of us! Well, thanks for that! Are you okay? Stop taking my hand! Hey! Yeah. (extends her hand) Follow me. We might in that quad-jumper! We've got one! That one's garbage! The garbage'll do! Gunner position's down there! No! This ship hasn't been flown in years! I can do this, I can do this-- BB-8, hold on! What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?! Not so easy without a co-pilot! We're about to get some! I hope. Nice shot! Get ready! Oh no! You're ok. He's with the Resistance. He's going to get you home. We both will. I don't know your name. I'm Rey. Help me with this! Quick! It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know! Pilex driver, hurry! So where's your base? The Ileenium system? I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry! I gotta get back to Jakku! No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Yes! None of your business, THAT'S WHY! -- No it can't be -- Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. Get off. Get off! See anything? What do we do-- there must be -- Yeah, but I fixed that -- C'mon BB-8. Oooh... You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers? I'm hurrying! ...I'm the pilot... No, it's true: we're the only ones on board. Niima Outpost. I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain. This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo? No, the smuggler! This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...! Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on Wait! No -- we need your help! This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible! What's a Rathtar? No. What about BB-8? What are you gonna do? Can you see them? They have blasters... Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs! Resetting the fuses should do it. Oh no. Wrong fuses. Huge! What do they look like? Are you sure? Finn! That was lucky! Han! Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere. And you could use a co-pilot. From inside the hangar? Is that even possible? Compressor. I can fix that! Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank-- I by-passed the compressor. The First Order wants the map. (re: Finn and BB-8) Finn is with the Resistance... ... I'm just a scavenger. Go ahead. Why'd he leave? The Jedi were real? ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... I think I can handle myself. Yeah, you pull the trigger. Rey. Are you offering me a job? You're offering me a job. If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. I've already been away too long. Clean? What fight? Finn! What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base. What are you doing? You can't just go. I won't let you. Finn, what are you talking about? Don't go. No, come back! What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there. I have to get back to Jakku. Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could. Luke. I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this. What are you doing? You have to go back. (he BEEPS again) BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you. Safety! You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely through her fear) I hope so, too. Same jacket. (takes Finn's hand) And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life -- Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry. We're desperate for anything you can tell us. And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know. That sounds very scary. You must be so brave. I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home. Don't do that. Anything. Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO. When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star. You think I want to forget him? I want him back! That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both. We both did. No. It was Snoke. He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You. Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it. Where am I? Where are the others? That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. (a nervous beat) He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator -- -- Get out of my head -- I'm not giving you anything. ... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader! You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. And you will drop your weapon. (eyes on datacard) The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. (then, heart sinking) Our system is the next target. Han's right. Han, how? No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. I did miss you. ... Pretty good. True. You still drive me crazy. If you see our son again, bring him home. Han did it! Send them in! Yeah. Finn. What are you doing here?! (shrugs, smiles, though nearly in tears) ... That it was your idea. Thank you. I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it. No, no. You're a monster! The Force. Finn! Finn... Tell me. (hand on her heart) -- Luke -- We'll see each other again. I believe that. Thank you, my friend. Rey. May the Force be with you.
