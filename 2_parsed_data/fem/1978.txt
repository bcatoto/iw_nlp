You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it. Did you ever think life would turn out like this? He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick! Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing. Oh, sure... Twice a day. Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up. Sure. Why not. I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad. You're back.Wait! First I give you special fuck! You call me Linda, just like home. You like to call me Linda now? I show you. Come. You come. Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right? How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda? I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much! Everybody love Linda.I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine. I'm just so lonely. I don't know. That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air. I see you're going hunting. You're going hunting? What are you doing? Nick? Nick. It's okay... It's okay. I have to go now. No-o-o! Oh, it's great. Fine. Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk -- Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now. Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee. Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out. Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from. I made you a sweater. Here... You have to take that off. But -- Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound? How are you? Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so! I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car... I thought someone stole you away! I don't know. Sure. I don't know! I don't know either! Okay. What? I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking -- I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking -- I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because... Oh... You know... Hi. Nick, your shoes are soaking.Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home. Sal! Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything? Right here. Right here. Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand? You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this. Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it. You can do it, Sal. Who the hell knows! I like it, Nick. How's Linda? Sit down. Nick!... I thought you went home. When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up. I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun. Three bullets -- minimum. Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got! More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other. We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way. We gotta play with more bullets. LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO! Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you! I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick. Forget Sal. Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!! Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out! I suppose you wish you were somewhere else? I thought you might be praying. What are you, hoping? Listen, asshole, it's up to us! I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come. Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know. Tomorrow I go with Vince. Hey, Nick? It's ahead, by the tree. Promise! You gotta promise! I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that. Yeah. You think we'll ever come back? Hell no! Oh. Pow? What'd he say? Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son! Nick, he just came back. Yeah. When it comes to hunting, that's true. Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do. I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo. What do you think about? You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it. Fucking A. So do I. I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind. You think about it? You do? I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year. I just wait. You know? That way it sets. You should have put that on last night. Right. There's Vince! This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this! You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own! That's it. No. No way. No. No. Sure I got boots. I got boots right here. Watch it, shithead! How much? How much do you wanna bet? You wanna bet?He shouts, too. Huh? You blame everything on kids. What happened? Hi, Dad. What happened? Saving the treats for Bob? What time? All right. The Wallaces leave at seven. I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda. Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight. We just talked. That's not true. Here I am. Why didn't you wait for me? He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so. If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning. He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul. I can't. This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window... You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up. You guys will make a fabulous couple. Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him. What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night? I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like. For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her. I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout. What's the pumpkin for? That's probably all he can do. Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven. Probably Mister Riddle. Lies. You still spooked? Bye. I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30. Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie. I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me? Of course. Why did you hang up on me? Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later. It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much. Poor Laurie. You scared another one away. Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep! I don't see anything. Look where? Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you. I have a place for that. I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me... Come with me. Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other... Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul. Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off? I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck. Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room! Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again. Get him out of here!You're going to be late! You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie. The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you? Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids. What? Hi, Annie, Laurie... Where? Where were you? I went back to the Myers house... I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out. More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse. Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes. You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong. Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this... You all right? I'll check back in an hour. I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations... What do we do? Looks like to me you're just plain scared. A man wouldn't do that... Come on... A skunk could have killed it... Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted. Ten minutes. May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here... Lee Brackett.Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded. Wait a minute here... Yes, you can. I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around. Fancy. Annie! Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't. I'd say you must have the wrong number. What's this big, big news? Thanks. I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied. He can still watch. He was watching me. I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard. I wasn't spooked. Sure, see you later. I've already lost it. I thought it was an obscene phone call. Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death. Annie, was that you? Hello? Okay. Bye. The guys think I'm too smart. Cute. He was standing right here. That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at. Behind that bush there. Look. I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company. I forgot my chemistry book. Shit! Exploring uncharted territory? What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling. Have a good time. They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed. No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul. Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight. Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble. I don't think so... I thought you were babysitting tonight. As usual, I don't have anything to do. I think you have too much to do tomorrow. No! Do as I say. I killed him... Yes. Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside. HURRY! DO WHAT I SAY! NOW! Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door! Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs... Tommy, let me in! I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed. Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey. I promise. And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you. We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right? What did he look like? There was no one outside. Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe. Do you believe everything that Richie tells you? There is no such thing. After the Jack-O-Lantern. After the movie. I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him... 'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'... Why are they under there? But king Arthur was always your favorite. ..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..." See you. Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade. Just watch. Yes, I am. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Same time, same place. Hi, Tommy. Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand? Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door. There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed. You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie. Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?Yes. I want to stay here and watch this. I don't want to. I don't know. I'm scared. You locked yourself in. Annie, Paul's on the phone! No, he's not. Here, Lester. You're coming with us... I'm scared! Let's make more popcorn. Okay. She's washing her clothes. Yes, she is. Hello.Fun-ny. See you. I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating. Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week. Well, are we still on for tonight? Sure. It's been totally charted. We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up. YEAH? Go get me a beer. Is that all you say? Want a beer? Fantastic. Totally. I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble. That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to... And I can't keep you interested? Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note. Totally... You idiot! Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it? Okay. Later. Well, she's totally not here. Is Annie around? Hi, Laurie, what's up? Totally. Isn't that David Graham? He's cute. The only reason she babysits is to have a place to... It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you. TOTALLY! It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!I don't think this is any time to be funny... What did he say? Shouldn't we pick him up? The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on... You don't have to make this harder than it already is. What does that mean? Only minimum security. Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor. I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.' Are there any special instructions? He'll barely be able to sit up. What did you use before?Promise? Will you call me tomorrow? Michael's around someplace... My parents won't be back till ten.What is it? Too hot in the lighthouse? The lighthouse? Over here. I want you to meet somebody. Shells and lobsters and stuff? That's awful. It's all right, we're okay. Shh. Shhh.... Tide doesn't turn for three hours. I told you, remember? You going to fool around with Mike? Well, I'm not doing anything with him. The lighthouse is a make-out spot. That's you. Mike! Are you going out? She just likes to tease. I think she really likes you. I want you to meet my cousin. You're not going out right away, are you? My cousin will be here tomorrow. Seventeen. She's a senior.Okay, okay, coming.... Terry! You okay? Ready? Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally. Not when it's like this. This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite. It's either a Great White, or another killer whale. Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further. Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration. And sound. Probably. This is a mammal, not a fish. What makes you think there might be? Okay, so that's it. Carcharadon Carcharias. Do you? Could be a shark. But maybe not. You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay? We don't know that, do we? What shark? The whale's mouth? The what? Length, 22 feet, 8 inches. First things first. After we've looked, we'll talk.What is it? What's the matter? What're you doing? Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work. I'll give notice. What're you going to do today? I know you did.... They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them every- thing. For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island.... Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is. What did they.... Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened! Because of today? The beach? That you were fired. What? What's wrong? Sean's asleep. Hi. I closed a sale today, without Len. That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through. Are you going to be able to sleep? It was bad, wasn't it. Do you? All summer? Terrific. Oh. Want to talk about it? Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'? Nothing, huh? Careful. What's wrong? Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you? Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring. Thank you. I'll tell him. It's an island. Got to run. One what? Ah-ha! Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up? Where's my day book? Eat Cheerios. So's a donut. You have to smoke so early in the morning? Hey! That's my boss! As far as the office. Mrs. Silvera. Door's locked. MMMmmmorning.... Let's get the kid home. Fooling around? And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me. Why? My boss and your boss. Sure. I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal? Where the hell were you? Be careful.... Hurry, please. I'm going. Mike? Our Mike? What Kids? Who went out?I'm supposed to. I can't wait to get there. When do we get to the lighthouse? My hair's getting wet! I want to go faster! Wheee! Faster! Great! Find one for me. For me...? Come on, you guys. You going to the lighthouse? What? How fast does this go? We're going to die. It killed her. It ate her. What's wrong? Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing it now? Now I really want to see it. I've never been supercargo. Is that me? What's wrong? I love it. That's fun! Let's race for some- thing! I thought you were grounded. Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody! You do everything your parents tell you? No way. Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so. It'll be fun, come on! I'd like to go out to the light- house with you. We'll be over by the lighthouse. Is there something I don't know about? Great. I got some wine. What's the lighthouse?But the island! But we had it! We were headed right for it! Listen to Andy, Sean. Where're we going? Sean, baby, please.... Heading back? Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch. What about me? Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone! Faster! Faster! Coming about, then. Who wouldn't. Not tonight. I don't think she's such hot stuff.It's still there! No! It's still there! N-o-o-o-o-o-o.... Chief Brody -- can we go? Please? That you'll put down a blanket. I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them. Wait a minute. Promise me something. And second? What're we going to do in the mean time? What about the others? It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful. What about sailing? You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this? Double nope! Nope. With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow? Eddie, can we do that? Can we go skiing? We can use my Uncle's boat. Eddie? Take a break for a minute, okay?Ziat! Nah, just covered with batshit! Don't make me laugh. What? Want me to take over? What? You got that, shit face? Asina... Hey! I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip! We go through the wall. It's already built! There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead. We're sitting right on top of it -- here. Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent. Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least. Could be ten or fifteen. Maybe even twenty. Where? History, man, history. How much? Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em... Hamidou. Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him.

Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three. Stop shitting me, man! There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under. The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy. What is it? . . . Billy? No! Billy, what's the matter? You can't take anything seriously. And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.What can I tell you? He's my leader. Oh. Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms? The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice. He wants to see you. Lex Luthor. Screaming Help! I mean -- I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it - There's nothing to worry about. Help! See. You too. I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know? You can't do this to me! I mean the other one! Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute? Where's mine?! Where's my parachute? Danger?? Somebody??? Lex -- where are you going? What if he doesn't show up?

A night on the town instead of under it? I know... I knew you'd hit me. You're not going to hit me? There was a recipe on the back -- You?! How about me? But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in -- Ready. You ever try to run in high heels? You probably did. I don't like to talk about it, Lex. The least we can do is leave him another door jam. We just take it? You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you? You're happy, aren't you? I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.

Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean. If I do, you can punish me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks. This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here. Well...flashlight? This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right? The answer is yes. Now what's the question? Wha'...what are you doing here? Superman??? With my luck, now it'll rain. Who...who... Oh, God! I'm going to die! You've got me? Who's got you???Keep warm now. Do you know where you're headed? I know son, I know... He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so. I know. Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors. I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that... Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you? I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand. Oh, dear. That isn't what I -- Don't brag now, Jonathan. We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is. I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned. Poor thing. All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot... No one must ever know. The good lord works in mysterious ways. All of us. Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold? It's a ...baby.
