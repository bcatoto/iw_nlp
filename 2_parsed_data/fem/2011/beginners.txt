Mr. Fields, we're going to have to secure your arms again. Oliver! Olly, you can do better. That's good. Well, at least it pays the rent. I got the skills... he's got the moves... Funny? Funny? I don't think so Fun maybe, but not funny unless, like, serious is funny. Then he's' fucking hilarious. But, lovable. You are very lovable. So cute, does he do tricks? No? Arthur, SIT! He's so cute. Shake! Oh my god, he's so cute, I want him. Oh, you're being a therapist! Freud! No. You just have no real color. Uh-oh, one. Uh-oh, two. What does that me--, one, two. Two people. A girl and a guy? Yeah, wow, making moves. (in a hoarse whisper) Oh merd. I'm not supposed to. Can we just sleep? Hello, Mr. Fields. I'm Sophia. At the museum. What're you, in the FBI? The CIA? KGB? (Oliver shakes his head, no) SLA? (no) PTA? (no) BMW? There is nothing wrong with me and Pop. C'mon. When you feel bad, you go into a room and scream - loud as you want, for a minute or two, then it's out of you. It's called catharsis. You will... He's sweet. He misses your Dad. Right. Well, my name is Anna. You're worried you can't trust me because you don't know who I am. I get it. That makes sense to me. Oliver, stop it. It's black, black music is the deepest cause they suffered the most, them and the Jews. In my next life I'm gonna marry a good hot blooded Jew - someone full of emotion. You're a quarter, I'm a half, your father's none. He has the least emotions, You'll have more emotions than him, but I'll have the most emotions. You get to play chauffeur but just to the bottom of the hill. You're turning into a wonderful driver. What? You're not allowed to interact with the art? You too? You like being a good citizen? Can you toss me my camisole. No, my camisole. You don't know what a camisole is? You can ask me anything. That's a tree. And cars. Another building like this one. People in the building like us. Half of them think things will never work out. The other half believe in magic. It's like a war between them. Oh. Well, you have to learn how to read their faces. For example... here is mad. Happy... Sometimes its just nothing. This is nothing... And they are good at looking one way and being another way. And I found this crazy book. Maybe we can figure out some classic American things to do. Uh-huh. Oh I love her. All these actor stories end sad. I can tell you that already. It's not a good life. So. Now I want real Mexican food. And I want to try page... 46. No. Really? It's so good. Why? I like this place. I used to love hotels. But now I'm always in a new apartment or... in another hotel somewhere. It makes it very easy to end up alone - to leave people. You are like that? Its what you do? So we are the same? What? No... Jewish girls are not pretty. They can be "interesting", or cute, but not pretty. That's what my mom told me. No, you're right, this girl at school told me that. And I went home and my mom said, `Anna, who told you that? Don't, don't. It's my dad. I'll be my dad, you be me. (In a deep man's voice) Honey? C'est toi, cheri? You never call me back. You know, I can't stop thinking about, you know, about it. Doing it. Killing myself. You are the only one I can tell that to. You are my girl. Now I have to kill you. I know. I'm sorry. Hey Oliver? I don't know. Pretty okay. You know what? Here, give me Arthur. We'll just stay here and get arrested. You know, that's good. Yeah. I'm gonna stay here with my new friend (the handrail she holds). C'est beau ici. (Gasps ironically) Really? It's working. He looked like your dad? Good for him. Stay here. I couldn't sleep, I wanted to walk around... You've lost so much. What if I can't make up for that? Wait, wait. I don't want to stop. Ah, you're awake! Arthur says it's time to get up, he says he has the day off. Yeah. A ca vas! C'est bon! Dans ce pays! On ne peut pas amener un chien. On peut rien faire. Mais c'est con... Even if we don't answer, he's still in here (points to her head).I go somewhere else, he's still here. Yeah. Would you want a strange girl like me? Do you cook? I would love that. Why? Hello. Yeah? You OK? I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to bug you. I was nervous, and excited. I kept thinking, maybe I'm not so lost. You okay? You seem so unhappy with me. Maybe I'm not perfect at it. I don't really know what I'm doing... but I want to be here. Okay. I will go back to New York then. Oh! What about your father? What will he possibly do without us? Georgia? You leaving? Yes Mary, it's an emergency, Oliver's appendix has ruptured. Oh dear. He's a very composed child. Aha. The infamous left. And? Left again. Going in circles. I like it. Yeah, but I didn't leave. There is a hide-a-key behind it. No. Why do you leave everyone? Why did you let me go? Hey. The living room. Dining room... Oh. Crazy picture... Can I read it? I'm looking for sex with the hope it turns into friendship or a relationship. But I don't insist on monogamy. Chest? I like giving and, and what? I have a nice house with food, drinks, friends and me. If you are willing to try an older guy, let's meet and see what happens. He didn't give up. I don't know.
