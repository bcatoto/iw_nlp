Sit down. How was your night? Good. I already did. Are you coming with me to Cindy and Bill's on Saturday? For the baby shower. Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and Bill's. I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come here. Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us? Of course I am. 'Okay' you want kids? Henry? Do you still love me? Because I know you did once. What happened, Henry? He's hot. You better come with me. Hi. Thank you. How are you doing? I'm good. Listen, Henry. I have something I need to talk to you about. I fell in love. I just...I mean it just happened. I'm sorry, Henry. You're not mad? You too, Henry. Hi. I think that's everything you wanted. I am, Henry. So what are you going to do now? We're having a meeting. It's his new business. Take care of yourself, Henry. Take a chance on life, take a chance on Buffalotto! What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Are you okay? (into cell phone) Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran someone over. No, he looks okay. You idiot, you weren't even looking where you were going! Are you okay? No. Stay on the ground. (to Frank, confused) Is he alright? He just walked right out into the street. He came out of nowhere. Yes. I was. I know how to drive. What are you doing? Get back on the ground! Did you call an ambulance? I'm calling an ambulance. I think we should call a doctor. What? Are you okay? Hello, guy? Are you okay? Do you need a doctor? What? Oh. That. 'Take a chance on life, take a chance on Buffa-lotto'? Well, I guess you seem to be okay. Okay. So you're okay? Great. So I can go now? Bye. And be more careful. (as Madame Ranevsky) I think I must be dreaming. God Knows I love my country. I love it deeply. I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. But...I must drink my coffee...thank you Firs, thank you, you dear old man. I'm so glad to find you still alive. I just want you to believe in me like the old days. I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did I'm...listening. An action. I'm listening. Is this what you mean, Darek? Is this what you want? Then what do you want? Fine. I'll go drink coffee. What are you doing here? Are you here to sue me? Then what are you doing here? What? You mean rehearsal? It's a process. It's all pain. Chekhov, right? Julie. Coffee, Pierre. You want one? Two. What? So what do you think? No, I meant the poster. Actors on a tree is funny? That's the director's joke. He's making a comment on the American culture. Actors faces as falling fruit. Birth, death, the consumption of the ID. To him, the American dream has become the world's nightmare. "You are the country of apocalypse." That's what he told us on the first day of rehearsal, anyway. The irony is, he loves the American dream. I mean that's why he's here, right? But I know for a fact he hates himself for loving it. It's always an inside job, isn't it? But the truth is I wasn't listening. I was playing it safe. He was right. The jerk. About that, anyway... You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's last play. He was dying when he wrote it. It's perfect. It's my last play too. Here in Buffalo. Right after we're done. I'm glad you came by. Thanks for not suing me. I'll see ya. Jesus...goddamn! Goddamn Czech Chekhov shit! Jesus. Henry? What are you doing here? Oh. What? Thank God. You know Chekhov? Sure. Sure. Yeah. Come on in. Great. I'm in hell. So what productions were you in? Fuck him. He used to perform here. Is that your dad? He seems like your dad. What? It's not really like that. I don't pretend to be someone else. I find some part of me, and reveal it in a new way...just inside of a character. Yes. Exactly. In a way. That's the question you always have to ask yourself. So what's your story, Henry? I mean, like...what do you do? Does that mean you don't have a job? Jail! Really? Jail sounds bad. Why were you in there? Are you a murderer or something? No. I don't know. A criminal. Yeah. A woman returns to her family estate in the Russian countryside and realizes she has no choice but to sell her beloved Cherry Orchard, the magical place of her youth, the only place she ever felt safe. It's about being forced to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive. Tomorrow? Oh. Why? Yeah. It's okay. Sure. Stay out of jail. Sorry I'm late. I'm starving. Bruce. That guy's a total dick. Hi, Henry. I feel like duck. I don't just want to be good, I want to be great. And I don't just want to be great in Buffalo. Don't laugh. Hollywood. I don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto commercial. And it's not going to be. Soon as this thing is done I'm out of here. Before it's too late. I hate fortune cookies. (hits the joint) Want some? You know there's a whole bunch of bodies down there churning around. Just caught in the current. They all took the risk and look what happened to them. Same in death as they were in life. Imagine that. You kill yourself and nothing changes. All those dreams churning around down there. It makes you sick. I got to get out of here. So what did you do before jail, Henry? Which one? No! I had family that used to live on the other side. I took that bridge all the time. We must of met a hundred times! Wow. So you were one of the guys in the tollbooth with those weird rubber gloves? You were watching everyone go somewhere and you were going nowhere. Yeah. Funny sad, not funny funny. About what? See, that's funny. What about now? Where you going now? What'd they send you to jail for Henry? What! Sounds like it. You're going to rob the bank you already went to jail for robbing? Ha! What tunnel? My theatre? Ha! You're fucking hilarious, Henry. You know what? I'm hungry. (as the thought occurs) Ice cream. I can't believe I'm sitting here. I want to dance and clap my hands. I think I must be dreaming! God knows I love my country. I love it deeply. I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. Page twenty one. I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. But I must drink my coffee. Read Lophakin. Read the next line! Say it like you feel it. Like it's real. Say it to me. You're good. Keep reading! And get up. Walk around! Yes, you are. You're a bank robber, Henry! (pulling him around the room) Don't stop -- Again! I'm glad I ran you over. Good morning. Good morning, Max. I didn't know the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof. It's okay. I'm not going to tell anyone. So what were you in prison for, Max? You mean a `con' man? You mean you make people feel good...and then you rip them off? Aren't you guys worried about getting caught? How? You too, Henry? You like jail? So why would you take the risk? Is it the money? It must be the money. You are a criminal. A greedy little criminal. You remember! It's Chekhov! You really are good. He's a natural. I got to get to the theatre -- Why? You weren't in any of those plays, were you? All white! All White! Oh, my Cherry Orchard. After the dark, stormy autumn and the winter frosts you are young again and full of happiness; the heavenly angels have never abandoned you...JULIE Oh, if only I could be free of the stone that weighs me down! If only I could forget my past! Look! It's mamma walking in the orchard...in a white dress! (laughing with joy) There she is. Momma, don't! Arnold's leaving the production. Perfect. Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but that's what's happening... I don't know, he's `thinking'... What? Sorry, I can't give you a ride -- Stan. Let me call you back. (she hangs up, to Max) What? Henry what? Perfect for what? You mean Henry should play Lophakin? He's not even an actor! Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly shifting under my feet? What's going on here, Max? What are you doing? You made this happen, didn't you? What am I supposed to do now? What if it doesn't work? Okay, confidence man. Show me, tell me. Does this make me an accessory? Things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up. So why are you robbing the bank, Henry? It's not just about the money, is it? So why are you doing it? You were asleep at the wheel. Which was? Robbing the bank is changing it? What was your wife like? Not for a girl like me, Henry. I hate that commercial. So what's your plan? For when it's done. After. (making light of it) Am I going to see your picture in the post office or something? But have you thought about what happens after? Out west? When did you think of that? What about what? -- I'm not going anywhere, Henry -- No. Plans change, Henry. Okay? I think I ran out of maple syrup. Because life is fucked. It never works out the way you want it to. Right! On the lam? You're dreaming. This isn't going to work out, Henry. Didn't we both know that? I did. I think you should leave. (stopping her ears) No! No! No! Don't say that! You are twenty six or twenty seven, and you're still in the lower grades! You ought to be grown up by now. At your age, you ought to understand about love -- (with double the fire) You ought to love someone yourself! You ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes! I came to my senses. And you should too. I don't want to, Henry. Come in. Henry, we've been over this -- What? Of course! Opening night. What else? Like I said, everything always fucks up -- Nothing's fucked up? Have you looked around recently? You're leaving. What about the goddamn play? I'm sure he did. We screwed a couple of times, Henry! So what? No, really. A couple of times. Don't you get it? I don't want to be with you. You're a thief. Go rob your bank. (checks his watch) Almost two. (blowing out the candle) It's light already. My nursery, my dear, beautiful, sweet nursery! This is where I used to sleep when I was a little girl! Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood! I used to sleep in this nursery.HENRY Isn't she beautiful? Oh, my cherry orchard... I'm sure it wasn't in the least funny. I believe people like you should examine their own lives instead of going to the theatre to observe other peoples! Play's already started, Max. Good-bye confidence man. Well, what should we do? Tell us what to do? It's all so vulgar! Who bought it? I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it. We're going and not a soul will be here until after we're gone. Goodbye, home! Goodbye to the old life! Oh, my dear, sweet, lovely orchard! My life, my youth, my happiness, farewell! Farewell! (as Madame Ranevsky) One last look at these walls, these windows...Dear mother used to love to walk about in this room. (as Madame Ranevsky) We're coming. Henry, what is this? What are you doing? You should have gotten on that stupid train. You made a mistake. Ha! Don't pretend you care about me. All you care about is money. Yes. Let go of me! Damn it! Just leave, Henry! (under her breath) Get off the fucking stage -- No, I'm perfectly happy here. Let me go! Why are you doing this? I'm not afraid of anything -- ...what? Henry. You're bleeding. Oh, fuck, Henry... A girl. Look. You can see the ocean.
