Cat! Is your homework finished yet? Working on it Mama. You draw beautifully my love, but if you want to be something in life you have to study. I am studying Mama. I want to be a super hero. Better to be a doctor. A lawyer. Are we going to see Uncle Emilio? I don't know. Just waiting to hear from your father. Fabio? Cataleya, go pack! I'm packed Mama. I don't understand papa. I'm ready. I love you too Papa. (in his ear) To kill Don Luis! My Papa. Dead. Yes...my passport. To provide a safe, healthy nurturing environment where young women can get the education they will need to meet the challenges of that amazing adventure called life. How does that sound to you, my dear? Which we keep right here... And give you twenty a week for incidentals. What do we say darling? Where do I sleep? I'm Sherri. And you are? Very tired. Well, 'very tired', I'm sure you want to lay down and rest your little head? I do. There's your bed... But it's gonna cost you. Twenty dollars. A week. Peace has it's price, y'know what I'm saying? Are we clear on that? Twenty dollars a week. We got a smart one! You can go now. In peace. How much? Cataleya. Uncle Emilio? Buenos diaz Cara. Come. Sit. I'll make you some eggs. You have your mother's beautiful eyes. Don't be scared. This is your home. I don't know. A long time ago. Whose room is that? Where is he? Killed? By who? I used to want to be like Lara. A super agent. (matter of fact) I want to be a killer. Can you help? Are you trying to scare me? I've already been to school. I told you what I want to be. You don't want to help me, fine. I'll do it myself. But I still want to be a killer. Oops... Is that it? Wearing no panties? Thank goodness. Unbutton your shirt. Now. Not room service. I shouldn't drink. I'm so so sorry. What's going on out there? Really? I probably deserve it. I would have never forgiven myself. We're good. Day after. The morning after OK? Say hello to Mama. Hello Danny. Why? I have a key. I've got nowhere to go. Just what? And then we have the most incredible sex. Ever. Uh-uh. This taste good enough. No. They put me to sleep. Would you like the key back? Closer? Is this close enough? On my end. You? What do we have? Not long. No reason. I've got to get ready. Tio. You're removed. You book the work, you collect the fees... I come to you at nine. I say I want to be a killer. What kind of kid makes a career choice like that unless they have something on their mind. I live for the day that the blood of the son of bitch who did my parents drips in the gutter. Stop playing the innocent with me. You know this. Forever. Why? If you do, you would never have let me get involved in the first place. I love you too. Hi guys. Hey! Hey! OK. OK. Now sit. Now let's see what good boys you can be. Top cut sirloin. Nice, huh? Red, juicy, delicious. Stay. Good boys. Eat. Hola Pepe. I guess the boys gave me away. I train them. Of course. And the salsa Verde. The long one. Of course. As always. Not this year. I should do a lot of things. Maybe next year. Rewarding. Your ears are better than my eyes. Good idea. Willie you are such a perv. Always! Here fishy fishy! Willie! They're ignoring me! Stop right there. Doesn't matter who I am. I want you exactly where you are. You know the thing about sharks. You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers. I'm not going to kill you. They are. I brought you something. You're making fun. Well, there's that too. You don't want me? What would you like to talk about? You really want to do this? OK. Nothing much. On vacation. Down south. There was that one. It was OK. Nothing much. A little swimming, fed the fish. Now me what? OK. Want to fuck? Like what? That's a hard one for me. I'm lonely sometimes. Isn't that enough? I shouldn't have done this. Any of it. Because. We already talked. I'm late. I don't like eggs. Now you know something else about me. Don't come out. Please. Don't. Sorry I'm late. So what? Tio. Could be anyone. You're seeing things that aren't there. How many people did you kill in revenge for your boy's death? How many? And you're going to give me a lecture about revenge? You know, if you weren't my brother's best friend... Up to you Danny. I do it all the time. Photo goes in here. Bangs around the National Data base looking for a match. Bingo. Address, phone number, shoe size, dress size, rap sheet, anything you want to know. It's really no big deal. Hey guys, I haven't got all day. (holds her hand on the send button on Cara. You will come home for lunch. No Mama. One thing at a time. That was such a nice surprise. I think she's going to be OK. It's me. Are you busy? I was just sitting here, looking out the window. And I thought...where are you? So we're seeing the same sky. And I'm happy to hear yours. ...What picture? What picture Danny??? Who else saw the picture? Who else? What does the sister of Ryan have to do with this? Closer. I know. Goodbye Danny. I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry I'd like to speak to the agent in charge of the TAG killings. This won't take long. Hands up. Turn around. Sit. You mean these? Talking about covering all your bases. Your chair is pressure wired. You move your ass one inch you don't have one anymore. I know what you're thinking. Maybe yes a bluff, maybe no. But you have to figure yes, given what you know about me. This wasn't what I had in mind for myself when I was a kid. I wanted to be on the other side of things. Like you. He did. This is the last time I was happy. 100. The next day they were dead. He killed them. I didn't know how else to find him. It took you a long time. What else do I have to be? I have no one. I did. Until this morning. I had them. And now I want to finish it. Yes you can. He's protected by your government. You're going to have to try harder. I found this on your table inside. Your family, right? Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. Mother, father. Nice. I know this sounds harsh. But until I get what I want, you'll go to a funeral a week. And you will begin to feel what I have felt all these years. When your dinner's ready, the timer on it will have expired. Then you can get to work. You guys ever been to New Orleans? Good morning. I didn't know if you took sugar and cream, so I got one of each. You designed the house at eight seven six Magnolia. I would love to see the plans of this house. Yes, it is. It's Cataleya. For something you can never understand. The love I had for my parents. And you killed that. Actually Don Luis...you are exactly where I want you to be. EAT! I know where to find you.
