Shit. Mommy, can we play croquet today? Where's Daddy? He's running. From what? Shit. How was the run? I'm very impressed with you keeping it up. I don't like it. You do too, so stop drawing and eat. They're all the same. Yeah. Maybe you should show the team. Shit. Honey, you can't use that word. It's a bad word. What? Don't look at me. Hey. You OK? You sure? Just checking. Can I have more juice? Just a minute. Mike? Did you call Fenn about the tree? Please do. I don't want it coming down on the house. Mike? I love you. I'm a little hung over and my boyfriend's a moron. How'd the team do last night? Bummer. Your noon canceled so you just have a 10:30 and 3pm. The toilet isn't flushing again. Should I just call someone this time? Frank. Am I still hung over or is that noise getting louder? Leo's financial statements. He's loaded, huh? No. That lady is gone and doesn't want to be found. Can't the state just leave him in his home? That's what the guy wants. But he has Jolie now. She can handle it. I wish I could do it. I could use an extra 1,500 bucks a month. Yeah. It's in his file. (Answering the phone) Mike Flaherty's office. Let's go, Mr. Mayor. It's cold and I need to pick up some bagels for your mom's. Where? Why? No, I mean why are you doing it? What? Since when? That's a big deal, Mike. Were you even gonna tell me? You don't have time to be taking care of some old man. And who pays for that? I don't get it. You've never done it before. So why are you doing it now? Well, it sounds like a big deal. And you should have told me. What's a big deal? Ask your daddy, sweetie. Maybe he'll tell you. Daddy, what's a big deal? Is that his house? (Re: the Young Man) Who's that? So do you live around here, Kyle? Ohio? And where are your parents? So how did you get here? Really? All by yourself? Wow. That sounds like a big deal. So did you call his mother? No. Not yet. Oh and he was smoking too. He's sixteen! He's probably on drugs. I know. What are you going to do with him? Well I hope so. You have your hands full over there. And now taking care of that old man too. That sounds like a lot, Mike. Thank you, Gina. I agree. He somehow forgot to tell me about it. Not until I asked. His daughter should be taking care of him. Not you. You have me to worry about. Daddy? Can we play croquet today? The whole thing just sounds crazy. It is crazy. It's crazy. Who's crazy? Everything alright? Did you reach your mom? Did she want to talk to me or anything? Well, I'm sorry you can't stay longer but maybe you can come back with your mom and visit again. You shouldn't be smoking. Yeah. You should go outside. Good night, Kyle. We have kids, Mike. I'm not taking any chances with Eminem down there. What? What? Why? What? Kyle? We can't help you if you don't tell us what's going on. Is there a reason you don't want to go home? What happened to your eye, Kyle? Kyle. You can trust us. With your Mom? Did she do that to your eye? Who's Craig? Does she even know you're here? How do you know? She's probably worried sick and just doesn't know how to reach you. No. But I'm not sending him back until I talk to his mother. She better freaking call me back. I don't care. I'm not sending him back there, Mike. I can't. And for the record, I'm not very happy about it either! Yes, we do, Mike! We do. It makes me so angry and so damn sad to see that poor kid in that kind of situation. He's just a kid. I just want to go to Ohio and...beat the crap out of his mom. I do. I want to beat the crap out of her and her stupid boyfriend. I'm serious. Well it feels like it. I'm leaving her another message. Yes. Now. Shush! I found her. She's in a drug treatment program in Columbus. She has five weeks to go. They said she would call you. He's kind of a sweet kid but what's up with hair? That's some crazy hair, I'm just saying. Here, have some more corn. I'll get you some more milk too. Did you call Fenn about the tree, Mike? Mike. Don't start. You two are not cutting down that tree. Just call Fenn. I'm going to give her some Tylenol. Do you want to play croquet? When it's warm. Daddy, can I watch TV? Here's five dollars for lunch. I have no idea what it costs but let me know when you find out. Good for you. Save it. Now take this, it's too early to argue. Bye Jackie. Hey, you sure we should do this? OK. Go. Hey Mike, we got a check from Leo Poplar's trust for $1,500 but it's made out to you and not the firm. Shouldn't I deposit it in the business account? For what? Really? No, you definitely didn't mention that. Well can we put some of that in the business account so they don't take our copier back? We need our copier, Mike. And that noise is getting louder. I'm not hung over today! It's OK. No, I'll take him. Who was busy? Your Uncle Terry is just silly. Hello? Hello, this Jackie Flaherty. Kyle is staying with us. Hello? (She closes the phone) I'm gonna kill that lady. Oh. Hi. I heard your phone ringing and... Yeah, well, I saw it was your Mom and we've been waiting to hear from her. She didn't say anything. She hung up. Have you talked to her? Yeah. OK. I can do that. I'm sorry. Oh. Here's a bucket. You shouldn't be smoking but if you do could you put the cigarettes in here. Oh. Good. OK. Is that Abby? What's he doing? Is he gonna do it every morning? I hate you. I'm going to the market. I'll be back in a bit. Uh...yeah OK. I want to go with Kyle. Coco Puffs. Is that your brand? Nice. Drop it in, it's on me. Go ahead. How's he doing? Fired? For what? I think I have to meet this Leo. You have any home work? Impressive. You ever think about going to college? Yeah, I hear you're pretty good. So why'd you quit? You don't have to tell me. It's alright. Do you like tacos? Me, too. I make a mean taco. What? She doesn't even know us! For how long? I can't believe this lady. In the basement with Abby. This is crazy. We let him stay. I don't know, do we even have a choice? Why did Daddy hit Kyle? I don't know, honey. Yeah but I want to show you something. Stella, who's that? Ky. She started saying it at the match today. OK. So I have to ask, those tatoo's must have hurt, right? Don't lie to me. Look. I got it on Spring Break. Hurt like hell. JBJ. Jon Bon Jovi. I'm a fan. You got a problem with that? That was fun today. You're good. I'm glad you started wrestling again. No quitting this time, you got that? Of course. Why? What? You're don't even drive. Who's car did you steal? Oh my God. Yeah. It was stupid. You could have killed yourself. Yeah, well we all do stupid things. But the best part is that you got a another chance and now you're kicking butt. It's true. And you know who would agree with me? Nope. JBJ. I came to get you, honey. And to see Grandpa. I missed you so much. Can I have a hug, baby? Oh, he's just had to go somewhere, Dad. Do you want some juice? He's upset. I don't blame him. It's weird that she just shows up like that. (Checking her watch) And of course she's late, the druggie. You're gonna talk to her, right? It's not my fault if I punch her. Hi. Hi. Hi, Cindy. Nice to meet you. She's very cute. Thanks. Abby, our six year old, is downstairs with Kyle. Oh. OK. Do you want to sit down? Thanks. This is a very nice house. Thank you very much. No. No thanks. I'm fine. How's he doing? Really? That's good. He loves wrestling so much. He's a really sweet kid. Our girls love him. That's nice. I am so sorry about this...it's just been such a difficult time... Oh hey...these things happen, Cindy. And we've loved having him. Hi Abby. Hi. He left. He left out the window. That's okay. Thanks. That's great. I'd like to but don't think I can afford to stay in the hotel for that long. Do you think we could stay in my dad's house? Then, yeah, I could stay. Maybe I'll just go back to the hotel. It might just be too much for him tonight. I can see him tomorrow. Yeah. I think maybe that's better. I know how Kyle can be. Better. Mike? Cindy's here. No. But she's here with an attorney. Hi, I'm Eleanor Cohen. She retained me last week to help sort out her father's situation. She wanted a little time to settle in and spend some time with her father. Cindy has decided that she wants a more active role in her father's care. I want to take care of him. No. Cindy would like to bring her father back to Columbus. That's where my support network is now. It's home. I already talked to him about it. He seem to like the idea. She is the presumed Guardian, Mr Flaherty. And we do hope to avoid litigation. Kyle's still coming to see me today, right? I'll have my office call. Come on Cindy. Thanks Mike. So do we. OK. Is that true? We'll have to see a copy of the will, Mike. Who did he leave it too? Did he leave it to Kyle?! Then who? You? That scumbag! He never cared about anyone but himself and his fucking money. Did you know about this? Cindy please! Please what? (Annoyed to Mike) I'd like to discuss this with my client, Mr. Flaherty. What's to discuss? I'm not taking care of him if I'm not getting anything for it. Cindy, please. We're finished here. Good luck, baby. I wanted to see my son wrestle. That's not my fault. I want my father. You have no idea what my father used to be like. No idea! He wasn't like he is now! He treated me like shit and he was all I had! I want that commission! That should be mine! Isn't that why you did it? What's that? I'm his mother. He belongs with me. Don't tell me what my son feels! He's coming with me and there isn't anything you can do about that. We'll see about that. I want to see my son! Mike, your mom's here and dinner's almost ready. Have you seen Kyle? No. Yeah, right. You OK? What are we gonna do, Mike? And you don't think you'd beat her in court? Why? It's so obvious she's just wants him for the money. I do. Kyle, honey, come in. I'm so glad you came. Have a seat, honey. Do you want a soda or something? I just wanted to say how sorry I was about the match and if I did anything to cause it then I will never forgive myself. I know how much wrestling means to you, baby. No. I also wanted to say that I'll do whatever you think is best for Leo. I promise. OK. I will. If that's what you want. But I have to be honest, I'm not sure that's what Leo wants. Here. Read this. It's the court transcript from when Leo was in court. My lawyer got it. Read the parts in yellow. See what it says. No, honey. This is official from the court. It's what Mike said. He gets paid for being Leo's guardian, Kyle. And then he just put him in that place so he didn't have to worry about him. Leo belongs with us, Kyle. Why what? Because we deserve that money, Kyle. Not some lawyer. You're a big boy. You can understand that. Anything? This is crazy, where could he be? Well we should take a drive, your mom can stay with the kids. Mike! Calm down. It's got to be him. Do have the key? What's he doing? Who cares? Is he OK? About both of you! Kyle, why did you do this? Please just tell us. Leo needs to be in a home. Kyle he needs to be at Oak Knoll. What is that? Where did you get this? Mike? Hands out. Terry, stop it! You're not helping. Mike, stop it! Would you stop coaching and break that up! Kyle! Stop! Please! Is that true, Mike? So why'd you move him if he wanted to stay here. Then you shouldn't have taken him. Why?! You moved an old man out of his house to make money? Have you lost your freaking mind? Really? Or you just didn't think you'd get caught? This stops Mike in his tracks. He can't answer. Jackie turns and walks away. Home! She walks away. Hi. No. He slept at Stemler's. How about you? So what are you going to do? You can't. You told the Judge you were keeping Leo at home. So then tell her you changed your mind. No one can question that. Why not? Well I'm glad your done lying now, just in time to lose your practice. That's how we survive, Mike. Your family. You ever think of that? Shit. I know. Hey Kyle. How'd you get down here? Are you hungry? I was gonna make some pancakes. Kyle, I just wanna say - we love you. Mike? Can I talk to you? You know the transcript alone is enough to hang you. Shame on you counselor. No. My client would like to talk to you. Hi. Is your deal still available? He can stay. And you'll send me the checks? You take good care of him. I want to say goodbye. Hi, Daddy. I'm winning. I know, Shelly called. Oh, I dropped off the fan at Leo's today. Do you have time to eat. Make sure you do.
