You slept late. I've got to finish up some curtains for Saturday, and Nat and Cam are coming over. Yeah. Cammie said she just needed to get out of the house. Cam can hold her own. We need to send in the deposit for the beach condo. Okay. Bye. (as she signs) No more food. You, eat. They were just drinkin' and laughin' and oh, my god...it was like I was bein' in a museum and I saw the progress from apes to men. I saw it. I saw the future. Dewart, that was him...that was going to be him in 20 years. Oh my god. Let me tell you, you laugh. You laugh. But this little one in your arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar just like `em. Yep... Hannah! You guys okay? Yeah. No. Don't touch. (signing and speaking) You understand? Oksy. Come here. Hey, DJ. Bring the girls inside. Bye guys. Thanks for coming over. I'll call next week about the Lions Club supper. Okay. Love you. Bye Sam. Bye Cam. Can you sign s-t-o-r-m? Storm. She was fine. She's still not playin' with the others, though. She can't connect. Honey, you gotta clean up that trash pile in the back. She fished out a board that had nails on it. I still whisper. Curtis? Did you hear me? You got to be home, showered, ready to walk out the door by six tonight. What's wrong? She's fine down there. She had toast already. Curtis? You didn't eat anything? Come on we gotta go. You're not sorry. Well, you stink. You smell really bad. Stop. Here honey. Put on your shoes Good, you're up. Honey, you're soaked. Are you sick? I guess we could stay home if we need to. It's Saturday, I was going to take Hannah to my booth. You look really sick honey. Let me get you some Advil. You sure? Okay. I got my phone if you need anything. Don't forget Sunday lunch is here tomorrow. If you're sick, we should cancel. Okay, we'll talk later. Come on. Let's go. You sure? Okay. This pillow's fifteen dollars. This is all hand stitched. It takes a really long time. That's why I charge that. I can't go that low. How about 10? That's fine. Lucky for you she likes to count change. But that's what I don't understand. If he didn't do anything why did you put him out back? What? You hear me? I said if he didn't do anything why did you have to put him outside? He's your dog. He's always been an inside dog. Hannah loves Red. It's awful. Yeah? You're still not feeling good? Uh, yeah baby but he'll be closed today. Honey if you're not feeling good we take you in somewhere. Okay. Do you want me to cancel lunch today... What is that? I was gonna leave Hannah with you so I could go to church, but I'm not going to with you like this. No. She needs breakfast. I'm sorry that you feel bad but you need to drop the attitude. What's wrong with you? Hannah's in the den. We have cereal for her. Let's just start. Where the hell have you been? You're really late. You didn't even bring your cell phone. Dad. Curtis? Can I give you a hug? I love you. I have good news. Green? How `bout a red? It was like talking to a sane person for once. She made one phone call. That's it. I've been trying that 800 number for weeks. Like this. Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's a 2-1 and it sits directly on the beach. Wouldn't that be great? We wouldn't have to worry about Hannah crossing traffic. Eight ninety nine a week. You sleep well? You look like you're feeling better. Curtis. Come in. No. Isn't she lovely. Yes. Yes. Because Kyle was going to be a senior. Yes. What do you mean? Oh, I don't know. I remember it was a real stressful time. Your father was gone a lot, and I couldn't handle things on my own. No. Nothing like that. There was always... (searches for the words) There was always a panic that took hold of me. I thought people were watching me or listening to me. Are you okay? Hey. It's okay. Where you been? Is she okay? You shoulda told me we would have gone with you. Come to bed. Hi. Have a seat. I'm Kendra. I'm gonna start by askin' you some questions. Yeah, I know. I looked at `em, but I need to get a profile started on you. Look. I'm a counselor. Certified, but I'm not a psychiatrist. I can't prescribe anything to you. I can talk to you, I can recommend where to send you, but that's it. Now that said, if you want to talk, I'll listen. For a lot of people that's a good start. Now you said here that your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her thirties. And you're at 35. You wanna talk about that? So tell me `bout these dreams. I don't know what our schedule will be, but... Absolutely. Good night. Are you out of your mind? Not a word. You didn't say one word about this to me. Don't you think you owe me that? Don't you think that you might respect me enough to at least consider what I had to say? Well I'm worried Curtis. How are you paying for all that? How could you do that without talking to me? You know the expenses we have comin' up. You want to waste money on a stupid tornado shelter? You're right. I don't understand. I don't understand half the stuff you've been doin' lately. I don't understand you puttin' Red out back. I don't understand you stayin' up all night in that stupid tornado shelter. You don't come to bed half the time. You leave and don't tell me where you're goin'. Explain that to me. Please. Tell me something that helps me understand why you're bein' like this. Curtis! Baby. Oh, my God. Baby...Oh, my God. Baby. I need an ambulance! My husband's having a seizure. 41800 Tindale Road. Hurry up. He's bleeding! (into the phone) Okay. Okay. Honey? Honey? Are you okay? You were having a seizure. I called an ambulance. What are you doing? Baby what's goin' on? What's goin' on? That's why you put him out back? What was the dream? Tonight. It's wonderful. I know they just usually do oysters and fries but what if we did something healthier on the side? What like slaw? I don't know. Maybe a vegetable or salad. Dewart's been tellin' me how strange Curtis has been actin' lately. I am so sorry. It's not like you don't have enough on your plate with Hannah. Things are fine. We're fine. You okay? Who's that? What about the health insurance? I'm so sorry. I completely forgot. That's okay. Don't worry about it. Here. I hope you like them. Thanks. I brought cash. That's terrific. It's fine. Call me if they don't work and I'm sorry again. Oh, it's okay. Thank you. What's that? You flinched when I touched your hand this morning. I was in one of your dreams? Can you deal with that? Okay. Then I made a decision. We cancel the beach trip. We have enough to cover bills for the next two months with your last check. I'm going to get a job. You're gonna find another job. I'm going to call to see if we can move Hannah's surgery up. We'll need to see what it costs to extend your policy to the end of the year. I want you to see a psychiatrist. Not a counselor from the free clinic. Someone good. We'll find the money. Also, the Lions Club supper's this weekend. I want you to come with me. I want you to go. I need to do something normal. Just one. Curtis. Curtis! Wake up! Wake up! No. Don't do that. Are you kidding? Wake up babe. We took them off. It's fine. Take it off. We're fine. Take it off. You need to open the door now. What? It's over. Get the keys. Open the door. No. It's not. I don't hear anything. Baby, there's no storm outside. Curtis. I wouldn't lie to you. We love you very much. Please open the door. I love you, but if I open the door, then nothin's gonna change. You'll see that everything's fine, but nothing will change. Please. This is what it means to stay with us. This is something you have to do. We usually go on a trip to Myrtle Beach every summer. We were gonns go this month. What does that mean? Okay.
