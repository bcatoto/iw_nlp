Go on now Paul, don't be long. The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch. The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground, bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness. Paul... Paul? The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow. Paul?! The glow fades again. MUSIC: "The Boy In The Bubble"� by Paul Simon. Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe. Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is $50 for the night, plus $10 for hook ups an I'll need to hang onto an ID too. CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone. Where you heading next? England? I love London. No. Did you know it was founded by the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium? Oh. I'd love to go someday. There's lots a places I wanna go. Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The world's a big place. I need one of these though. That's my father. I'll come over and take your money in the morning. Have a pleasant night now, won't you? RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM watches RUTH intently as they pass. I was just talking. Sorry Papa. Just the night I think Uh-huh. East. Yes, but they're from London. No, London, England. England, Papa. It's in North Western Europe. The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands the towering figure of MOSES BEHE. Almost as wide as he is tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace. Good morning. May I come in? Was everything to your liking? Where's the other one? It's okay, we don't charge by the person. That was three pairs of legs I saw last night cavorting round the camp fire, right? Thanks. I got it at my church. Because of his theories. Are you men of God? God created the earth in six days and on the seventh he rested. PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet. The world is 4000 years old. Explain to me how something as complicated as the human eye simply comes into being. They eye is comprised of three interacting parts. Remove any one of them and it ceases to exist. It has the precision and delicacy of a pocket watch and, when the good Lord permits, it works in perfect harmony with its environment. Something as functionally perfect as that doesn't just occur without the intervention of a guiding hand. What are you talking about? It'd design! Nothing you can so or do can shake my belief, or faith in the sure and certain knowledge that God made Heaven and earth and created us all in His own image. Where am I? PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile. You have been deceived. Deceived by an agent of Satan himself. How can he be from another world? There is only one world. Our world, created by God the Father. PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers. How could that possibly make me feel any better? This isn't happening! You're a hallucination. You're not real. You're a test. A test from God. Leave me alone! He can't be from space. It's not possible. So, where is everybody? Everything I've ever been told is a lie. My purpose. My truth. All false. DO you know how that feels? To suddenly have nothing? Huh? I do feel lonely and unimportant! How can this all be an accident? It doesn't make sense. Did you know the reason we have solar eclipses is because the sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the moon and the moon is exactly 400 times closer to the earth? GRAHAM considers saying "�yes' but decides against it. How can that be an accident. But what's the point? If there's nothing afterwards, what's the point in living? Huh? Huh? I'm frightened. I... I'm not sure. That's so sweet. GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red. Who's Storm? This is the furthest I've ever been. You don't mind, do you, Graham? What? Maybe I should call Papa. Look, I've been missing for a whole day. If he's called the police, they'll be looking for us and if they find us, this "�amazing adventure' is going to come to an end real quick. I just need to tell him I'm fine and that I'll be back soon, okay? PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH. I won't be long. Okay. Yes? Wait, I... Yes? How did you...? What if we don't want to turn ourselves in? Who's there with you? He showed me things. I... i just want to know what's real. I'm confused. I... I... RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict. I need to get to my friends. I happen to have two eyes actually. I just have a severe stigmatism. Papa said the Lord would fix it. No shit. RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles up knocking his friend over. RUTH bolts. We need to leave now. Yes, they are. We were just leaving. I... I can't. What about Papa?! It's them. It wasn't my fault. They answered the phone. He knew all about us. He's always angry. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks. Thanks, but I think I'm going to turn in. It's been a long day what with meeting you guys, being abducted by and alien and having my whole belief system called into question. No, you go, I'll be fine. Here Clive. RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the words "�JESUS SAVES'. Where have you been? I was worried. She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge. Yes, I'm alone. No, sorry I don't. Christian ministry in Seattle. I've been driving for 5 days. Austin. Oh yes. It has an impressive bat population you know? Folks gather by the rive in the evening to watch them fly out. Turn the sky black. Quite a sight. Uh-huh. Well, I really should be getting along. Darwin, Charlotte Darwin. ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves. Graham? D'you think? Papa said the Lord would fix it. Guess that's not gonna happen, seeing as we're living in a gigantic godless universe, with no hope of salvation. Oh, that's a relief. Yes. What did you call me? Denmark has a municipal population of 508,691. PAUL blinks. I suppose so. They're back. PAUL withdraws his hand. GRAHAM and CLIVE are approaching the RV clutching a large firework. They climb aboard. How do you know? What is this, some kind of joke? Maybe I should make some tea. Where are my manners? I never really have guests. Nobody comes up here. I go whole weeks without seeing a soul. I've only just stopped believing in you, y'know? Spent a very long time trying to convince folk about what happened that night. My parents, my friends. Everyone thought I was mad. They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul. Took me away and did tests they did, said it was for cosmic radiation. They said I was concussed, hallucinating, but I knew you were real. I pulled you from that spaceship myself. Sat with you till the men came and took you away. If Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he would have seen you too. They kept telling me I'd imagined it but I knew different. Pop tried to understand but they filled his head with "�delayed this' and "�post- traumatic that'. He just used to smile and say "�there, there Tara'. He got sick when I was seventeen and died a few years later. I inherited this place. Word got out about my story not long after it happened, so I didn't really have any friends. Kids used to throw stones at the house and call me names. I just kinda retreated into myself. I'd spend whole nights up on the roof, staring at the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of you again. I always believed that one day you"�d come back and here you are. The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out. Listen to me gabbing. Milk and sugar? What for? That doesn't matter. Don't you see? You're real. I was right and all those folk that said I was crazy? Well, they can all go fuck themselves. Now, where do you suppose that came from? In back. The gang bustle out of the room just as the front door splinters inward, revealing O'REILLY in a gas mask. Storm cellar! TARA opens a nearby door and motions them down some stairs, as HAGGARD fires wildly. Crockery explodes around them. Papa? PAUL grabs RUTH's hand. My weed! You have no idea. CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror. Oh my God. Paul, we'll get sucked right up. Okay. 10...9... How did you do that? How did you know? Wait, what about Papa? The bulb's gone in there. She rode that storm with a bullet in her heart and didn't stop until we we're safe. If there is a benevolent creator watching over everything then may he, she or it bless the 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Everyone looks to PAUL for his comment but he is not there. What you may not know is on the outside of the tower they bolted a series of ladders, all the way to the top, put there by William Rogers in 1893. He was the first man to climb the tower. I climbed up there in 1976. Thought it would make a good site for some UFO spotting. Turns out I wasn't the only one. Cute. Pretty. Leave him alone! VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack. Leave them alone. WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick. You're not taking him away again. He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious. Don't mention it. PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded. What, and miss all this? Graham, I've lived more in the last 48 hours that I ever did in that trailer park. Isn't that what you said living was all about? Right now? This conversation? That tree? My next cheeseburger? I'm not afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold though. Hey, where is everybody? RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder. I think so. Is anyone hungry? I really feel like a cheese burger. Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his knees and sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up to see PAUL. You can kiss me now. They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a bit become uncomfortable and a bit grossed out. You didn't frighten me. You freed me. You helped me see the light. What? I don't have my toothbrush. Hey. I'm just taking Tara over to the autograph pavilion. Michael Biehn's here!
