Islene!!! I'd ask you the same. Take your child. I cannot. There is no time, husband. I would see my child's face. A boy. He will be strong. A warrior with no equal. Do not speak, love. You have never been able to still my tongue, and you will not this day. He will be wild, Corin. You must temper him. Conan. His--name--is--Conan. Conan? Conan?! What have you done, boy? A warrior? What you have done a jackal would do. Never a warrior. As I said, jackals. He is not ready. I will forge him myself. Stoke your fire, boy. Think you're ready? Then tell me: what is a sword's purpose? No. That is what it does. Its purpose is why you use it. Tell me, which makes the best sword? The stronger ore, eh? Then we shall make a sword of it, and tomorrow you will show me what brute strength yields. Because it had no life. The softer ore is what a man lives for. It is flexible and lasting. It survives, even against the greatest of foes. But too much of the soft ore, the blade will not cut deep enough when it must. A sword must be tempered, the two ores united through fire and ice. Through its suffering the sword comes to hold both life and death. Now tell me, what is this sword's purpose? This one is not ready yet. Conan? Wait! Hold your ground! Come. Go. There is a hunting lodge in the North Pass with provisions. This fight is over, but yours has just begun. You wanted to be a warrior of the tribe, Conan--now you must be its last. Good. Make your death have purpose. What is it you want? Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each man is free here. My wife was killed, long ago, by swine such as you. Soon -- it comes for you. Stop it! I'm trying to pray! I'm bored. Then hit yourself. I'm sorry, Fassir. I just tire of saying the same prayer every day. Of course she can. She even taught it to me. "Never again." Never again will we stand by as darkness consumes the world. Never again will innocents suffer for others' power. Never again will the Queen suffer so Acheron may rise. We can't leave them. If you are caught, everything we live for is lost! Good to know. Run! We'll die! We'll die if we stay! NO!!! Water -- please -- Let me go. I promise you'll be rewarded. Please, master! Your gold can free me from this hole! I can bring you I am nobody. And if I don't wish to ride with you? Stop! I want water. I never knew men could be so cruel. Now I wonder if the world is filled with animals such as you. I haven't lied. I am Tamara Amelia Karushan. And you? Conan? That's it? Before we eat, I must pray. Then you have no faith. And I am sorry for you. But you do. You live in a world that is harsh and short. Where fate is unyielding and hope is a cruel joke. I live in a world with a purpose that guides me, where faith sustains me. Why did you-- But -- what about him?! Couldn't you at least cook it first? Does it bother you, blood on your hands? What does that mean? What are you talking about? I've done no harm to you. I've done no harm to anyone. Are you mad? I never met your people. The one who came for us? His name is Khalar Singh? We did not know who sought us, only that we were sought. If we did not hide, countless more would have been killed! You do not know what purpose he has for our queen. Wait -- you seek to kill this Khalar? We have the same aim. He takes my queen to Khor Kalba. I have sworn an oath to protect her. I can help you. What use is talking? You won't believe a word I speak. I only want to know this -- how will you kill Khalar? You are too big to play the assassin. And the archers and cavalry? They will be napping? No. Not good enough. Should you fail, I'll be left without a weapon, helpless in my enemies hands. Let me help, Conan. No!! What are you waiting for? The fire is dying. It will never be enough, Conan. Through suffering, you will learn your purpose, boy. And you have not begun to suffer yet. I wouldn't move so fast. I bound your wounds as best I could, but I'm no healer. On the Wasp. You told me where it laid, just before you passed out. Though I can't say as I feel much safer here. Don't embarrass me with thanks, I only saved your life. We go to Khor Kalba? No. We do. Because she represent freedom, not just ours but all Hyboria's. What do you know of Acheron? It is no fable. It's my people's history. Acheron was an empire that swallowed all of Hyboria, led by the King and his legion of demon warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable. Immortal. But still it had one weakness. For the true power of Acheron laid not with its King, but the Queen. Every twenty years, a new queen from the royal line would be coronated with a crown of iron. Spikes would pierce her, slowly drain her precious blood, and through her suffering Acheron would remain invincible. Until one of my ancestors, an Acheronian himself, put a stop to this tyranny. He and others spirited the new Queen away, hiding her from the empire and all those who would raise it again. Didn't you hear me? This evil faces us all. All of civilization will fall if the army of Acheron is raised again. But -- you owe me a debt, you thankless oaf! You've known Conan long? He is a riddle to me. We have the same goal. Why will he not trust me? That is no way to live. And yet you call him friend, and risk death to help him. He's a stubborn ass. I am the one you seek. No!!! You're drinking? You were near death this time yesterday. Do you think--I could try some of that? I'm curious of its taste. It's good. Let me ask you something. Once you've killed Khalar and claimed your vengeance, then what? You will be free from your ghosts. What of your future, Conan? So your life is penance? For what, for living? And when you too die, what do you believe happens then? Nothing? I couldn't live without some kind of belief in the world after this. Perhaps. But I still die with faith in my heart, belief in something greater than one's self. What will you die with? Why is she called the Wasp? So you are taking me with you to Khor Kalba. I -- but -- who said I was a virgin? Will I awake alone? Do you intend to leave me? Please, Conan. Artus told me of how you lost your tribe. I too had to watch as my people were taken from me. All I ask is that you let me travel with you. I too have a purpose. I must get to the queen. I would rather you kill me here, than fail her again. I was wrong about you. You are no fearless warrior. Your heart is closed to all but fear -- and hate. Nice fire. Does it mean you'll actually cook the meat this time? What were the women of your tribe like, Conan? So they were equals. And your mother? So you never knew her. It was the same with me. I've always known being a mother was somehow not my fate. But-- You said earlier Khor Kalba will bring only death. Were you trying to scare me, or do you really believe our end lies there? Then we don't have much time. Your mother perished too young, but at least she died having known the touch of one who cared. So -- do you care, Conan? I've only ever heard you speak of what you'd die for, Conan. What would you live for? I thought that may work. I see you clearly now, finally, after all this time. (she kisses him deeply) I would be that which you live for, Conan, if you would have me. You may have faith in nothing, Conan -- but I have faith in you. What will I wear? I don't understand why I couldn't be dressed as you are. I look like a whore. Is there not a living thing you can be at peace with? So we must try to scale the cliff. Catacombs? You mean sewers. A warning. These catacombs are connected to the sea. It says that the beasts of Acheron protect its secrets. Where now? Oh!!! Something touched me. Something slimy. What is that? Where is Ilira? She was taken away by Fariq. Then I'm too late. Cimmerians aren't the only women who know how to fight. And to kill. Our duty was to keep the queen safe. We failed. But if Khalar brings her to Acheron, it will rise again -- and all our peoples' sacrifice is for nothing. 88. So if the queen is not free by the stroke of midnight -- she must be already dead. No. You kept your word, I'll keep mine. I pray you fulfill your debt. Don't kill him. We need to find out which way Ilira was taken. Tell us where the last girl was taken. Your debt -- Ilira! She's dead. It's over. No. It can't be -- No! This is no empire, only a graveyard. Stop. You don't know what you are about to do. He'll--be---here--sooner. Conan!!! Conan! Conan, you know what you must do. Kill me. It is the only way to end this. My death gives others life. You must. Your parents both understood that purpose. Now it is yours. Live, Conan.
