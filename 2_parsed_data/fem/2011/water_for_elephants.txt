How's your pipe, kid? Camel leads the slack-jawed Jacob away. Tell me the truth. What's wrong with him? Jacob hesitates before answering, then: And if he rests? Then you have to put him down. Jacob is impressed by her...and a little surprised. But August won't let you. But August won't like it. No. I'll keep him calm. Jacob respects Marlena's fortitude...Jacob raises the rifle and aims, trembling...Stoic Marlena, tears in her eyes, turns her face away...Jacob pauses, upset...then...shoots. I'll be sorry to see you go, Mr. Jankowski. She exits O.S. with the rifle. I know....Thank you. This relaxes Jacob, but he senses she is still sad. And please, call me Marlena. I'm not a snob like everybody thinks. Jacob smiles. He faces Rosie and tries to cheer Marlena up. I think you two are engaged. They laugh. Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena. A HARMONICA PLAYS A TUNE in the distance. They turn towards the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent. All the workmen have left. Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them. There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk. Her hand and Jacob's come very close to overlapping. When their eyes meet, one of them quickly averts their glance...There is clearly a growing attraction between them. But it's uncomfortable. I think Rosie likes music. That harmonica song is lovely. What? (overlaps, realizing) --"�Confessin' that I love you."� Beat. Jacob tries not to laugh. They return to stroking Rosie, trying not to look at each other. I'm so glad you could come. Would you like a beer? Or champagne? People don't realize how much August does holding everything together. How difficult it is in these times. The whole company is like a family to him. And Silver Star. August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena... Darling. Darling, please.. Gently. We have a guest. August stares at her. His expression darkens - locking his eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining her. Marlena smiles and strokes his face. August doesn't respond. He remains intense... Darling, what is it? August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete control, as if searching for proof of something he can't trust. His grip tightens, hurting her. Alerted, Jacob sits up, prepared to intervene...But Marlena shows no sign of fear. She knows exactly what to do. August, dear... She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it. You don't know your own strength, my love. And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens, relaxes, almost into sadness...as if he's about to cry....Marlena senses it immediately. She whispers lovingly. Auggie? August stops and eyes the bed beyond them. He leaves Marlena and throws himself face first on the bed. Excuse me, Jacob. Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August, lifting his legs onto the bed, taking off his shoes. August begins snoring. Oh yes. He's just had too much to drink, that's all. I hope you had a good time tonight. I wanted so much to make things up to you. Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt horrible about what happened. He really does like you Jacob. But it's hard for him. He's under a lot of pressure. He does more than people realize holding things together. Well it's true... (Opens her arms to him.) One dance before you go? Jacob cautiously approaches. Marlena takes his hands but when Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against her bare back, he almost swoons. They slow dance. Both tipsy. Jankowski is Polish isn't it? Yes, of course, sorry...I just think it's interesting. I don't know what I am, besides August's wife....I grew up in foster homes since I was a baby. Kentucky, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas...I must have covered a dozen states by the time I was 17. I'd make up stories about who my parents were... When I was five, I pretended for a whole year my mother was an Appaloosa mare... They both laugh. I did! ... and I pretended that I was really an Appaloosa filly...and that I was just dreaming I was a girl and one day, I'd wake up...and I'd run home. Anyway, I was a lot safer inside those stables than I ever was inside those homes... Marlena stops, not wanting to continue. Jacob finds a new route for her conversation. There was a parade for the circus. At the head, there were six black Fresians, 17 hands high wearing red tassles. So proud! So beautiful. And August was leading them. The second he looked at me, the way he looked at me, I knew I'd never live with strangers again. And the way he talked. Told me "I'd find a home in every city..welcomed in every town...and he'd give me-- Ha, you too, huh? It's a wonderful lie, isn't it? But he said he'd make me a Star Attraction and he did. I'm pretty lucky he found me. Jacob, lost in her eyes and her voice, blurts out: You're sweet to say so. Beat. Feeling exposed, Jacob searches to change the subject: Don't tell him what happened... Jacob takes this as an intimate moment between them. That's the name of the song. "Don't Tell Him What Happened To Me"�. Ruth Etting. She's one of my favorites. Jacob's head starts spinning. Marlena takes care of him; Are you much of a wine drinker? Maybe you should go to bed. Here, let me...We can't let you go out there all untied. A circus is a small town. What will people say? As Marlena ties his tie, Jacob's eyes simply rest on Marlena's face - sinking deeper in love. When Marlena finishes, she looks up to Jacob...She can tell Jacob is enamoured. She smiles warmly, touching his cheek... Sweet, sweet Jacob... (Lowers her hand) Good night. Marlena turns and disappears behind the velvet curtain. Jacob stands still for a moment, then exits. Oh Jacob... August rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of Marlena in Jacob's arms. He immediately tenses up. Bring her to my tent, it's closer. You better before she gets at my -- No, thank you. Awkward beat. Marlena takes her champagne glass and drinks the last of it. August tries to make light of it. Hook? That's an unfortunate choice of words. Jacob, what you know about August is pretty much nothing. You know how many star acts we've had? How much money we've made and lost and made...? Silver Star paid for our new stateroom and look what happened to him. Everything August touches gets fed to the cats one way or another. He'll never change. Jacob is moved. Marlena shifts gears and rises. I want to dance. I want to dance now! She pulls him up onto the dance floor. Marlena dances light as air. She spins from Jacob then returns to his arms, so that her back is to him. Jacob's forearm is on her collarbone - skin to skin. Her chest rises and falls under his arm. Her hair under his chin, Jacob can smell her fragrance - then she unwinds away from, like a ribbon. When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance - including Marlena. Jacob beams. He looks up to the bar: August stands stock still. His eyes glaring at Jacob. The dark expression we've come to know. Seething with quiet rage. Jacob takes a step back from Marlena when suddenly they hear; Lord, that was close...Aw, look at my stockings! And they're silk too. I want to see the Empire State Building. I don't know where he is, do you? And he doesn't know where we are. It's not our fault. Like you said, who knows how long it'll take us to get back. Jacob is hesitant. Marlena takes his hand and softly pleads; Just a few hours, Jacob. For just a few hours, we don't belong anywhere...we don't belong to anyone...Please. I've never seen so far. Have you? (Jacob shakes head) Look at it. As far as the eye can see and it's nowhere near all that's out there. Jacob notices tears in her eyes. Yes. No. Yes, hahaha I'm fine. I'm a complete mess...ha... Sorry. But Jacob understands; He screams and Marlena joins in. Jacob? I need you to do something for me. Promise me you will. I want you to go. I want you get away from us, from the show. You're smart Jacob. You deserve better than us. Leave as soon as you can or something terrible's going to happen. It's all right. No one can hear. We'll never get another chance to say it all. Marlena looks into Jacob's eyes and finally addresses what they're both thinking; Nothing can ever happen with us, you know. It's too dangerous. August will never let me go. You don't know what he's capable of. I'm not. I don't have to feel afraid of him if I don't feel anything...After all these years, I've learned how to do it so well. I tell myself, "I'm managing. I can manage him. August loves me. Nobody else ever did. Who am I to say it's the wrong kind of love?"� .. See, there's no place for a woman like me in any decent kind of world. You know where they found me when I was a baby? ... ...In an alley behind a whore house in Baltimore wrapped in newspaper. No one even bothered to leave a note...This circus, my horses - this is the only kind of life I can have. August made a woman like me a star attraction...I'm lucky. And I'm safe...And I was fine - before you came. Jacob feels sorry and hopeful at the same time... There's nothing that can cause a woman so much trouble as a good man. Don't say that. See? ... Look what we've done to you already. She touches Jacob's face gently. Until this moment, they didn't realize how close they are to each other tracing Jacob's face with her hands, as he leans in closer... Sweet Jacob. Am I still a girl? I feel so old. They kiss. They stop and silently acknowledge where this is going. As they move towards a secluded spot, they continue to kiss in between lines; This can only be tonight. We have to go back. Promise me you understand. Promise me you'll suffer. Promise you'll look in my eyes the whole time. You'd have to be a Rockefeller... August would find me. He always does. Jacob you promised. You said you understood it was only tonight. Where were you when I was 17? Jacob smiles. They kiss not wanting to let go. Marlena pulls away and runs into the cab. Jacob watches it drive away. Good morning Jacob, how are you? Marlena smiles. Jacob senses others eavesdropping...but the table is far enough away, so they can't be heard. About what? Is something wrong? Oh Jacob, champagne completely overwhelms my senses..I always feel the better for it when I abstain. All I remember is getting pushed by the crowd and then running and getting a hole in my stocking. I don't even know how I got home. I don't remember a thing. Ha,ha Jacob, it's silly of you to apologize for my torn stockings. You weren't even there. Jacob is crushed by her reaction. Marlena maintains her upbeat facade. August enters with his tray of food and crosses to them. He is smiling like a man who has spent the night having great sex. August kisses Marlena right in front of Jacob. It is a long sensual kiss...a holdover from their night together. August, please. We're in public. Jacob understands his meaning and is quietly devastated. I told you, sweetheart. We got pushed apart by the crowd. This older married couple brought me to the ferry. You're welcome, Jacob. As Marlena exits with the others, we discover August watching from them a distance; August's expression tells us he knows what they are hiding. I wonder if you could help me. I've planned a surprise for August. He's been so wonderful, don't you think? Could you make sure Rosie is staked in my tent after the show? Thank you so much...Oh, and I'm sure it would be nice for August if you were there too. Marlena turns and exits O.S. Jacob isn't sure what to think. Oh, he'll be here any second. Jacob, can you open this for me? Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork. Rosie's trunk is curious, inspecting the bottle in Jacob's hand. Jacob laughs. Marlena sees and laughs as well. (indicating the necklace) Oh. No...Do you see Jacob? To August - an authentic miracle man because he made a star attraction out of me. Don't be silly. I couldn't wait for you to come. What? Auggie, you're being silly. August don't do this! August, please, there's nothing- Auggie, please... Don't you see how much I love you? Auggie? Are you all right now?... August looks at her. Marlena's expression is one of care and concern. Jacob watches carefully. Has it passed? Suddenly, August flicks his lit cigarette into Rosie's open mouth - Rosie reacts and Jacob moves to help her - as August grabs Marlena, shoving her so hard she falls against the table, knocking it and her to the ground. He attacks her, trying to rip off her diamond necklace. Jacob attacks August, pulling him off of Marlena. JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT: savagely pounding each other's faces, crashing against broken plates and spilled gravy, banging their heads viciously against the ground, rolling over each other as they alternately share domination... Marlena screams for them to stop. Rosie bellows, pulling on her leg chain. The FIGHT SPILLS OUT OF THE TENT INTO THE CIRCUS GROUNDS. I'm sorry. I had nowhere to go. I told him I'm leaving him. Looks worse than it feels. (Re: Jacob's face, laughs) Ha, look at the two of us. Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's stares. She sees the moonshine and breaks the ice. Can I have a swig of that? We're being run out. Apparently, August was so optimistic about money coming in for Rosie, he figured he'd double down and find himself a new fat lady to put him really toe to toe with Ringling...So he sent Mr. Erwin into town who finds this rather large woman in a restaurant and offers her the job. Except, she... ...she was the police chief's wife. Mr. Erwin got a left hook in the jaw and we got til morning to get out of town. This cracks everybody up. Laughter. A release of tension. But the laughter turns to quiet sadness as the reality of their situation sinks in....Marlena looks to Jacob and leans into his arms. He holds her, clearly in love, then ushers her out of the room for privacy. Walter sees what he knew all along. He kisses Queenie: Why are you hiding that roustabout? My God. No. He thinks I'm with Barbara and the girls. He won't go there. And after that? August has all our money. Where will I go? Oh Jacob, that would be wonderful. You know, I bet Ringling would take us both then - they'd be getting a vet and a star attraction - that's a sweet deal for them. Although I won't be a star but I don't care. I'll take no billing at all...We'd be safe from August if we were with Ringling. Of course, I'd have to wait a while until I can work again... Jacob...I'm going to have a baby. Jacob is stunned...then confused... It's yours. Please don't ask me how I know...Is it all right? You can change your mind. I'd understand. Overwhelmed, Jacob keeps kissing her. Marlena lets go of all the anxiety she had about him. He loves her. She knows it. (Cries, relieved) I will...I promise...as soon as I stop being terrified. Jacob kisses her. He guides her to the ground, against the hay. She nestles in his arms. I'm so tired. Poor Kid...Help me with him.. Don't talk. Jacob nods. They cover him, pick him up and carry him off. What happens now?
