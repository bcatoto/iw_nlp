Thank you, Bishop. It's open! Bishop pushes the door open, steps into... I'll just be a minute. We catch a GLIMPSE of the WOMAN. A towel over her hair, wearing a skirt and a bra, crossing from the bathroom into her bedroom. Even in the small glimpse, she's beautiful. Bishop looks down at a coffee table. Magazines, newspaper. A picture of the first Mark's elaborate funeral. You don't have to apologize. I'm just glad you're here now. Are you hungry? She starts to move by him, his hand catches her arm and she is in his arms, holding him TIGHT, kissing him. Was there another woman? Liar. It's alright. I don't mind. (Suddenly shifting gears) I... I made something for you. She picks up a remote, fire up a large flatscreen TV. Hits a button. A moment, then an IMAGE flickers to life. ON THE TV: The WOMAN, sitting in this same living room. She wears a long sleeve shirt over panties. Sips a glass of wine. Smiles warm at the camera. The silence of late night. Everybody spoke about you, of course. We should go up there sometime, just the two of us... ON THE TV: She reaches towards the camera and the image JUMPS AHEAD. Another night, late. The WOMAN enters the frame, now wearing a stunning black party dress. Why weren't you here to take me home and make love to me...? She blows a kiss. Closes her eyes... ON BISHOP: Watching. Emotion breaks the surface. The WOMAN raises the remote. Turns off the image. Looks at Bishop. Plain, not demanding. But caring. I know. I know. She moves to him and they are kissing fierce. Stay for breakfast? He turns. She's standing in the doorway, tying a robe around herself. A cool professionalism inhabits her demeanor. Not crass or mean-spirited, but the romance is gone. No. But there's a first time for everything. Bishop goes to the DVD player, slots out the DVD they watched the night before and pockets it. Bishop... You all right? He turns, studies her. This is new ground. He nods and leaves. She stares a moment at the door after he's gone. Has it really been that long? Jesus. You know how they say youth is lost on the young? They're right. If I had my nineteen year old body back, I wouldn't be here, I'll tell you that. I'd be out there, making it my personal life mission to bang every stewardess who ever dared put on one of those whatchamacallit skirts. You know what all that is? (off Bishop's nod) That's their money, getting moved, exchanged. Made clean and neat and proper for Uncle Sam. And I have always been extremely careful. And? And that's the point! Nothing. I tell them they have a problem here and instead of dealing with it I get silence, zippo, fuck- all. What are they, twelve? That's bullshit, Arthur. Your father -- they still talk about the guy like he walked on water. You, they'll listen to. You -- You remember that fishing trip we all took, back in the day. You were, what? About eight, right? (Off Bishop's nod) You fell out of the boat... couldn't swim a stroke. City kid. (Animated, laughing) You're in the water, splashing around. You got these big eyes like saucers, like you're sure you're gonna drown. Splashing... swallowing water... just STARING at your father and he's not making a move. Remember? Just looking down at you like... Suddenly it's gotten less funny. Anyway, the whole time you're in the water, you didn't cry out. Not once. You were a tough sonofabitch, even then. Well, I'm in the water this time, Arthur. You think it's easy for me to ask? It cuts like hell. But that's what I'm doing. Bishop eyes the barely open doorway into a small room off the office. Pillows and blankets on a sofa. Some clothes strewn about. McKenna's been sleeping here. A long beat. Bishop... nods. The tension seems to DRAIN from McKenna. He claps Bishop on the back, nods back. Steve, this is Arthur Bishop. Steve shakes Bishop's hand. Strong. Observant. No, quite the opposite. Arthur's doing me a little favor. That's enough. What's it for? You ever think of having kids, Arthur? Wise man. How much? There. Now go away. Yeah, this is just a few more days. We got this... situation. Steve hears the dark in his father's tone, tracks it. You? Yeah, you can earn some money. Get married. No, it's going to be okay now. Arthur's helping me out. Steve glances between the two men. Ego slightly bruised. We will take from our children for a lifetime what we would not suffer from another man for an instant. Explain that to me. (off Bishop's silence) Okay. Okay, call me when you hear something. Well, that's your job now, isn't it? Good evening, Mr. Bishop. How can I help you? ...Mr. Dean is not available right now. Can I take a message? You ever wonder what the last day of your life will feel like, Arthur? This turns out alright, I'm going to send you a dozen Thai hookers and a case of Cuban Esplandidos. You can return the hookers if you want, but the cigars... You will, my friend. For these, you will. ...What? Beat. Bishop SLAPS the STOP button. Elevator jerks to a halt. Bishop gets a finger into the doors, PRIES them open. This isn't good, Arthur... Bishop, those men are armed... ...You. Bishop nods. McKenna CACKLES which turns into a scream as PAIN sends him reeling. He falls, hitting his head. Blood rolls down his face. Well? Do you want to...? Who's he? This isn't about me. It's about you. You need to watch. Steve crouches down, pours himself a shot from her whiskey bottle. Something angry and cold in his eyes. You don't believe I'll do it. You think you can hide behind that cool attitude. Like nothing matters to you. But I know you. You care. You feel. How long will it take? A hundred and ten. His eyes take in her body, the flow from her wrists... He'll stop it. He thinks he's above it all. But he's not. No one is. Bishop nods. Not clear if he's agreeing or observing. Steve! Steve! I know you feel this. I know you'll stop me. I'm getting cold. Please. I'm frightened. I'm scared, Steve. Bishop looks at Steve who just keeps staring outwards. You're a bastard. What happened to you? You're a bastard, too. Both of you. Like looking in some dark mirror. Quite a collection you have here. Military? Does this hurt? Bishop smiles, recognizing the nature of the touch. Any next of kin, anybody we can notify? (off his shake no) How about an acquaintance? No, not today. Bishop reaches for his shirt, slips it on. It's open! I'll just be a minute. A GLIMPSE of the woman in her bedroom, topless in front of a vanity. She glances back, smiles warm. Laughs a little when she sees the doll. Don't be. He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom, adjusting the dress she's just pulled on. Beautiful. She comes up to him, kisses him. He doesn't respond. She backs off, moves to the kitchen to pour two wines, You know who I saw yesterday? Bradley Fliescher. He and Ginny have this little cottage up the coast they hardly use. I was thinking, maybe next week you and I should go. Approaching, handing him a wine. Do you know what I dreamed? I dreamed you and I had a child... Bishops turns from the screen, walks away. Beat, she silences the TV, moves to join him. I know, it's crazy. I don't want to pin you down. I know you need your freedom. I just... sometimes I miss you so much... He's staring at her, oddly. I'm sorry, Bishop. It won't happen again. Hey, Bishop. You okay? He stares into his wine. Raises the glass to drink. His hand shakes. No, it's okay. I wanted to be a Marine Biologist. I used to watch those Jaques Cousteau movies and just... dream. I was beautiful. He hears the simple truth of it, nods, respectful. He rises and goes to the music box on the mantle, takes out his wallet and removes the twenty $100 bills. Thank you, thank you! Bishop! Mom! Come on, baby. What's the matter? Finally, something does catch his attention: At the gate, a DHL Van pulling up, the driver heading toward him. Steve lowers his glasses. Hi... This is strange. The Rapper she's with has found a group of his buddies. High- fives all around. He glances around for his date... No, just a job. (off his nod) I have to... Hey! Hey baby! Karen's got some amazing E. You need to come try... Steve turns those cool eyes on her. She shrinks. We think he might slap her, then: Steve, baby...?
