Hey baby. Don't got any. DADDY! You see yer sign? Grandma and me made it this mornin. Welcome home, Sam. You excited, get some juice, help me set the table. Hope you're staying for supper. Well, I didn't know if... I ain't on tonight. (changing the subject) You know we could boil up that corn we got in there... Paige, get that chair. I ain't dancin no more, Sam. Quit a couple weeks ago. Got a job over at Freemont. Pick up a second shift now and then. Weekends if I want em. It's good money. Sam... They're good to me over there, Sam. They got daycare for Paige and I can get medical at the end of the year. You ok? Let's ride our bikes outside. No, Sam... It ain't right. I ain't dancin cause it ain't right in God's eyes. He don't want me doin that no more. He found me, and he's there for you too, baby. Not no more. God helped me change while you was away. You can't keep goin the way you goin, baby... He comin or ain't he? I don't know. He don't care what kinda shoes you wearin, baby. Think so, in our bed... she's funny. I thought that was goin through August? I got somethin in Pitt, but you gotta have some college for that. But you got no education, Mr. Childers. What's uttered? Okay, keep goin. They got rid all them rats? How come you sold yer Harley? Somethin will come through. I promise. Two touched down near Harrisberg. (yelling, over the wind) What are you doing?! Yeah. Whale. You said pail, I'm thinkin of a tail. What are you doin, Sam Childers? I wanna peek. Where are we? That's ours? It's beautiful. You get what's in the trunk? Lord, you're filthy, Sam Childers. You. No I ain't. I ain't doin that no more. You gimme a little shake... Paige, go get some more beans. What are you thinking? They have tigers over there? What about Africa? He talked funny. Just from a different place than us, baby, that's all. Africa? To see the tigers. What about finishing that job in Boswell? Excuse me. You. Can you help please? We need to transfer her to the bed. Get her shoulders... One, two, three... The rebels cut off her lips because she argued. These are Kony's orders. Who are you with? What organization are you with? This isn't a tourist destination, this is a war zone. You stay in this area, you'll be killed. Thank you for your help. You see any tigers over there? But they do have them over in Africa. Sure am glad you're home. I'm thinkin of a plane... C'mon, plane... I'm thinkin of a plane... You said train, I'm thinkin of a brain. You coulda said drain, or mane... like horse's hair. You comin to bed? You ok? Baby, whatcha doin? You been to bed yet? A church? How we gonna pay for a church, Sam? Yer crazy. What's that? Daddy, I'm gonna go. It's five-til and he still ain't here. You like this dress, Sam? You ain't never seen this one. I bought it a long time ago. Been keepin it for a special occasion. I never told you this but when I was pregnant with you, now this was way back, probably 1960, when yer daddy and I was still in Grand Rapids, a Pastor prophesied over me. Pulled me right up on stage and laid his hands on my belly and told me I was gonna have a Preacher for a son. (smiling at the thought) Yer daddy and I were so proud. I remember we went home and neither of us could sleep all night. Just laid there and talked bout you, bout what was comin. Yes you are. You were born to it. Just took you a little ways to get here. You're gonna miss my play. Call us when you can. Quiet now. You two share a blanket and tomorrow we will find another. Shhhh, it's time to shut your eyes... Stay down! -- stay down! -- We are protected! -- Down here! -- in the center! -- all of you! -- stay down! Hello? You ok? Where are you? Then quit feelin sorry for yerself. Them children have had their whole lives burned to the ground and worse. How many of them you see givin up? The children are your fields... ... and this ground will grow them tall. She is asking what she did wrong? She is asking if you are `The Preacher.' We started daycare last month. Monday thru Friday from 8 to 2... Sundays after first worship for a few hours if anybody needs it. How you doin, Sue? We can't build anymore. Not for awhile. Turn outs been good, but that don't mean people is givin money.LYNN Economy is in trouble, construction business is slow. Times is tight. They got the playground over in Cairnbrook. And they can play at the school on weekends if they want Well, come on in... Ya'll must be the Childers. Welcome. I'm Shannon, Bill's ball-n-chain. I'm Lynn, this here is Sam, our daughter Paige. Good to meet you. Sam... Why we leavin so soon? Everything alright?... What's wrong? Sam... What are you doin? Sam Childers... Already did. Ain't you gonna read me a book? Then let's play a game. I'm thinkin of a dog. Never mind, Donnie. Dad usually kisses me on the forehead before he leaves. You can do that. Keep your eyes closed. (stern, Arabic) Michael! Cover your eyes! No peeking! Open your eyes! In the camps. The children. They say there is a white preacher who hunts the LRA. This place does not need more killing, Mr. Childers. War upon war does not fix what is broken here. The history of this country is filled with righteous killers. That is how it always begins, with men thinking they are killing for the right reasons. And what about the rumors I have heard about you supplying weapons to the SPLA? Do not delude yourself, Mr. Childers. You're a mercenary, not a humanitarian. They say you are doing good. That you have special powers. That you are protected by angels and cannot be killed by bullets. They said the same thing about Kony in the beginning. Mary Strauss and them is havin dinner at The Chimney. Who's her date? I thought Tony Wilkes was goin with Patty Hobbes' daughter. They broke up last month. What do you think about us gettin a limo for next weekend? Wouldn't be too expensive since there'd be six of us. Hel-lo? Earth to Dad? What do you think? Honey, you ok? We ain't crammin in the back of your Caprice. We got dresses, Donnie! We'll get all wrinkled! Plus it smells in there. Dad, what you think? Can we get a limo? Dad. Please. Patty and them is gettin one. We could probably get us a deal through one of Tom Hickey's boys. Between the six of them it wouldn't cost too much. But dad... We're just talkin bout it, honey... It's my formal, dad. You love them black babies more than you love me. Sam... Honey... You're gonna sit there and you're gonna lemme talk. I've always believed in you. I trusted you, trusted the Lord, and did what I could so you could follow your dream. But I ain't willin to lose you to what you're doin over there. Ain't gonna just stand by and watch you get swallowed up by it. I know you're all them kids got, but you're all we got too. Paige needs her father. I need my husband. Mom, who are those men? S'cuse me, what are you doing? Hey, s'cuse me... Sam, what's goin on? What are these men doin here?... Where are they taking our stuff? Sam... Hey! -- Don't touch that! -- Sam! Honey, I know you're hurtin. I know you're angry, but we need to talk about this... You sold the business for $27,000? A new truck? You sold our business for a new truck? That was our future, Sam. Paige's future. Everything we have has gone to those children, Sam. There's a point when there ain't no more to give. Paige's birthday. You don't know it, do you? You don't even remember your own daughter's birthday. You fight for everyone but us. You take that and we lose the house. The church. All of it. What ministry?! They see what you've become, Sam. They see how far gone you are. You need to get quiet with The Lord. Don't say that. Don't turn yer back on him. The good you're doin is destroyin this family. Please don't leave... STOP THE TRUCK! -- STOP!! -- No, no, no! -- don't go back -- You move and they'll shoot! -- calm down! -- I will talk to them. It's ok -- we are a relief convoy -- We have only medical supplies -- non- We are only a relief convoy -- Shut your mouth! (quiet, into phone) Hello? Dad? You ok? You said tree... I'm thinkin of a knee. I love you too, Daddy.
