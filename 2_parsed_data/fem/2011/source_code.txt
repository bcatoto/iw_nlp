What's what? (looks out the window) Almost at Newark. Goes back to her journal. It's more of a hell hole. But Colter still doesn't understand. He gets up. Nausea slams into him. He hangs on to the seat. (gestures, alarmed) Okay, bathroom's that way. Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating. Go. Seriously. Colter eases himself into the aisle. Totters down the length of the car until he finds the RESTROOM. The door is LOCKED. The latch reads "OCCUPIED."ï¿½ Bracing himself, he lurches forward into... Why do you keep calling me ma'am? How old do you think I am, anyway? Like what? So you drank too much last night. So did I. Unfortunately, I remember the whole thing. Boy, you really did drink a lot last night. Of course it is. Take a look in the mirror, good sir. The mirror? She goes back to her sketchbook. Determined not to be interrupted again. Anxiety ripples through Colter. Hey. You okay in there? You left your bag on the seat. Which is a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that. I probably saved you a huge fine. No answer. I'll just leave it right out here for you. She places the bag beside the door. She hesitates at the door. The oddness of this situation. Are you talking to me? Pretty girl. And you're a moron. Disregarding her, Colter gets up. Pursuing a new line of action. The only way he can make sense of this. He starts walking up the rows. Ain't life grand? Across from him, Christina sketching. A gentle smirk. He focuses in on her. Not knowing where else to begin. I went to art school. Doesn't make me an artist. I'd rather not. He looks down at his watch. 7:41 a.m. He's been back for one minute. Adjusting the settings, he changes the digital display to COUNT DOWN the remaining SIXTEEN MINUTES. He tries again for human contact. You certainly do. It's private. And your opinion doesn't interest me. I wouldn't go that far. Christina. All of them, practically. She leans forward, eyes glinting conspiratorially. I know all about them. I'm a collector of moments. That woman over there? She's a patent attorney with three kids and a summer place on Long Island. More important, however, she colors her hair herself and wears the same houndstooth check suit every third Wednesday. The nebbishy fellow behind her always calls into his office three minutes before we go into the tunnel. And the guy with the shaved head and leather jacket eating a scone has a profile identical to that of Julius Caesar. A click of the restroom door opening. Guzman emerges from the bathroom and returns to his seat. I haven't seen him before today. He's cranky. Thinks the worst of people. Everyone's dangerous. I'm not sure I know what you mean. Who are you? Colter hesitates. Debating. Something's different about you today. Most fervently. They're all so utterly normal. That's what's terrifying about them. Perhaps there's more than one. A team at work. The patent attorney in cahoots with Julius Caesar and the nebbishy guy. And don't forget the sullen college kid. He's the expendable one. But they're all controlled by this good- looking stock broker. She shows him her sketch of Derek, the Stock Broker. Blond, blue eyed, hyper alert. The perfect Machiavellian operative. Out for himself. He'll betray them all in the end. She's not taking him seriously. He's getting away...! Colter moves aside to let them walk past. Ma'am? How old do you think I am? Who were you talking to? My pleasure, okay? It's just that you left your bag on your seat. (trying to be cute) It's a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that. Maybe you're the terrorist. This is too much. Colter turns on her. Paranoid. I was joking. I had no idea you were so thoroughly weird. I'm not entirely sure I like it. Part of what? Who am I? I'll tell you. I'm twenty seven years old. I have no savings and no health insurance. He turns back. Waits. The more she speaks, the angrier she gets. Six months ago I moved back in with my parents because I ran out of money. I got A's in line drawing and advanced oil painting but no one's buying my stuff. Two weeks ago I put away all my paints. My little sketch book is the last thing left. You see, I'm not a artist. I'm a receptionist in a law firm. The only thing I operate is a phone switchboard. Now let me tell you about you. You work at the New York Public Library. You've been eyeing me for months on this train but haven't said a word to me. You're bland and colorless and predictable. And now I see you're delusional, too. Colter doesn't hear her. He's still looking out the window. Are you mocking me? Do me a favor. Don't ever talk to me again. She drops his messenger bag at his feet and walks away. Colter looks down at his watch. THE LAST SECONDS TICK AWAY -- Get off me! But he HOLDS HER TIGHT, shielding her with his body and squeezing his eyes shut as -- Is this a magic trick or something? You want to tell me how you're doing this? A collector of moments? That's the cheesiest line I've ever heard. She resumes her drawing. Who the hell are you? Who have you been talking to? Me? No. I haven't ever talked to you. Okay, you've got my attention. Now tell me what this is all about. Are you selling something? This better be good. I'm not sure. Yes, fine! Here. She flips through it. Shows him a sketch of SEAN FENTRESS. I did it last week. Give me a little credit. You're not really on this train. After three months of riding the train, this is how you introduce yourself to me? Source Code. You are, I think, deliciously mad. Why tell all this to me? There's lots of people around for you to talk to. Believe me, I don't have the answer for anything. Stone walls? My parents live in a house with aluminum siding and an American eagle over the door. The only bike is a Harley which the guy down the street revs at three in the morning. Who's Rutledge? I saw a program on TV. It was about psychics. They say psychics have a lot of paranoia. Don't you have people you can go to for help? Friends, family? The train begins to move again. Maybe now's the time to reach out to him. She hands him her cell phone. Colter just holds it in his hand. As opposed to being the exact same person? This is so not about me. Colter reluctantly dials. As it rings -- June 11th. You're intimidated by him. You're scared of him. I can see it. He's still mad at you, huh? I don't know how to help you. She feels bad for him. And something inside Colter closes. Retreating inside himself. She works at the New York Times. Her name's Stephanie. She's just a proofreader, but she wants to be made a reporter. She's always saying she needs a good story to bring in so she gets noticed. Something like this, with a crazy paranoid angle could really interest her. She could do some poking around. She's already quite suspicious of the government. Christina's dialing her phone. Colter turns back to the window. I'm getting voice mail. (into the phone) Steph, it's Christina. You know that story you're always looking to write? I might just have something for you. I met a guy. His name is Colter Stevens. He says he's in the army. He flies helicopters in Iraq, but now they've put him into a secret project called Source Code. Maybe you can look into it a bit, okay? Call me. She hangs up. Pleased with herself. She'll call back. Just wait. None of it will do Colter any good, but he manages a smile. Ma'am? How old do you think I am? He gives her a wary look. Considers. No, but thanks. What did you mean, there's a criminal on the train? How do you know that? Colter looks away. Careful. How can I help you if you don't tell me everything about this? Can't you just tell me? He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in next to him. Try anything and I'll kill you. What are you doing? He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside. (startled, feels his hands Is that...? Did you put this here? We have to tell someone. We have to stop this. Already what? This isn't happening. I've got to get off. Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule. She's stabbing at the door release button. Why won't it open?! Her phone is RINGS. They both stop. She looks at the number. It's Steph. I told you she'd be interested. Hi. Her eyes are fixed suspiciously on Colter as she listens. Colter looks outside. Recognizes the terrain. Looks down at Stephanie did a computer search. Something in her expression worries him. She's got a database of all newspaper articles going back to forever. No. But you were. She found you. According to the notice, you were killed in action two months ago. The world stops. A SEARING PAIN SLAMS INTO him. He drops the phone and doubles over. She runs to him -- Hey! You want to get off me? The Overweight Man, wide eyed in surprise, has his finger poised to open his can of soda. What's wrong with you, anyway? She glares at him at he stands up. He can't respond. Despair surges through him. He stumbles off down the aisle. But where can he go? There is no freedom. No escape. Imprisoned in both worlds. From her seat, Christina watches him go. Sensing the torment in him. You okay? He eyes her furtively. Like a cave man who's never seen another human being before. You're not okay. He's ghastly pale. He's sweating profusely. He's not feeling well. Wait. I'll pay it. All right, all right. Getting out her wallet, she pays the conductor. He eyes her with disapproval, then shambles off. I see customer service is alive and well on New Jersey Transit. The ticket? I don't know. You looked a little lost. The gratitude in his look makes her self conscious. She turns to go. What's that? What? This isn't my stop. How do you...? A group of passengers approaches the exit area. We've seen them all before: Derek, the Old Man, the College Kid. And the small encounters: shuffling around, positioning at the doors, and the College Kid tapping Derek on the arm, holding out Derek's wallet. Who in the world are you? Leave me alone. She retreats back into the car. Colter is heartbroken. About to pursue her, he happens to look over and see Hello? Going to work. Why? What? The train begins to SLOW DOWN. I don't understand. I'm fine. Everything's normal. Is there something on the news? Some kind of alert? I'll be late for work. It's probably a joke. A weirdo guy from somewhere. She sees Colter down in the exit area. They lock eyes. And somehow she knows. He made the call. Colter quickly disappears into the other car. No. I'll call you back. She hangs up. Disturbed. As if she's failed some test. But what test? Why this weird feeling? Why didn't I get off the train? I knew I should have driven in today. But then there's the bridges, right? You never know when they'll be jammed. That stirs something in the back of Colter's mind. The bridges. You just never know when they'll be jammed. His heart starts racing. What now? How do we get to work? You guys have some busses or something? The transit employee ignores her and walks away. Hey! I'm talking to you! She stands there in exasperation. This whole thing has been designed to thwart her. Nearby, Colter sits on a bench. Yeah. Now I'm going get fired for being late. Could this day get any worse? Yeah. If only. She takes out her cell phone. The stress of her day. I'm calling a cab. Maybe I'll only be somewhat late for work. Colter watches her, a quiet ache inside. Maybe some people don't want to be saved. Wait. Colter turns. She crosses her arms archly. You can't just expect someone to change her life just like that. At the very least... you'd have to buy that person coffee and explain your reasons. She waits for his response. Uneasy at putting herself out there. Colter's watch ticks down to the final seconds. His last moments in this world. He has only time enough for a final look of reassurance. You okay? Colter turns to her. How can this be? He's afraid to even speak. As if that alone could break the enchantment. But the world is here. It goes on. That's all he knows. Finally he swallows. Finding his voice. Okay, well, come on then. Walking forward, he joins her. The two of them disappear down the tunnel. A beautiful morning.
