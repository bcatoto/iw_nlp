So proud of you, Roggie. God, you rock. Doesn't your dad rock, boys?! Roger! Look out Brad Pitt! Oh, it's no big whoop. Gayle Syrstï¿½d gave me a Quackers for Secret Santa last year. I can probably trade with Nan, though. (chuckles at the card) Cute. Brandy would never sit still long enough for me to dress her up like that. Tell you that right now. You didn't have to do this whole rigmarole, Tim. I told you it's just a little diarrhea. Well I wasn't going through menopause when you were in middle school now was I? Bring it home. Bring it home. C'mon Tim, I can't hear. Tss. Goofball. Y'know Galen and Dar Krause just did a cruise to the Bahamas? Pretty reasonable they said, price-wise. It's a little different I suppose-- a cruise. But... Look, I'm not gonna shilly-shally around here, Tim. I found a river cruise through Germany-- Viking Line, real grade-A. It's what I want. For the honeymoon. You've been to the Dells two dozen times... Because they have children. Water parks are for children... Timothy, settle. You've never even left the state of Wisconsin. Barely left Brown Valley... God rest her. Your mom was my best friend. But it's going on 20 years now. You gotta grow up. You gotta let go. You gotta live a life here. See? I always say people like that-- who live fast? They die hard. Look at River Phoenix. I just don't know. To do those things to yourself. Just perverted. Who ever heard of such a thing? You just don't get it, Kurt... Hi Tim. (re. Wade's presence) Wade's cable's down. So this is it then? Tim's jetting off to Cedar Rapids this morning, Wade. Big deal insurance convention. Iowa. Won't go to Germany for our honeymoon, but for work you can just gallivant around like Tom Petty or one of them? It's not for certain a new owner would even keep you guys on. Believe you me, Bill Krogstad is looking out for one guy. And that's Bill Krogstad. I want you to be very careful. I want you to check in with me. Make it three times. Hey man, can I bum a heater? A cigarette? You here for the convention? Ah, Bree. I'm Bree. Thanks Mr. Surgeon General. (they laugh, then) If you want to party, Tim, let me know. I'll be around. You were checking me out. I'm gonna have to tell the hotel there's a pervo in the fitness center hitting on innocent women. Unbelievable. That poor woman should know what you're up to. I am so sorry. I'm totally messing with you. God, I'm a jerk. I'm so sorry. Joan Ostrowski-Fox. Hey. Hey. Marlene's brother's back in the hospital, so bridge got canceled. So we just watched hockey. Me and Wade. Super. Teaming with a co-worker or are you in need of a partner? (off Tim's look) This is a team event, like the Amazing Race. On TV? But instead of going around the world, you look for stuff in Cedar Rapids. And instead of a million dollars, the winning team gets a $75 gift card for Westdale, which is... So who's this Joan? Well. You obviously have more important things to do than talk to me. My brother and I were just getting ready to go for fish at the Eagles anyhow. Go warm up the car, Wade. It's fine. You'll call me some time when it's convenient for you, Tim. Good Night. I'm good thanks. Totally. You wanna party? Seriously. We're going to this thing at my Uncle Ken's later-- after his shift's done. You look like you're in serious need of some relaxation, dude. Suck the glass dick, dude. A butterscotch might help. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE ON YOU? I'LL GET US SOME MORE CRYPTO. THEN JUST GIMME A HUNDRED. Well you're livin' now. Here. I bought some pills, too. Here. These'll make you feel better. It could be like-- maybe... (does another line) Whoa, shit's tight... Like maybe it has to do with your parents both dying? Like, maybe by protecting other people-- it's like you're trying to save your parents. Like somehow you feel like it's your fault? Like in your sub-conscience? And so you're not really like, living your own life fully? But dude, let me tell you this: the only real insurance in this life-- is love. Oh baby, c'mere. C'mere. You can fuck my ass if you want. But he paid for it, Uncle Ken... Who the heck's calling at this hour on a Sunday morning? Decent. Not bad. Mm. Ach, I'm too old to give a shit. Bill Krogstad told me he's switching our policy to some fella down in Milwaukee. Allstate. Says I won't notice a bit of difference in coverage or nothin'. Mm. Anyhow, I told the cocksucker to go fuck himself. Says I'm going with Tim Lippe. A man I can trust. It's a good thing you're doin'-- keepin' work in Brown Valley. Let me know when them red squirrels show up at your feeder. I'll borrow you my 22.
