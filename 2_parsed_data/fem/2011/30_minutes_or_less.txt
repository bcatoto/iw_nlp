Oh yeah? What happened to her? I hope you're not one of those guys that comes here looking to get mothered. Sure. Whatever you say. Maybe just keep quiet for a while, forget about your old man and let me do my thing. What kinda inheritance? You know, with a million bucks, you could have anything. Be like a king. (almost a moan) King Dwayne. Practice makes perfect. Let me ask you a question...do you really hate your daddy? Then maybe I can help you get that money now. Before he spends another penny. I know a guy in Baltimore. He could help you out. Probably do it for... (sizing him up) ...100Gs. Kill your mean old dad. So, what do you think...you ready for your crown? That's the plan. Five days, six nights. Culture. Beaches. Acceptable probability of kidnapping. I leave in the morning. This morning I loaded up an African Safari and a cruise to Alaska. Fuck Expedia. Travel Advisor. Making it seem so easy. Even if I could afford that...they fired two other paralegals last week. Now's not the time to be putting in for vacation days. How do you keep sneaking up here past the security guard? Interesting theory... Maybe I should set him up with Tom Small. He came out to me today on Facebook. Tell me about it. He fingered me at junior prom while they were playing "No Scrubs." So, I've got some news... I'm getting back together with Mark. Yeah, but we were talking and - You sound like Chet. Well, neither one of you seems to care that I don't have a life. Mark's not perfect...but a relationship is better than working late every Friday because I have nowhere else to be. You know what I mean. I missed you so much, baby. You know it's not like that. Those guys get Juicy, but you get Marisol. Then that's how it's gonna go. We're just waiting on a call. Well, I think I can keep you entertained. You sure you don't want to grab some condoms? Because this is usually what men buy before they rape someone, and I want to make sure you all use protection. Is that cash or credit for your rape kit? Will? What are you doing? Why not? What's going on? Will, I swear, if this is - Oh my god, Will...we'll get help. I'll get you help. Please, just let me call someone. Let me do something. This is crazy! Will, I can't remember about some stupid picture while you're - Will, this is a lot you're putting on me! You just told me people are trying to kill you or something, and now you say you love me. What the fuck is going on? Yes. I mean, I've known you forever. It's not an easy thing to figure out. Okay. I will process all of this. It's just, the bomb - If I had time to think about it...I'd probably tell you that I've always felt very strongly for you. And I've never thought of you as a brother. Try not to. Please. I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. Oh, god! I don't want the gun! No! Please take this gun away! I'm sorry! It was an accident! Mommy, what's happening!? Christi, be quiet. These men are dangerous. I'm sorry! They make us do it! No! It was Mark! He pushed the button when you guys came in! Fuck you, Mark! You're the manager! Vaughn, look out! He lives with his daddy. You already got the address. Will...? It's okay...I'm fine...I'm just really - Will, are you there? Chet!? What are you doing here!? Uh...I just got kidnapped. I just got kidnapped! Can we talk about that!? What the hell was that? What exactly happened since I saw you this afternoon? What!? So you're, like, fugitives? What do we do now? Will, that's - Here's an idea: pretend you have a bomb strapped to your chest. Tick, Is Chet watching us?
