I'm so worried for that boy. ...she was everything to him. But he was never really a father...I don't think he ever...understood Joe. Mom, it's not fair that I can't go to Wendy's. Every single person is going except me! Then every single person can tell you how it was -- It's your turn to babysit. So... Get off that thing. Mom, why can't I switch with Charles? Oh, really, guess what? We're switching. Charles take these to the table! Benji, it's time for dinner. Hey, Grab a seat, we have lots of food. What the hell's he doing here? He's the deputy's kid! Charles, I don't have a license. I can't drive with him! It's too late! He's seeing me in this car right now. Get in. You're driving very well. I'm impressed. What? I'm sorta trying to drive-- ... no...?! Stop. My dad works at the mill. I know, we read it, we get it. Was that okay? Or... not really? I love how calm he is. What's the blood? -- did someone get hurt--? (covers her mouth)) -- yeah, it's him-- Dr. Woodward...? ... Dr. Woodward? -- we shouldn't be here-- MOVE YOUR ASS, WE GOTTA GO!!! It's hard enough to drive without everyone yelling! We can't tell anyone we were there - - we can't say a thing about it -- my dad cannot find out I took his car, do you guys hear me?! Joe, this is yours. I should never have done this. Mom, come on! No. You're not wearing that. No one in this house is wearing that. Compared to Debbie's these are long. I can't wear these or go to Wendy's party? This is not fair. Jennifer Anne, not fair is Africa. Mom's racist. Are there anymore English muffins? I don't know, go check. They don't listen to me. Hi, Joe. Did you hear about the train accident? It's on the news. I don't care what Charles wants-- I said no on the phone. And now you're at my house. It's too weird after last night-- I don't understand how you guys can keep working on your stupid movie, I really don't. ... please...? (she considers, then:) No. You should go. He was just inviting me to a party. I'll do it. ... what do you think happened...? I just got a horrible feeling. -- what? Keep going. So, if it's Air Force, what would the Air Force have on a train? Where'd you learn how to do this? So how am I supposed to be a zombie? For English? Yeah-- Jack, all the tools in the garage are gone. -- you made all these? ... it looks real. (beat, studies) It looks so old... Euro Gray... What was that necklace? (off his awkward stare) The one you were holding at the train crash. Was it your mom's? It's okay. It's not her. She never's disappeared before. She's got dark hair, it was in rollers. Do you know what rollers are? She went to her car-- -- are you-- were you sleeping? Yeah. Power's still out. I was in bed, couldn't sleep. Thinking. I wanted to tell you something, before tomorrow -- Don't let Charles blow up your train. I don't think it's right, do you? I know he's your friend, but he's so He shouldn't always get what he wants. I mean, who always gets what they want? -- I know I don't know you at all. Even though... it sort of feels like I do. Do you not... feel like that? -- no, keep it-- please -- ... is that her? He drank that morning. My dad. He missed his shift. (beat, hard) Your mom took it for him. The day of the accident. ... I know he wishes it was him. Instead of her. ... and sometimes I wish it was, too. I should go to bed. I don't want to sit down. Charles, Charles -- sweetheart, are you okay? I went back to the house and you were gone. Hi, Joe. Come back if you can't find him. As if I'm gonna help you. ... does it have to be him? This whole evacuation thing's freaking me out. Making me rethink my priorities. Saw you over here and thought maybe we could kick back. I asked Charles about you, and he said you're a great guy-- Will you hate me if I start our relationship by asking a favor? What is this? What are you doing here?! How did you know? Really? Where are we? I left my bag in my car. Then I went to my car to get my bag-- It's been experimented on for years. It's terrified and exhausted and hungry, it just wants to go home. When it touched me, I knew -- Come on, kids, let's go with the sheriff.
