Let go. Let go. Go back to the house. You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr. Lyons, if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son! Or my plow, or my horse, or my field, or my farm! Oh, my pair of fools. My mighty fools. You're as battered and bloodied as he is. Still in the bottom field. It's not the drink, Albert, that makes him stumble - Well, so might you if you'd been where he's been, seen what he's seen! He don't talk about it because he can't. There aren't words for some things. Come here... The mice've been at it. Sit down. And that is the Queen's South Africa Medal. Every man who fought in the Boer War got one of those. But this... That's the Distinguished Conduct Medal. Well it ain't mine, dear. He got that after the fighting at Transvaal. After he'd been hurt, and he'd saved some other lads, and well... I don't know what else, he won't tell me either. But the first day he got home he just... tossed them out. First day he could walk, he threw `em straight in the dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word I said not to. See, what you done today, you and Joey, you're chuffed up now, and so you should be, my splendid boy. It's good to be proud when you done something good. But what he done, in Africa, whatever it was, he takes no pride in it. Hard as it surely was, and however much pain it's cost him, he refuses to be proud of killing, I suppose. Well, whether or not you think you'd do the same thing as him... Think how brave he is for refusing to be proud. Oh, your dad makes mistakes. And he drinks to forget the mistakes that he's made - but he never gave up and he does that for us. And today, you showed the world it's all been worth it. You keep looking after Joey and he'll always be looking after you. Oh, yeah? Is he a friend of yours? Well, I might hate you more - but I'll never love you less. It's the way you did it. Aren't we just. (looking up, wiping her It's a picture of Joey. Well, I never! Well, go on then, go on. You weren't to know it was bad news. You don't know that he was riding him... Grandp�re. It's closer today. I can hear it, Grandp�re, and there is no wind. You shouldn't lie to me. You lie about everything. You say you aren't worried but it's clear you are. I know the war is approaching but you say, "Oh, it's just a trick of the wind." You started lying when Mama and Papa went away. They're dead. But you won't say so. Do you think I'll die if you tell me the truth? If you tell me the truth about the war, I will tell you the truth about the big horses I've been keeping in the windmill. Yes. They were standing in the windmill waiting for Don Quixote. This is Fran�ois (Joey) and this is Claude (Topthorn). I named them after two boys who broke my heart last Summer. Yes - I know, Grandp�re. They are not unicorns - so I will be fair and wait -- one day. And if no one comes to get them by night-time, then they belong to me. Mother used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall. It will only be settled when I decide which one to ride first. At least I won't have long to wait. I was in love with a boy called Fran�ois - who had your lovely eyes. Unfortunately he was in love with a girl called Marie, who had your teeth. She fell for a boy called Claude - who broke my heart. And who I intend to marry one day. Today we learn to jump. Did you know the French cleared one meter eighty- five at the Paris Olympics to win the gold medal? Today we will beat that record. This is your jump. When I call you....be very brave and leap over it. Leap over it! Watch me. And now it's your -- He doesn't think we can do it. But we will show him, won't we? (Her voice shaking) No need to be afraid. (Emilie looking down at how far off the ground You are...very tall. Only if you get in my way to make me fall. What horses? We use it to replace the mattress stuffings. They're dead. They died. Tell me what happened to them. To my mother and father. You said you would tell me how they died. On my birthday. And tomorrow's my birthday! They died fighting, didn't they? But when the soldiers - you do nothing. You are a coward, aren't you? And you've never done a brave thing in your life? I don't want to hear about the birds. What is that? I hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that I then have to wear like last year. Yes. I looked like an ugly nun. Give me your hand. (she takes it in hers) Grandp�re, we have no money. When the war is over, then you can buy me jewels and carriages. Of course. Okay, I promise. I promise. My hero. No! Let go of me! No! You don't need them! There are so many others! Fran�ois!
