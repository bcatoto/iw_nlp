of the lobby security camera footage on a television. The time code at the bottom of the screen reads "6:02." We see Nick looking up at the camera and silently mouthing the word "Fuck!" The image freezes and we PULL BACK to see Harken holding the remote. Nick stands across from him. Boy, I have to get used to driving with this heavy ring on. I keep swerving to the left. I love it. I feel like a queen. Have a great day at work. They kiss. Dale exits the car. (loudly, over the You get a haircut? Looks good. You ever watch that show, `Gossip Girl'? I watched it last night. I'll tell you, lot of cuties on that program. Number 7 scraper, please. Dale hands her a tool. Thank you. I fingered myself so hard to Penn Badgely, I broke a nail. Dale sighs and looks down at the unconscious Mr. Anderton. This obviously isn't the first time Julia has spoken this way. I'd let that kid put it in my ass. Bet he's packing a plus-size sausage under those True Religions. (then, looking up at I need the probe. Bet you're no shrimp in the cock department either, huh, Dale? Oh, come on. You know I like to fool around. She lifts the patient's limp hand and cups it over her breast. Mr. Anderton! Bad! She smacks the lifeless hand and cackles with laughter. Okay, enough fun. Let's get back to work. Water, please. Sorry, I'm a squirter. (studying his groin) I think I can just make out our friend. Looks like someone is circumcised! I know, I know, you have a What? You're actually going to marry that little dummy? I thought you said she was just a hole for your dick. I'm very disappointed in you, Dale. (then, coldly) Scaler. Shaken, Dale hands her the tool. Excuse me? Can you sign for this, please? I'm sorry? What do you mean? Nothing's gonna happen. I'm just a UPS girl. You shut up. It's true. Why? Myrna. Okay. Oh hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt. I've just been waiting to get in there for a while now... It's... your son. Have a seat, Dale. Please. He sits, then immediately stands again. (holding up hand) I know what you're going to say and that's exactly what I want to talk to you about.JULIA Yes, I like to joke around at work. And sometimes I might cross the line a bit. But the last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable. That's unprofessional and I pride myself on being a professional. She leans back in her chair and puts her hands behind her head revealing even more of her body. So from now on, I want you to tell me when and if I cross the line. What? I'm not naked. You can't even see my pussy. That's over the line? You're starting to sound like a little faggot, Dale. Okay, let's not start talking about illegal, Mr. Pees-on-Young- Boys. Even worse. That little boy must have been terrified. Let's cut to the chase. You're engaged now. And I respect the institution of marriage too much to violate it. That's why you need to fuck me well before the wedding. Because the closer it gets, the less ladylike I'm going to feel about this whole thing. We'll see about that. (then, suddenly Not in the mood for what? I invited her. She called and said now that we're engaged, she wanted to offer me free dental work. And you know I've had that loose filling for a while. It's so sweet of you, Julia. It's my pleasure. You're part of the family now. Why not? Dale, there's nothing you could do that would be taking advantage of me. Nothing. (then, to Stacy) Now what do you say we pump you full of gas? What are you talking about, Dale? You know I'm not good with drills. You don't want your fiancï¿½e to suffer, do you? OFF Dale's defeated look -- You're gonna give me that dong, Dale! Let's have sex on top of her. Let's use her like a bed! I'll tell her you fucked me! If you don't fuck me, I'll tell her you fucked me. She already knows you're a sex offender. And once she sees these, I think she'll believe me. You remember your first week here when I replaced the crown on your second bicuspid? I took a few snapshots of the procedure. For my files. Dale lunges at the envelope and pulls out the photos. Yup. Taped your eyes open. Don't get all dramatic. Your dick wasn't hard. But it will be next time. Or else Stacy here gets a look at my photo album. She holds up the packet of photos. No worries, baby. I actually meant to call your home phone. You know, to tell Stacy about us. I think I've waited long enough. I'm tired of you playing with my emotions. This Friday. At the office. Wait. What are you going to do to me? Details! And be explicit. Say it! Oh, come on, Casanova. You can do better than that. You going to slap me with your cock, Dale? More! BANG! Harken again HITS Kurt's car from behind. A tail light shatters. See you Friday, you dirty bird. Julia hangs up. Dale looks like he's been violated. Oh, hey, Kurt. Come in. Thank you. Terrible what happened to him. What baby? (beat, offended) I'm not pregnant. I'm aware that I have a weight problem, Kurt. It just happens to manifest itself in my lower abdomen. Kurt, I know you were a favorite of Jack's. He was willing to overlook your inappropriate behavior with female clients and service people. But you should be aware, I'm not Jack. And I have very little tolerance for the mistreatment of women. So consider this your first strike. Strike two. Kurt opens his mouth to say something but thinks better of it. He stands up and slumps out. Life as he knew it at Pellit Chemicals is clearly over. Thank God it's Friday, right, Dale? Let's drill this patient and then you can drill me. You continue to surprise me, you weird little man. Julia quickly undoes the patient's belt and yanks his pants down. You like that? This getting you hot? (in a puppet voice) `I wish I was Dale's weenie so I could have sex with Julia.' Suddenly, the patient bursts out LAUGHING and sits up. What the hell?! The patient pulls off his nitrous mask to reveal it's KENNY, the guys' former classmate from the bar. What is this? Seriously? This is all you've got? Your word against mine? I'm a highly respected professional and you're two losers. You little bastard -- OUT! GET OUT!
