Yeah, I'm just thinking about what I want. I want a divorce. Creme Brulee. I'm gonna getcha! I'm gonna  getcha! She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with  delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the nearby console. Jessica picks it up: It's okay, my fault. Alright, kiddo, it's getting late, let's get you to bed before your parents get home. Don't give me the puppy eyes, you little maniac. Go brush your teeth! Molly GIGGLES, RUNS upstairs. Once Molly's gone, Jessica looks at the photo. She eyes Cal affectionately. I don't care. I love him and given the opportunity, I'd have his babies. Her best friend, LIZ (29), LAUGHS. Seriously? Conan O'Brien? You'd do Conan O'Brien? I'm just saying, Richard's a lot  of things: successful, smart... Boring, workaholic, sexually  repressed... But he's not very funny, that's  all. Yeah, well, you want funny, go watch `Cosby' reruns. You want a good lay, go get yourself some of... that. She motions off to the side. What? The hot piece that's been checking you out for the last hour. THE CROWD PARTS, revealing: JACOB PALMER (32). The  smoothest, coolest son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen. He tilts his glass at them, toasting. Aren't you going to say anything? Nothing. Almost twenty-five years of marriage, you have nothing to say? She looks at him. He turns to her, about to say something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward. It's silent. Devastating. Hey, your sister's asleep, just checking you're alive -- She SCREAMS as -- I'm sorry, Robbie! I didn't see  anything, I swear. I don't know, Hannah. Your life is just so... PG-13.  Hannah's mouth drops open. My life is not PG-13! It so is. You've never left LA.  You pass the bar you're gonna be, what, a patent lawyer, probably married to that snooze-fest Richard. I just worry about you is all. Hell, you've resorted to fantasizing about Conan `Ginger-  Dick' O'Brien. He's funny. He looks like a carrot, honey. Hannah LAUGHS. Hi. Conan O'Brien. My friend Hannah thinks he's sexy. You didn't really just say that. How old are you? Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work. Jacob sits down at their table, uninvited. I don't. Yes, she does. You've got to be kiddi-- Is that so? Multiple times. What do you expect me to say to that? Wow. She STANDS, grabs her coat and Liz's hand. Okay, time to go. Liz doesn't move. I'll go home with you, you can call me Hannah, I don't give a Liz! (whispering to him) Another time, maybe. GIGGLING, the girls leave the bar. I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not to be. We've been married so long, somewhere we became... stagnant, you know? He keeps staring straight ahead. Okay, you're not talking and you  know that only makes me talk more.  Maybe that's good, maybe that's  good. Okay... We've been spending time together.  Lunches, meetings, that kind of  stuff...  Silence. She closes her eyes tightly. I slept with him. Kind of.  Tracy opens one eye, taking a peek. Nothing. No, no kind of. I can't believe I  said kind of. That's just not  something you do in a kind of way.  I slept with someone. There. I  said it. I slept with someone.  Oh God. It's the worst thing I've  ever done but it feels so good to  say out loud. I slept with  someone. I SLEPT with someone. I  slept with SOMEONE. I slept with  ... please stop me, please say  something.  No reaction. David Jacobowitz. From work. You met him at the Christmas party.  You remember that party? They had  the giant paper-machï¿½ wreath? I  kept asking the decorator how he  made it? You wore that sweater --  Finally, Cal speaks -- The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal -- But the fact that I did, that it  could happen at all, I think it  just shows how broken we are and -- Are you out of your mind!? He looks up at her, pleading. Okay. I should have knocked. Robbie! Stop it! Listen, Robbie -- Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver. How was dinner... Oh my God, Mr. Weaver, you're bleeding. Why are you bleeding? Cal! Cal! Uh-huh. Yeah. You're bleeding real bad, Mr. Weaver. She goes to touch his eye. Out of nowhere... he starts BANGING THE SHIT out of his steering wheel. It's okay. Jessica reaches for the door, but stops. She takes a deep breath, adorable. Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years. You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile. You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well... then I think she's batshit crazy. Cal smiles, distracted but grateful. In fact -- and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- I think I've even developed a Uh-huh. What? I'm sorry to hear that. So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2  is a lot like unit 1 except you're  downstairs so... the ground is  closer. Which is nice. Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys  here. You'll fit right in.  Cal SIGHS, un-enthused. Ooh, the gym has an elliptical  machine... I assume you want to  get back in shape?  Cal looks down, embarrassed. Great! I'll let you know when  they fix it. I just wanted to say that...  Her voice cracks. She turns away. Shit.  She gathers herself. Cal steps forward. Instinct tells  him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops  himself. She realizes this. There's something harsh and  complicated about the reality of it all.  Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to  lighten things. Do you want me to back that thing  out of the driveway for you? You have trouble in reverse is  all. Three if you count my father's  foot. I knew it.  They smile, in rhythm for a moment. Then they realize,  stop smiling. Cal turns awkwardly. I think I'm have a mid-life crisis  maybe. Can women have mid-life  crisis? In the movies it's always men  having them and buying ridiculous  yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man  and I really don't want a yellow We got married so young, Cal. And  I'm forty-one. And that's so much  older than I thought I'd be. And I got really upset with an  umpire at Molly's t-ball game last  month -- like really upset, like I  screamed at him and wished he  would die -- and I started feeling  like the person I promised I  wouldn't turn into, you know? And we haven't been us, not for a  long time. And I don't know when  you and I stopped being `us'  but... I mean, do you?  Cal finally turns and looks at her. Don't you love us anymore? Cal takes Molly's face in his hands, starts tearing up. TROY! The place is... nice, Mr. Weaver. That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a  difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before... Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder. It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off. I know, Robbie. An awkward beat, then. Jesus Christ. Is it racist that I can't tell them apart? Liz nods her head "yes" at Hannah. Hannah stifles a LAUGH. Liz stands. Well, Richard: thank you for inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye' party. The conversation has been riveting, like stepping back in  time. Before I go, a toast. She holds up her glass, toasting. Sweetie: go into your hole and  study your cute little ass off for that bar exam. We'll see you when you emerge. Yeah, okay. I'll walk you out. Before they clear... Richard, you just give me a heads- up so I can get really drunk before-hand, okay? Did you hear that? `It's going to be a special night.' You think he's going to propose? At the Cheesecake Factory? Oh God, I hope not. Why? Do you really want him to? Hannah SHRUGS. He's nice. Yeah, well... Jesus. Really?  (with a shrug) Okay. Not my life, I love you, call me if you need anything.  Liz KISSES her goodbye, EXITS. Hannah looks at her  table. Everyone is typing on their BLACKBERRIES.  She SIGHS, heads to rejoin them. Yes, sir. Thanks. I don't know. Wow. Yeah, probably. Hi. Amy Johnson. Cal extends his hand. Does it really matter? And that's when I started writing the column for LA Weekly. God,  how long have I been talking? Jacob takes her hand. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, David. I'm just a little  swamped right now so...  He closes the door behind him. No, I haven't. I ran track in high school. Thank you. No, I do -- David, you've been a great friend  to me. And you were the first man  in a very long time to make me  feel... noticed, I guess? What  happened between us that night...  it meant something to me. You  weren't the only one excited to  come to work lately.  David smiles. But now, when I see you, all I see  is his face. All I see when I  look at you is what I did to my  marriage.  She's losing it, wipes her eyes. You see this? I'm saving you from  disaster, David, `cause you're  asking to pre-board the Titanic.  Honestly, do you really want any  part of this?  Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone. (calling back in) Yes, of course. Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again. She closes the door behind her, looks to Robbie. Seriously? It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I have to get back to work. They walk out together. They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh? Robbie NODS. You'd really think someone would have written something better by now. Robbie LAUGHS, the tension broken a bit. Guess I should take it down, huh? How is he? I've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but... how is he, really? Robbie hesitates. Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me, I'm almost done here. She turns back to her work. After a beat: Oh. Well, good. That's... really good. (then, covering) We'll get take-out for dinner tonight, okay? Think about what you're in the mood for. Robbie hesitates, then adds: Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad, too. You do? Oh God, baby, you're so much like  me it's scary. You wound up with  all my stuff, Robbie. I'm so  sorry. It's my fault, what happened with  your father. It's grown-up stuff  that I can't talk about but... it's my fault. Not his. So just... be good to him, okay? You promise? He NODS, the most soulful thirteen-year-old ever. David, this is my son, Robbie. Robbie, this is David. We work together. Robbie takes him in, shakes his hand. I'll be right back, okay, honey? You ready to go? Really, thank you but it's okay. Yes, I can but... I'm, uh, five years sober so... Cal's face drops. The WAITRESS approaches. So... what do you do, Cal? I asked you first. Seriously, what do you do? I'm a teacher. Now, c'mon: what do you do? Cal NODS, exaggerated. I'm sorry, are you not going to tell me what you do? He's still nodding, as if fascinated. I should get back to my friends --  Kate STANDS. Cal puts his face in his hands. What were you supposed to tell me? You think I'm a perfect combination of sexy and cute? Cal looks up. Wow, an actual honest man. I don't know what to do with that. It's kind of... rare around here. It's nice, actually. You have no idea. I'm kind of a magnet for these jerk-offs. They charm me, and I fall for it, and at some point they just... never call me again. So... what were you `supposed' to do next? Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens? Cal looks up, surprised. He clears his throat, then: Ask me again. Cal smiles and leans forward, faux-confident. More, tell me more. What do you want to do with me? Oh, I almost forgot -- heard some good gossip at the nail salon. It's about Cal. Apparently, Mr. Weaver has become quite a man-about-town if you get my drift. What? Lots of young women coming in and  out of his apartment lately. It's good for Jess to know. She still baby-sits for him after all. Well, it's good gossip at the least. Ooh, guess what else I heard... As she CONTINUES CHATTERING in the b.g., we HOLD ON Jessica. Thinking. Madison! Madison, wait! Madison stops walking, but not texting. Hey, I had a question -- Madison holds up a finger ("one second") and continues texting. Finally, she stops. Looks up. Smiles. Hey, Jessica, whassup? I had a question for you, Madison. It's kind of on the personal side so... My lips are... Madison extends her arms, begins clapping and making WEIRD NOISES. Jessica stares at her blankly. Seals. My lips are seals. Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the thing... I don't mean to be blunt or insulting but, let's call it what it is: you're always sleeping with older guys, right? Always. Lots of college guys, I've heard. Lots of them. Even rumors about a few teachers. Totally. So my question is: how do you do that? I mean, how do you get them not to see you as... well, a kid in high school? Oh, well first off, I have a huge  rack. You do, yes. So that helps. Yes, I'm sure it does. You don't have a huge rack. No, I don't unfortunately. So that's not gonna work. Nope. Madison SIGHS. Okay, here's what you do. Wait, how old is he? Old. Like really old? Like parent old. Nasty. Rock on, Jessica. Thank you, Madison. Alright, you have to hook him. Force his hand. Make him unable to stop himself from doing what he knows to be wrong. How? Do what I do. Send him a postcard  from downtown. Huh? Go TMZ on his ass. I'm not following you, Madis-- The full gyno.  Off Jessica's blank look. A crotch shot? A nip slip? Jesus, Madison! Well, you came to me for advice, that's my advice. You put those across his radar, he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure. Madison walks off, calls back. Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though. He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site. And  then your brother sees it, tells  your mom, and suddenly you're not  allowed to use Facebook for a  month. Thanks, Kevin!  She leaves Jessica there, processing the advice. Robbie, get down! Robbie Weaver! I am your baby- sitter and I'm telling you to GET What the hell are you thinking? This has to stop, Robbie. Seriously. I won't. BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!! I've been spending time with him for a while. Robbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual. He's older. I don't want my parents to know. And with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the cutest thing you've ever seen. It doesn't matter. I don't know. Yes, kind of. I know. But this all has to stop now, Robbie. The speeches, the texts, all of it. It's very sweet, but it has to stop. He just sits there, lost. I'll see you around, okay? She EXITS. Robbie remains seated on the grass. Devastated. His three friends approach. You look great, Cal. Well you look great. Really. Cal smiles. Me, too. She sound okay to you? Mrs. Thompson. This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on. Cal smiles. Yeah. I kind of like him, though. Me, too. They LAUGH. God, these two are great together when they're in rhythm. The laughter trickles away. An awkward beat, then: Oh... it's not. You seeing anyone? Oh. Because you hear things, you know. I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer. He smiles, emboldened. He's a very strange boy, isn't he? I missed you, too. Cal takes her hand, kisses it. Cal? What are you doing here? You two know each other? We've met before? Seriously? Oh, so now she's your WIFE again? YES, WHY DON'T WE!? I'm sorry, I'm playing catch-up: how do you two know each other? Maybe your husband should tell you. Cal hesitates. Ha! Yes, let's do that. Let's focus on Robbie. Kate goes to her blackboard. As you know, Robbie's shining moment this year was when he set a school record for cursing in an eighth grade English class. She writes on the board: ASSHOLE. She underlines it. Asshole. Are you familiar with this word, Mrs. Weaver? Asshole: as in, someone who tells a woman that he'll call, and never does. Asshole: as in, someone who uses `honesty' to get a woman into bed with him, but is actually full of shit like the rest of them. Asshole: as in, someone who allows a woman to go down on him for forty-five minutes because he's `nervous' -- Leave me alone, Cal! I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you (fumbling for keys) I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you. I can't do this now, Cal. Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute, I'm going home. She opens the car door. I don't even know who you are. Tracy gets in her car and speeds off. No, that's great. I just... (then, privately) I'm sorry, I thought... I thought you were about to propose. The room goes quiet, trying to hear. No, I just... it's fine. I'm sorry, I just got thrown is all. Richard pulls Hannah off to the side. No, no, don't be silly, it's fine. No, I know... Wait -- you're figuring out how you feel about us? She LAUGHS. Once. Then twice. Loudly. Everyone's now watching. Liz gets a good seat, excited. You know what the best part is: I would have said yes! To YOU! And I didn't even want you to propose! Just now, I swear to God: I was hoping you wouldn't propose. And I still would have said YES! That's how pathetic I am! She snags someone else's drink from the table, DOWNS IT. She grabs Richard's cheeks. I will consider your job offer, thank you so much, Richard. Hysterically LAUGHING, she walks away. As she passes, Liz sticks out her hand and they slap five. And you know what she said? Do you remember me? Do you still think I'm attractive? Do you still want to take me home? Let's go. She leads him out of the bar. We STAY WITH the WOMEN Jacob had just been introducing himself to. Slut. This place looks like something out of a men's magazine. I'm not sure. Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones. I like this song. Yes, please. Jacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. Brings them (and the bottle) over towards the couch. He pats the couch. Hannah nods, walks over, sits down. Cheers. They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She  holds out her glass for a refill. Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes choking... So is this how it normally works? How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink? And then you sleep with them? So that's what happens next? We sleep together? I'm very nervous. I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic. Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS. No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here! I'm here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me. I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up. Okay, okay, this is happening. Take off your shirt. I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off. He's ripped. Holy crap. She pokes a finger at his abs. It's like you're photo-shopped. No way! Not with all that happening... She motions casually at his abs. So... do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom? Good. Let's go there. This pillow is amazing. It forms perfectly to the shape of my head. Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone? Off his look... They are, aren't they!? I always wondered who actually buys them! You do! The hot guy from the bar buys them! Of course! She shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself. Sorry, let's proceed. Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her... she pulls back again. You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you? Oh. My. God! You totally do! How much did it cost? What? No! I don't want to know anything about you. Okay, fine, but then we bang. What's your mom like? And your father? And time for stuff like that? He LAUGHS. David, stop. Look, I had a nice  time, which is a substantial  upgrade from the rest of the...  times I've been having lately.  So, I don't think I'm ready to  start dating but my ex clearly is  and there's a yogurt shop where  they make this eight calorie ice  cream that tastes like a laxative,  so if you'd like to take me there  sometime I guess I wouldn't say  no. Hello. Oh, Jessica. Hi. Sorry.  Jessica, this is my work-friend. He's an accountant named David.  David, this is my baby-sitter,  Jessica. Okay, David, well  everything sounds great.  Spreadsheets.  David smiles knowingly. So... How was dinner? It was just for work. Oh, thanks.  Tracy reaches for her purse, awkwardly. So how much do I owe yo-- Did you know your kids are the  only ones I baby-sit for who  always want to stay awake so they  can see their dad when he gets  home. I mean, they fight with  everything they have to keep their  eyes open so they can hear what  Dad had for dinner, or how he  liked the movie. Lot of kids want  to stay awake for Mom -- and your  kids always want to see you, don't  get me wrong -- but not a lot wait  up for Dad. Maybe it's because  he's good, and he's kind, and he's  decent. What are you talking abo-- Batshit crazy.  She walks out the door. Tracy looks confused. Jessica?  Jessica turns, explodes? I DON'T WANT YOUR SLUTTY MONEY! Jessica!  But she's gone. Tracy SIGHS ("what the hell was that")  and CLOSES the door. Hi, Cal.  Silence. Cal is looking at her inside. She has no idea. So... I'm in the basement. I'm  trying to get the water heater  working `cause the pilot's out and  I don't know how to relight it.  Obviously Cal sees she's not in the basement. I'm sorry to bother you, I just...  what do I do?  Cal lowers the phone, looks at her, hesitates. Then: Yeah. Okay, it's down. I got it. Oh, there it goes! Well, thanks, Cal. I...  appreciate your help. Yeah. And... thanks again.  Cal HANGS up. He takes one final look back at his wife  as the sprinklers go off in the backyard and douse him. (not looking up) High School Musical. No! NOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOO! (free at last) Thank you. Cal KISSES her, jumps up from the couch. No!!!! She jumps, but it's too late. Daddy? Bernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY. Baby! What are you wearing!? What is this? What is he doing? Can I take these off, please? Cal: are you seriously doing this  in front of the kids? Well, might as well wait for your  daughter. No, your other daughter.  Huh? Just then: Hi, Daddy. WTF! And right behind her... JACOB. Holding a bottle of  wine and smiling like an idiot. Everyone freezes. Wait, you two know each other? Hi, Nanna. Hey, Robbie. Hey, Nanna. Hey, cutie. It's me, I couldn't pronounce Hannah when I was little -- wait, so how do you know my dad? Dad, this is my boyfriend, Jacob. I want to see the boyfriend! So you two, like, really know each other? Daddy!!! DAD! (down to two scarves) Will someone please take this goddamn thing off me! Daddy, no! Daddy! Daddy! Jacob! Daddy, stop! This breaks Bernie's trance. He hesitates. He didn't do anything. He doesn't even know. Robbie, please get this off me! He doesn't even know that I'm in love with him! Robbie stops, turns. (pointing at Cal) With him. Who is she pointing at!? He doesn't even know about the dirty pictures I made for him. Who are you? Jacob! Thank you, Officer.  He nods, walks to the door. Stops there. I'm so sorry -- (under her breath)  Oh, that's ironic.  Cal whips around. Dad, c'mon, I'm not going to stop seeing him. Cal turns away. Cal, stop being unreasona-- IT'S NOT YOUR HOUSE ANYMORE, CAL! Goodbye, Nanna. Goodbye, cutie. They EXIT. Cal lets them go, then grabs his things. Nice.  Before he goes, Cal stops in front of Robbie. Our next speaker is not only the class salutatorian, but he's also one of the most... Spirited... young men, I've ever had the pleasure of teaching. Ladies and gentlemen: Robbie Weaver. Robbie takes the stage to APPLAUSE. This is not the same  kid we've come to love. There's something different in  his face. He's been broken. He spots JESSICA. Daddy.  He smiles at her, adoring. I wouldn't have missed it. Awkward. Strained. I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna  head up there early. Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while. Wait: I thought you weren't  giving up. It's a good plan. She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse. Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school. She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of envelope she once used for... Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses him, sweetly, on the cheek. You take care, Robbie. Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps  up next to his son. You gave a good eighth grade  graduation speech. Do you think we can ever come back  from all this, Cal? Things are just so messed up. And  it's been such a strange year.  I've been in such a strange place.  And we have all these problems, so  many problems I've lost count, but  at the end of the day, I mean, the  only thing I know --  She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply: I am just so glad you took me for  that ice cream.  Cal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then: It was rocky road by the way.
