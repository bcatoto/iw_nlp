I don't think I can keep this. If I didn't care, maybe I'd be able to stand to watch you do this. Stop. You think I don't know what you do all day? I've loved you. I know the good stuff, and I know the shit. You're the one living it. Don't think I don't know it's worse for you. Don't you dare try that shit on me! I see where it's going. You'll lose your apartment. And then what? You'll move in with me-- --And then it'll go on this way, and I'll rag on you, and finally boot you out -- and then what? I mean, have you run the film? You know what...? I'd have had you move in anyway... if... If it was me you wanted. And not Melissa. I have to get back. I got it. Yeah. I'll have my own assistant. You believe that? Yeah, thanks. I do. Oh, please. --Oh, please, you think professional women mentor one another? You think there's some mutually supportive empathetic touch-feely network of kindly pie- bakers? --Those bitches hate each other! Quick, who was the worst boss you ever had? A woman, right?! We can't delegate, we can't command -- I mean, there's a reason we're not generals--! Look, enough, okay--? Steve handles the rents. So feed your fucking bullshit to him. --Like the rent's not low enough--! You could be a bike messenger and come up with that! --Look, I'm just telling you, he's been talking about calling these people he knows from the club to muscle you out -- I've told him not to do that, but he's really pissed. W-What? Look, that's none of your- How do you know I'm in school! Are you some kind of creep? Have you been following me?! You can only see a corner of it. How did you know? Well, who asked y- Eddie. You were there? God. This is all so weird... No, no, no, Eddie, I know that. I wish I was more surprised. He was... involved in some stuff... I better not say any more. Eddie, I've got to do the funeral. And God knows what else. I just... we can't meet, okay? No. I don't want that - please don't... I'll call you at some point, when this is over. Okay? Okay. --is prosaic. Yes. I... Listen, return my call, Mr. Morgan, this article's about you's gonna get written with or without your cooperation... (BEEP!) All my new friends. Carl Van Loon wants to meet you? But you're not in the finance game. What can you do for Carl Van Loon? (shaking her head, Since when do you speak... what happened to you? God, Eddie -- I felt so bad about that. You didn't do all this for me. All right, all right -- boy, you are really begging for it. "I'm proud of you." I'm actually... more than proud. I'm a little... ... intimidated. What are you doing, hon? What, you think somebody's watching? Is there anything you want to tell me, Eddie? Now's the time. Old Chinese proverb? You should sleep. Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow? What. What. Are you all right? When was the last time you ate something? ... found dead in her hotel room last night, victim of foul play. An unidentified eyewitness has reported seeing a man with a limp leaving the scene.ANCHORWOMAN Anyone with information should contact local law enforcement authorities. --Steve? Hi, Eddie... it's Melissa. Listen, call me back as soon as you-- (surprised he picked up) Eddie--? We're talking now. You can't see me, Eddie. Who is this? Look... my husband died three days ago. Don't tell me I look good, because I know I don't. I didn't want you to see me this way... You look good. Yeah, well, MDT'll do that to you. I know you've been doing it. I just read the Post. Eddie. Short-selling stocks? Second-guessing the markets? You? Come on. These days, the Post's about all I can read. I mean, I did it too. And I only took nine or ten hits. Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he? Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug...MELISSA I was like, down the hatch. And it was amazing. I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes and understood it. My work rate increased... just, insanely, overnight. My boss started to hate me -- they offered me his job. And then I got scared. I'm not stupid. I mean, nobody can keep up that level of mental activity and not crash. I stopped taking it. I got sick. Headaches, throwing up... I went back to Vernon to see if I maybe shouldn't take another hit, or half a hit, and then he told me about... about the people who were dying. One guy didn't die, but he's a vegetable, his mother has to sponge him down every day... How much have you been taking, Eddie? Well, maybe they've worked out the bugs. Maybe... maybe this isn't the same batch... You're off it right now, aren't you? Are you getting a headache? Well, I didn't take more. And I didn't die. But after a while I found I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes. I missed deadlines. I got lazy... and slow... put on weight... the magazine let me go. My husband checked out. Sex? Get out of here. That was two years ago, and I haven't been the same since. I can't read any more -- I mean, the fucking New York Post? After this, I'm going to have a migraine for three days. And I've got to pee. Which is another thing. You have some left? Good. Go home and take it. Take the dose down, but don't just stop -- you'll die if you just stop. Try to taper off. Otherwise, the headache's just the beginning... I have to go-- I don't know. I have to go-- I don't know-- Goodbye, Eddie. Lindy...? I wouldn't have let him in, but I know you know him... It's all right, Lisa. Eddie-- What is it--? Okay. Okay, I'll get you to a What kind of pills? What headaches? What are you--? (beat, realizing) Are you on some drug? Oh. Oh. So all this energy of yours, all this focus... has been some drug, Eddie? You need a doctor. What the hell are you doing up there? Are you tearing up your floor or something?! ...a smart drug...? Oh, Eddie... you jerk. (knows what's coming) No. And I'm supposed to just GO?! In the middle of my work day?! To your APARTMENT to get you more DRUGS? You did--? Why?! Then where did you keep it--? Oh, you prick. You asshole... in my fucking Yes. --Eddie, there's someone following me. He got into the cab behind me, and they're making every turn I'm making! What the fuck did you put me in the middle of--?! There's traffic. We're slowing down... (to the driver) Go around him! Go around! Shit! We're stopped dead. He's getting out, Eddie -- he's walking over here- Help! Help!! There's... a... man... chasing me. He has a long, tan -- Are you still there? I'm hiding, but I'm stuck. He'll find me! He killed a cop-- He's going to kill me, Eddie! You fucking asshole-- Not yet. --I don't know what to do! What do I do--! What?! S-swallow one of those things?! He's got a knife -- I can't think my way out of a knife--! Yes. He's getting closer. Eddie...? I feel it. Who's back, Eddie? That was never what I wanted. You know... you were always smart. You could have done this. Not this... but some of these things... maybe a third of these things... without any smart drug at all. A third of all this... to most people...? ...would be plenty. I understand that stuff now, Eddie. And I don't blame you for taking it. No one could ever tell you, till you take it, what it can do. Invincibility in a bottle. And I know I'm going to think about taking it again every day for the rest of my life. But once you can see everything that way, mapped out like that, on a grid... and always be right...? Who'd want to wing it? Who'd want to fuck up? Who'd want to be human? I just came up to say goodbye. I don't ever want to see you again. I'm not even going to stay in New York. Don't try to find me, and don't try to help me. Mr. Morgan...? I need you to change your jacket. ...And the Dow has been yo-yoing all day, amidst speculation that Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...
