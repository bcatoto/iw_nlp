What? Did he go somewhere? This is so nice. You know what? I'm going to have that too. Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder there's a crowd. What? He's nice to look at. You know, open-wheeled and all. Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've got enough to do here. Mater's going to have a blast though. (off McQueen's silence) You're bringing Mater, right? You never bring him to any of your races. Just let him sit in the pits, give him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a thrill of a lifetime for him. A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator. I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I have a message from London. It appears to be a standard television camera. They said if you could get closer photos next time, that would be great. Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil platforms you were on? Turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world. They'd been scrambling everyone's satellites. The Americans actually discovered it just before you did. They placed an agent on that platform, under deep cover. He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation. No, not yet. The American is here tonight to pass it to you. He'll signal you when he's ready. What is it? What, me? No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm in Diagnostics. I'm not a field agent. Oh, you've got to be joking. He's in the loo. I can't just go into the men's loo. Hello. A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator. Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station Yeah. Okay, I get it--- Listen! We should find somewhere more private. You're right. Impossible to know which areas here are compromised. So, when can I see you again? Got it. We'll rendezvous then. Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed. But why hasn't he contacted us yet? Right, of course. He'll signal us when he can. Hold on. I think I've got something. The Pacer from the party last night. Cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks... Yep. His VIN numbers match. Conducting analysis on the target. He's not the only one here. Three... five... they're everywhere. And they're all closing in on... oh no. Finn? Finn, where are you? I'm trying. Get out now! I've got him in the back alleys east of the garages. Multiple assailants are closing in quickly. Come on! Get in here! I hope that device didn't fall off. Still in one piece, great. Downloading the photo now. Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell. (to Mater, expectantly) What is this? Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is this, Mater? But you're the one who took it. Oh, right. Yes, of course. "A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed." Sorry. It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period. At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine. Yes, alright. Thank you. Just pay attention. Rare parts. Exactly! Really? Me too. No VIN scans. Got it. Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir. But I thought --- Informant? Alright, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old. So. There you go, informant. Inform us. To whom? Right. Let's see. There were Hugos. And Trunkovs. Finn. Everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars. Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans. Thank you. I think. Hang on a minute. Hold still. Thank you, Finn. Whoever find a friend, find a treasure. Now, mangia! Eat! That should just about do it. So Mater, it's voice-activated. But you know, everything's voice- activated these days. Now hold still. I have to do the final fitting on your disguise. Oh dear. That's no good. The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto. I was. Your dents are valuable? So you were being serious in Paris? McQueen isn't just part of your cover? It's okay. Say no more. I'll work around the dent. Scusatemi, tutti! Signori! Mio nonno, my grandfather, has broken down. If one of you would help I would be so thankful. No, no, don't fight over me. Signore Tow Truck, per favore? Why aren't you in disguise? Come on, there's no time. Go! He's in. (cutting in to his (already on it) I'm trying... It's too sophisticated! (analyzing the data) I'm working on it. I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse. Finn, it's the camera! On the tower. Finn. Mater. Abort the mission. They've got Finn. Get out of there. Get out of there right now! Finn, he's not joking. You just need to focus on the race. Mater would want you to race. Mater! Go and get some more dents, Mater. So we'll be "okay"? Really? Time. That's it! Trying to turn back time. If I can just reverse the polarity... Oh no! Done. They're standard issue now. Oh no. That's Mater's. We're here because of you, Mater. Got it! Mater, stop! Oh no. Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you. Say it! He was getting on my nerves. Who's winning the race? Back up! Back away! It's Lightning McQueen! Get back! - Bomb! - It's a bomb! - Everybody down! - Look out! O-kay... But Sir Axlerod created the race, Mater. Why would he want to hurt anyone? One moment. I'd like to see where this is going. Mater! It's a perfect match! I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater." That's a very entertaining story, young man. No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit far-fetched. Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see you again. I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so nice to meet you all. Van! Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable. A "valuable" dent? Oh, she's as crazy as Mater. Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline. And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode. Why, thank you --- So he's not so good-looking. I'm serious. You don't need it! And those open wheels. Finn, time to go. Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly. We know. Don't forget massively charming. That's alright, we understand. But I'll be back. You still owe me that first date.
