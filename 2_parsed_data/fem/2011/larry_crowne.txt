Too much mac & cheese for this little pickle bug! Mr. Raphael is no longer with the bank. How can I help you? You're carrying what on the house? Two Ninety-two K. That's trouble. Three years ago I'd have loaned you $700,000, but I think you read the papers. It is Friday, Mr. Crowne... Maybe he was out on a date. Don't even think about lighting that up in my house. Whole box of Cha-Cha records from the Fifties. You don't have any of these, I promise. No! UniMart just lost my business forever! Sorry, Lie-bare-eye-bee. Get a better job somewhere so you can crush them. Listen to my husband. Hasn't called a man boss in years. Paid off the house. Picked 8 little numbers when I kept saying he was a fool. A quarter million dollars later I've shut up. I'm here. Shut up. Turn off! Are you new to the Faculty? This is the Faculty Lot. We've earned degrees for these spaces. Students park on Mars. I bet it won't be the first time. This is it? This class...is CANCELLED!! While earning a Masters in Shakespearean Political Discourse from Vassar, I learned to care. Caring is a prerequisite for this class I have to teach in this Who are you? Why are you here, Steve? Busik. Of course... Your next wife might stand smoking that pipe in the house but your first one says 'uh-uh!' On the old TV on "Wheel of Fortune" (A person). Larry Crowne, been thinking about you. Sit down here... That's going to be you someday. You have money in all those records. If you can part with them, they'd go for something on the eBay. I'll show you how... Gonna be a long night with you two. You'd think so. Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water Torture. And Speech at Sunrise Why wouldn't I believe you? You were looking at porn. Yes you are. I have no secrets from you. I share the whole miserable slate. You look at Bra-Busters Triple-X expecting me to pretend I don't know or I don't care. I do both and don't like it. Where'd you get the Hot Wheels? That machine's a classic. You're in Matsutani's Econ with me. That class is straining my coconut. Didn't know you scooted. (pulls out mobile phone) Give me your number. I'll introduce you to like-minded enthusiasts. Name please? 'Larry'? I don't think so. I used to be Kathleen but one day I looked in the mirror and saw a girl named Talia. (then in her phone) Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check your texts and we'll do us some scooting. Gotta tell you, Lance. Tucking a polo shirt into khakis makes you look like a cop. I know! Gotta change that... Then get going!! We now all know how to Burpie. Thank you. Who's next? Ms. Crowne? Mr. Crowne. My bad. M classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all I had to teach them. Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one. Now look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound for jail. Mack. Treating college like another tour of combat. Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5. The part that is always cut. (still talking to herself) Great. The history of the sugar maple tree now. Thank you Wikipedia. But the speech is over. MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Ah-ooo-gah! Time's up. Breakfast may never be ready. Are you clairvoyant? Hey Monkey! This is Lance Corona. Classmate and good guy, so far. Snap along, Lance or you can't join the gang. Stan knows engines and junk. We ride, Monkey! If it was Saturday we'd look for yard sales. Lead the way. Monkey! Lance knows a yard sale! You have any old clothes? Layer this... with this. Add this belt? I LOVE THIS! Where did you GET IT? Reeled it in like tuna from the Atlantic. Diamonds in a diamond mine. Take this... under this...unbutton that. You and I are going to spend some time together! I gotta see Chez Lance. No sign of a woman around here for years. Drape a scarf over that lamp and you'll soften the light. No TV, b t vinyl disks of music? You trying to seduce me? Alphabetical order. No artistic chaos for you. Spin this platter, Mr. DJ? Breakfast nookie! Did Denise make you breakfast in here with a little apron and lipstick perfectly applied? Patience thought she was stuck up and seriously fleeced you. So what happened there, my Lance? She must have been pretty. Fair haired or dark? Like me. So? How about a demonstration? he means 'of the kitchen'. Larry's game... Kitchen, Monkey! Lance made all this. You should have seen him. He was like... That Denise. What a fool. You a e way cooler than you appear. Act I: Inventory. What do you sell? Act Two? To Market. Reach your buyers. Act Three? Three legs of accounting. Receivable. Payable. Due. Act Four? Forward planning. Plan to grow. Act Five? Final Profitability. What do you clear on bottom-line? In other words: "To be or not to be... in Business." Did you notice? No script. No notes. So it can be done. You did good, Fran. Thanks. Anything for the woman who brought out the public speaker in Frances Taylor-Briegh. I used you as a Focal Reference but you weren't there for me. What's wrong, Mercy? I broke up with the Orthodontist. Now I have to get a new boyfriend and a new orthodontist. You ever do that? Get crushes on people you see every day after ignoring them and then find out they're creeps after all? Mr Crowne? Can you move along Super. Ethel's here, Lucy. What's going on? When was the last time you looked at your life and saw nothing but fraud and desperation? Mercy. You're an idol to me. Hearing you talk like that is crushing my dreams. Well I'm joking of course!!! Translation? Ms. Francesco? Something complicated. You ready? Re-invention Big Boy I started in the smallest unit. No one should ever buy clothes off the internet. You have to feel the fabric and test the drape... A lot to me. Try these on. Anywhere. Fashion is no place for modesty. Strip. This is a service to humankind, Lance. It hurts me to see a Top Cat dressed like an ex-hockey player. You gotta look gorgeous from shoe to collar. Starting now. Lance! My boyfriend's here! Put your pants on! Go to hell... It was. Yes. How? Okay. This is Denise. How can I help you. My god. Larry Crowne. I remember you. Other than me being at work? I'm surprised is all. What do you want? Spit it, Lar. Okay. Okay. Yeah. How many months? That can't happen, Larry. I'm extended. I've put a deposit down on the first vacation I've had in 5 1/2 years. My expenses are as valid as yours, so I need the checks like always. A deal's a deal. That's not my problem. Take out a loan on the house or something. Oh, I'm not touching that. I don't want to open up the whole lawyer thing, but I will if pushed. Sucks, doesn't it? I appreciate the rigorous Crowne honesty, but this can't happen. These calls are monitored to guarantee customer satisfaction, so I'm hanging up before my supervisor comes on... Wait a ding dong minute. (counts the heads) 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Someone is missing! Who cut my class? Anyone know why? I don't believe this! Ditching me? He ditched me? Not okay. Larry Crowne, you are on my Shit List. Yes. Tell us more about your man dolls. Is that Larry Crowne!? You have a lot of nerve showing your face on campus after ditching my class! Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne. You'll lead off next assignment with three minutes on a personal first. A story, with details, not a laundry list or slide show. And, as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to hear about the first time you got laid. That woman is one clenched fist of fury. She must not be having any amok lovin'. Without a workout in the Inner Sanctum a few times a week I can't concentrate. You you want to fix it with your teacher? Bang her. You'd kill two birds in one bush. Nothing wrong with a campus romance. Otherwise life is what? Breakfast work, coffee, school, lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk, Mexican food, a movie, glass of wine or two then bed? That's not living. Bet she'd give you an A plus. If you're any good... More complimentary coffee? I drink it all day. So? You're back! Atta Baby! At East City. I see. (from the papers) Larry, this doesn't change anything. The interest alone will eat up your service industry salary. Okay. I will personally take this to my supervisor and fight to get you the loan you need. But you know how complimentary coffee is always lousy? Your chances are, too. Stop with the gloomy puss. You're doing everything right. Hang in there. You still have a friend at RiverBank. It's going to storm till next year. I do not scoot in the rain. My savior! Look at your new schmatas. And footwear! (hopping in, to Dell) Stay dry, sweetie! I never read them. Who did? I'm married to an ex- teacher turned blogger with two books in print. And oh, yes, he has the libido and internet access of a 13-year-old. I had a boyfriend who owned every movie Sophia Loren ever made. I d hear a DVD go into the playe an knew what I was going to be doing in a half-hour. Once more to Divorce Court to cashier a spouse, line my cloak with alimony and do myself homage. Othello. Act 1. Scene 1. Iago to Roderigo. Why can't all my students be like y u? Because, as I learned in your class, I am one of a kind. It happens. You are everything that's wrong with America, Larry Crowne! (talking to herself in the MOVIE A repackaged Larry Crowne won't fool me. Shame on you. Going after jail bait, you criminal. Insert Viagra joke here... herself at you... No. Don't let up. No, Mercy. NO MERCY! That was a memorable nugget. Mr. Koss to the lectern, please. Chef Corona! Steam us some corn bread? Woman on deck! I'm a friend of Lance's. Is he, Lance? Rah-ool. Rhymes with ya-cool. Are ya' cool, Raul? As boss, do you make up the menu? Is that a tough but fair job? Can Lance take a break? The artist formerly known as Larry. I need his expertise. Maurice says I'm saving his life by renting the space. You sure? You make it sound so simple!! I'm smiling... If they help, they help. "Chillax?" Did you use the word "chillax?" That come from your Bloggers Thesaurus? You lie to me, Dean. Every day. You. Lie. To. Me. I'm not complaining. I'm stating the truth. I teach while you pretend to work. Those weren't postings. They were comments. As soon as I saw you, I said, "I want to go out with that man." I said "Yes." You were there, remember? Yes you are. Disaster looms on most first dates, but I'm talking to you like you're a friend I want to make out with. Drive, asshole! Drive away! Drive straight til you hit a cliff on the coastline! LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER! Oh, chillax!!! I'm throwing rocks at my own car !! I loved these shoes once. Stupid shoes. Lance! Chick alert! You are not going to believe how Fate meets cute! No. Jesus Christ. And I've been calling you 'Lance'. And bust up your romp in the glen with Bambi? Hey. Bambi was a boy. Not me. I love riding in the night. Magic happens. What do men see in irritating free spirits? Seriously. I don't want one. I am walking, Crowne, as thoughts black boil up from my soul. Major consequences sure to follow. You'll read about them on Parsectwelve.com. I need a man flirting with me right now like I need a dog crapping on my lawn. I'm hoofing it. A man who notices shoes. All right. I'll be your Cycle Slut. It won't be a terrible thing if you kill us both. Are you really going to go this slow? Fine. I have time to window shop. Oh look, a sale on tires at AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox. I've never noticed their perfect design and colo scheme. This is so slow a cat could knock us over. Down to Portola and left to Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo. Right on Palermo till I yell stop. Try it and you'll flunk. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Put the shovel away and just get me home, 'kay? Measure his dick, officer! He's too diminutive to drive! Tiny dick loser! Best night I've had in years! Drive on, McDuff! Thanks for the ox-cart ride. Help me. Just hold my hand up to the numbers. I'll manage from there. Two two two two. Pound. Why I think it is! Take one step inside and I call security. This whole sorry chapter tonight. You passing up Gidget for a flat old coot like me. What, you have no short-term memory? Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant lands in the drunk tank while Goofus scoots me home. Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not see that? When we presume we make a pretty pair of asses of me and you or something like that. Why aren't you married? Help yourself. Do you have a crush on me? Single student. Unattainable teacher. It's common. You want to make out with me, you can. I know I'm not a third rate Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but I still Pretty dang good. I still got it, no? Whoever I am... Oh, come on! I left you all set up! What went down? Lance! A Betty on your Scooter after midnight? Holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel. Mr. Crowne? A moment please? I need a few moments alone with Mr. Crowne thank you. Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short a time span. I had no right to judge you or your relationships. Date who you want. I hope the entire thing will be forgotten. So there will be no bravado among you and your pals? Thank you, Mr. Crowne. Thanks for coming. I knew you'd be on the computer. Working... Are we making a mistake here? Point made. We could change things. We could start right now. Because we have history, Dean. But first, my thoughts... I've got to address drinking. I should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure. Really? Okay. Now, you. There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here. I'm not saying that. Here I have surprise topics. Friday, in a Lightning Round, you must wax on that topic for 2 minutes without pause, repetition, or lack of charm. No notes. One visual aid. Ms Pinedo Draw Spuds. Can't wait. Who is that? That's supposed to say 'Communism.' Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism. No idea. Just pick another. You digging what you see? I'm done w th college. Because I'm going into business. And don't drink and drive or do drugs and quit smoking and eat vegetables. I don't. I stopped. I did. I do. Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice gave us free tattoos. I wanted something in Japanese so check this out. That one says 'courage'. That one says 'spirit'. Courageous Spirit. Oh shut up. Be here for our Grand Opening! This place anonymous enough? As long as alcohol's out of my grasp. They have good pie, they say. Great. Sugar can replace tequila in my bloodstream, my thighs, and the folds in my neck. Yep. You'd think leggy blondes like us would be impervious, right? The mark of a restaurant is their Key Lime pie. No Key Lime? Boston Cream? Phooey. Peach. Peach pie. I'll have the French Toast. French Toast? (on the menu) Breakfast all day. I have seen it happen a time or two. I kissed a boy. When, third grade? One of my students. You Hoor. Gimme the friggin' details! He's not a minor is he? Older than me. Hugh Hefner in your class? What went down? He sort of... rescued me. And... he smelled nice. He a fireman who bakes bread? I wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did. Bold. Who is he? The student of yours!? This is Larry Crowne. It was fine, actually. I wanted to see if it was really you cooking back there. And say, howdy. Howdy doody. Absolutely. Yes indeed. No. Thanks. You kissed the cook... I got a whiff. He smelled like bell pepper. Look at the men in my life. Blame it on the booze... and collect yourself. You hoor... That's my problem. I'm a drunken hoor. Check please? What a difference from day one. I must be a better teacher than I thought. Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris stopped up-talking. Lala you can't shut up. Mack spoke about Australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice. And Larry Crowne... And... He's polite. Instead of fighting me off that night, what does he do but kisses me one and then all but tucks me in. What kind of guy does that to a loopy tramp like me? He could have ravaged me. I misread this guy and if I had a brain I'd find a way to steal him away from that cutie pie and keep him for myself. I wonder if he'd like that, if he would... What did I just say? What did I just say about Larry Crowne? I'm so sorry. Please go on. Congratulations all of you. Not me, I have to stay objective. A two-bedroom apartment and you don't have room for your furniture? There's Larry Crowne. Are you allowed to sit? Where does Perry get his coffee? You're probably wondering why I stopped by. Well, it's to tell you your grade for Speech 217. You killed on the final and have an A. Way to go! Class is out. Call me Mercedes. Or Mercy, for short. So. Just wanted to congratulate you. Your girlfriend will be thrilled. No. I meant the... never mind. Which classes are you going to ace next term? I hope you continue your education. Back at East City. You've made such a good start. I got Speech 217 moved to 10 AM, thank God. Who knows what I'll hear with the extra sleep. Should get going. You don't know anything about car devices, do you? Oh be quiet. It is Hellspawn. It was working fine. Then I think I pressed too many buttons. Seemed like years and years. Is Larry with you? I... Seeing you all... I just thought... Choose a seat and lets get started! Dr. M. Larry's enrolled? Larry said that about me? He is a good student Is there any chance you would consider having drinks with an older faculty peer who holds a PhD in Economics? Well, no. No offense Dr. M. News travels fast. Got it Turning right It is? That was a breeze. Thank you. I love that blouse with that skirt but I'd show more leg if I were you. I'm Mercy Tainot Bambi Romp in the Glen. Looking for Lance? 4225 Harbor? This is 4227. 4225. You'll see the stairs. Little higher heels'll get you wolf whistles. Did you tell Ed Matsutani taking my class changed your life? How?
