Hello. Hello? Hi! Martha? Yeah. Oh my god! Where are you? I'm not sure. Upstate I think. You're in New York? I think. Yeah. When did you get back? Martha? What's wrong? What's happened? I don't know. I should go back. Go back where? I have to go, I can't stay gone. No, no, no. Don't go. What are you talking about? Sorry for calling. Martha! Don't hang up. Please! Do not hang up. Do you want me to come get you? I can't wait that long. What do you mean? Tell me where you are and I'll come right now. It's okay, you don't have to- I want to see you Martha. Please. Martha! I'm fine. I just wanted to come into town. I wanted to walk. Yeah. Not right now. It's nice to see you. You too. What's going on? Not much. You alright? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. You were pretty upset on the phone. Sorry. I over reacted. To what? What happened? We had a fight. Who? Me and this guy. Who? Your boyfriend? Did he hurt you? No! Are you sure? No. I'm fine. Did you guys break up? How long were you together? A while. How long? I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or less. And you were here the whole time? You've been back in New York for over a year and you haven't called me? I'm sorry. Well, I'm glad you're here now. I made you some tea. Thanks. Ted should be up from the city soon. He'll cook us some dinner. I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go to bed? Of course. Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new tomorrow. She seems okay. Not much, she's pretty tired. She had some boyfriend, they were living in the Catskills. It's okay. It's fine. She's here now. I don't know. Martha? Why are you on the floor? I'm sorry. It's okay, you were in a deep sleep. Come have some breakfast. Hi. Yeah. How do you like the house? Well I love it. It's nice. I didn't know there was a lake. Yeah. Do you still like to swim? You don't live in the city anymore? We do. This is for weekends and holidays. Ted's finishing a new building down town and when it's done we're taking one of the new apartments. You want to see pictures? This is the view, the interiors are obviously not finished. It's nice right? 13. We were supposed to move in the spring but construction halted, so, it'll just be a little while longer. Okay, sorry, no more work talk. Aren't you hungry? Not really, sorry. It's okay, I can fix you something later. Where are we? Connecticut. How far are we? From what? Yesterday. You mean where I picked you up? About 3 hours. Why? Just wondered. Put out your cigarette. Why? Just do it. Is that him? Yeah. Hey! Hi! Great. You've got a really nice place here. I did. I know. I'm sorry. I will. She's been great, everyone's been great. Marcy was my grandmothers name. Sure. You coming? Martha! What are you doing? What? Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked. Why? You just can't. There are kids around and people come by. So? So you can't. We don't, just don't. I have a bathing suit you can borrow. Martha! I've been trying to wake you. You should get up or you won't sleep through the night. You should eat. I will. I'm just going to sleep a little more first okay? Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you before. It's okay. She's in a really deep sleep. I can't wake her. She's just really tired. She's had a bad breakup. I want to give her a couple days to get situated, you know? A pain in my ass, yes. Hey Max. Where do they go at night? I shouldn't. I'm not going to drink for awhile, I think it's a good idea for me. Patrick'll know. We switch off jobs each day so we all know how to do different things. Do you knit? No. I can learn though. It's okay, you'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family. We sell blankets in town. We still need some money, but when the farm's up and running we'll be self sufficient and we'll never have to worry about it again. When do you think that'll happen? Hopefully by the end of the summer but we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and live stock without cash. That'll be nice. Shoot. Good. Yeah, it's really nice. I do. Thanks. What? Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome. Good morning. How are you feeling today? Good. There's this great juice shop in town, I got us a couple of juices. 22. This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives me energy, so I thought it might help you. Martha takes a sip. It tastes terrible but she drinks it. I got pineapple orange too if that's better. Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks. I also got a box of these protein bars just in case you want to snack. Why is the house so big? It's not that big. For two people, it's huge. We like to entertain. Our friends come up for weekends and sometimes we have parties. It's just good to have space. So no one else lives here? Of course no one else lives here. You're married? Yeah. When? Earlier this year, in the spring. I tried to get in touch with you, apparently you got rid of your cell phone? I lost it. You never got a new one? I got used to not having it. No thanks. Was it a big wedding? No, about forty people. Mostly his family. Did Aunt Dora come? Yeah. Did she smoke like chimney and complain about everything. She's not that bad. You never had to live with her. She lived with me after mom died. College. Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're okay. She hates me. She doesn't hate you. Look at me. I hate her. Relax, I don't have any pictures of you. Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying. There you go! Don't shake it, that's a myth. Is it true married people don't fuck? What? No! Put this on. You're kidding. Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it. Why does it matter? It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable. It looks good you little shit. Whatever makes you happy mama bear. You're making fun of me and I think it looks really good. It's no good? It's not dry. It just needs a little salt. What are you laughing about I cooked for you your whole life. You microwaved chicken nuggets and fish sticks. Ted and Martha continue to laugh. Lucy gets up from the table. She comes back with salt and dumps it on the food. Yeah. I wish I didn't have to go  tomorrow. No, I don't want to leave her alone. You'll be nice to her right? Right. I know you feel like something bad just happened Marcy May, but you have to trust me, that was not bad, it was truly good. We've all been in this situation, and we wouldn't all still be here if what happened in that room was bad. We all love each other very much, we are all together on this, you have to trust us. Do you believe me? You're so lucky, I'd give anything to have my first time again. Really? Yeah, it's so special. I can't remember anything, I just woke up on the floor and felt this pain - That's the cleansing. It's good. It means it's working if you can't remember things. You're cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins. Martha is distant. You need to share yourself, don't be so selfish. I'm not. So smile then, enjoy this amazing night. It only happens once. Zoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead. They curl up together in a very intimate way. Martha smiles. Zoe kisses her on the lips. Martha is caught off guard. She laughs. They have a second peck on the lips before closing their eyes to sleep. Cleaning. I thought I'd help out more. Is Lucy coming? Oh. It's okay. Yeah. Fine. No. Why? I don't know, it's normal I guess. She hasn't changed much. Where is she? Why? I can't imagine it Lucy holding a child. She wouldn't know what to do with it. Do you want a baby? So you're unhappy! Why? I lost track I guess. I didn't think Lucy would worry about me. Can I go swimming? No. I can't. What? What? Martha, what are you doing? Nothing! Jesus, you can't just come in like that. Sorry. God damn it, what's wrong? It's been hard to sleep alone. Stay, just stay. Why would you think it was okay to come in like that? I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys were on the other side. You can't come into our room when we're having sex, that's not normal! It's  private. Sorry. Don't apologize, I just want you to understand why it's not okay. Okay. Do you? Yeah. Well? Because it's privte and it's not normal. Just lie down Martha. I'm sorry you slept out here. Thanks for being patient. I just want to make sure she's okay. I know. I know you are. That has nothing to do with Martha. I'm her only family. She needs to be able to depend on me right now. It's complicated Ted. Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night? No. Maybe it's the pine cones. Where did you pick up gardening? We had a garden where I lived? You're good. I'm good at some things. I know you are. Was he ever physical with you? Who? Your boyfriend. What do you mean? Did he ever, hit you? No. You had a bruised ear, and when you called me you were hysterical. Are you sure? Yes. You can tell me. He never hit me. I wish you felt more comfortable talking to me. I do. So talk. There's nothing to talk about. I had a boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's it, everything doesn't have to be a big Don't stare! You okay? Yeah. He's right. I don't know why I'm so weak. You're not. You'll quit. Who's that? Her name's Sarah I think. You should handle her. You think? You're ready. Zoe can help but you'll be great. Whose car was that? I don't know. Why? Just curious. There's a hiking trail, people leave  their cars there all the time. Sorry. You're going to hurt someone. Can you go get me a large jug of water. What's wrong with the tap? I like bottled. It's a waste. Will you get it or not? Did you know that guy? What guy? The guy in the store. The one you almost ran into? No. He was looking at me like he knew me. Did you say something to him? Like what? I don't know, you tell me. What are you talking about? He was staring at me like he knew me, did you talk to him about me? No. Jesus. The guy was checking you out  Martha! Relax. (Lucy starts the car.)  42. If you don't want guys to drool all over you, then wear more clothes- Just drive the car Lucy. What? Drive the car! I don't think we should have the party. Things are just too stressful right now. I'm sure people would understand- I just think it would be best. For all of us. And that's the end of it, because you say  so. We share all of this, if it fits, you can  wear it. Cool. This is where we sleep. You can take any  bed that's open or you can sleep  downstairs. I'm hungry, can we eat? We don't eat until the evening. Really? You'll get used to it. Your body doesn't  need that much food. You're taught to  overconsume. He's beautiful. Whose the mother? Katie's, but we all help out. Is Patrick the father? Uh huh. They look just like him. All the kids here are boys? He only has boys. You're good with them. You want to hold him? No Thanks. I don't have to take care of them do I? Not if you don't want to. There are  plenty of jobs to be done. You'll find your role. It takes time for  people to find their role in a new  family. I called my dad today to ask for money. Does Patrick know? He asked me to. Sometimes, if there's  something we really need I'll call. How was it? Fine, they're not bad people. Did he give you the money? Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs. Do you tell him you're not? No, that's why he gives it to me. I guess  he'd rather pay for it than think I'm  sucking dick for it. I've done drugs. Not a lot but I've tried  everything pretty much, except heroin. It's good to try everything at least  once. You find out who you are that way.  What about drinking, do you drink? I have, but I don't. Good, we don't drink. It just makes you  angry and less focused. Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't  talk to our old families. I wouldn't call my Dad anyway, no matter  how much he paid me. Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet? That's enough. Half is fine. I'll do these if you want to go to bed. I don't mind. Get some sleep. Okay. Oh, hi. Hi. What do I have to do? Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it will help you relax. It's herbal. It's the start of your cleansing. We've all done it so you know there's nothing to worry about. Do I have to wear this robe? I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a part of it. You look amazing. It's your special night with him, enjoy it, you'll be great. Thanks. Shouldn't we start cooking? I just made some potato salad. Ted's cooking the fish. I thought we were going to cook. We cooked last night. Oh, yeah. Do you ever have this thing where you can't tell if something's a memory or if it's something you've dreamed? Not really. Do you blame me for anything? No. Like what? No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm  just wondering if I should have come back  and kept you in school and helped you go  to college, you had so much potential. I don't need your guidance, I never did.  I'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now I know I am, I know who I am. Teacher and a leader? What are you talking about? I always encouraged you to  do more, but you shut me out. Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head. Dinner's ready. For what? I don't know. No. Why? There are other ways to live. Sure. I don't know. People don't need careers, people should just exist. He's just saying we should start talking about what you're interested in. Maybe we can help you get some ideas together. You can do that if you want to. It's not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions. It's just not the right way to live. You don't know anything about it. Hello...Hello. Who's this? Who's this? Zoe? She not there? She's not. Where is she? Who is this? Who is this? It's Marlene Lewis. Who's this. I'm surprised your dumb ass even knows  how to load it. What happened Doc? I should be teaching  you. Alright, my turn. Alright Max, was this just an excuse to  grope Marcy. What do you mean? They're living animals. I can't. I trust you. You okay? Where are you going to go? You don't want to do that. Max, they're not rules. It's just common  sense. It's not about taking shit. And that's why you don't get to come.  You just don't get it. You need to quit drinking. You're still living with all the shit you  carried out there. You're the only one,  let it go. No. You can't try. You have to stop. They  love you, they just want you to be  stronger. You'll be okay. Sorry. No. I can't sleep. I should try to sleep. It's alright. It's your house. You can not be serious right now. One minute you're going after Martha at the dinner table, then you're curling up together on the couch? You really do think I'm stupid don't you? You can lose your temper at will but when I get pissed off, I'm being crazy or ridiculous! I couldn't possibly be mad for a reason. Fuck you. I just want you to think about how walking in on that might make me feel. You're unbelievable. You shouldn't smoke. What? I don't smoke. Especially if you're trying to have a kid. Maybe you should mind your own business. I can't deal with talking to anyone right now. What's you name? What's your name? I used to like this. I thought you weren't supposed to drink Mike. You think you're so fucking smart. Hey, what happenind? We all need to leave. What? He's a fucking liar. We all need to leave. What are you talking about? We have to leave. We all have to leave. I know him. Who? What the fuck is wrong with you? You don't want to live with this Lucy. Martha. What are you talking about? They're here. Breath. Don't touch me, you're not listening to me! Martha please try to breath. I don't know what you're talking about. Uh huh. It's too hot, let it cool for a minute. Thanks mom. I'm sorry I ruined the party. Everything was fine. Is it over? Yes, you slept through the night. That's good. Are you going to drink the tea? I don't want it. We have to do something. Watts! How long do you think we'll be down here? It'll just be a few days. Just to be safe. Do you feel alright? If you hit your head  you shouldn't sleep. Do you know why we're down here? What do you think it was? Do you still think about leaving? No. I just wanted to see about you. Hello? Who's this? Can I help you? It's Marlene Lewis. What's your last name Jane. I don't know, do you? It's a Jane. Nothing till they're done. You know better. I know. Sorry Katie. What? Who's Katie? Oh, nothing. Lucy? Yeah. Is this from the past or is this now? What? I don't remember waking up this morning. Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish up. Who the fuck knows. I know. Places? I don't want to talk about it anymore. Zoe? Yeah. I can't stop feeling terrible for that poor man. I know. It happens though, we're never really dead or alive, we just exist, so he's still existing, but it's in a parallel time. Just don't think about it, it's in the past. Martha, it's me, can I come in? I have. We do! I'm sorry. Are you alright? What the fuck happened? You could have killed him. I was confused. About what, what are you so confused about? I thought he was someone else. You thought he was someone else? What is wrong with you? I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing this anymore. I beat myself up over you for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of chasing you down and worrying about you. I need to move on. I'm sorry. You need help Martha. I know. What happened to you? What happened to you? I don't know. We're going to get you proper help. Are you going to send me away? I don't know how to help you anymore. Please don't. Please don't. I can't help you. Please, I can't be alone, please. We're trying to start a family and I don't trust you to be here. Lucy? What? What? You're going to be a terrible mother. Do you have any money left? Of course you don't. We'll make sure everything is taken care of. Going swimming? Yeah. It's a bit chilly. I don't mind. I think we both said some things last night that we didn't mean. Yeah. We scheduled an appointment for you tomorrow morning. What's it like there? It looks nice. We're heading back to the city in about an hour. You'll be ready to go? Yep. Are you okay? Fucking idiot. What was he doing?
