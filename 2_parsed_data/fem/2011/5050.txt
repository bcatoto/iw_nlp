Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice to meet you. Cotton. You're funny. Yup. Take it home. You're so funny. Here comes the choo-choo! (asleep and incoherent) Make it stop. Mmmmm. Oh my god. I think you have a gray hair. I'm gonna pull it out. (in a Hungarian accent) Welcome home Mr. Adam. I made vegetarian goulash. (still using accent) What is wrong? (still using accent) Liar. Why? What's going on? What kind of doctor's appointment? You mean with Bette Midler? Not as good as "The Rose", but good. Yeah. Sad....What does that have to do with you? Oh. Oh my god. What kind? You don't know? Well how bad is it? (begins to cry) You have cancer. Not now. Adam I'm 24 years old! You're 25. What are we going to do? I don't know what to do. Do they know? There they are! I can't wait to hear the big news. So what's for dinner? If I had known you were coming I would have made something else. I'm just glad to finally be sharing a shabbat dinner with my son... (looks at her plate) So this isn't meat? No it's called sei-tan. But it's not meat. No, but it has a texture just like meat. Mmmmm. It's Good. Art, take your pills. Swallow. So? Did you set a date? A date? Do not do summer like your cousin, remember how awful that was? Schlepping around in the heat like that. Plus the bugs and the gnats. And now Rachel. I know we haven't discussed this, but are you going to convert? (whispers to Adam) She thinks we're getting married. Oh thank god. No offense. So then what's the big news that you made us rush all the way over here. Oh jesus Adam, just tell her. Tell me what? Oh Adam, don't be so overdramatic. I promise...You make me out to be some kind of irrational loon. What? What is he saying? Cancer? What do you mean you have cancer? I don't understand. I'm making you green tea. I saw on the Today Show that it reduces your risk of getting cancer by fifteen percent. Here take these. Aspirin, Zoloft, Lexapro, Lipitor, Flagel, Ditropan, Alka Seltzer. Just take the god-damn pills. How could this happen? Genetic? It must be from your father's side of the family, they're always getting sick. Your uncle Bobby just got Crohns. I'm moving in. Adam, I'm your mother, and I need to be close to you in your time of need. Well who's going to take care of you? I think I have a right to take care of my son with cancer. Nothing! You tell me you have cancer of the spine and now you tell me it's nothing. Edith, I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But I promise, there's nothing for you to worry about. I'm going to be here every step of the way, to help take good care of your son. You're a very lucky boy to be with such a good girl. You know that? You don't deserve her. (mouth full of food) Can I help you? Please call me Katie. You were expecting someone else? Why? Did someone say that's what I look like? Sorry to disappoint you. Twenty-six. Who? Does he work here? I'm actually in my final semester of medical school. (off Adam's look) This is a training hospital. You're actually my first. Please sit. Dr. Ross filled me in on your situation. Tell me, how have you been feeling? I think that's great considering what you're going through. But there's a reason. You chose to use humor rather than express how you really feel. In order to heal the body, you must heal the mind. It's imperative that you free yourself from stress and anger. Get rid of all those negative emotions stored deep inside. So today what I want to do is start you on some very simple relaxation therapy. I want you to lay back and close your eyes. Yes, I want you to just lay back, and let go. Another joke? Ssshhhhh... Close your eyes and relax. Find a place inside yourself where you can escape the cancer. Okay. Open your eyes. Surprise! It's Noodle. Adam, IT's a he, and HE's adorable...Having a dog is supposed to help with the healing process. I thought you'd be happy... I didn't realize it would be such a big deal. I can bring him back to the shelter in the morning. No, you're right, it's not a good idea. Tomorrow I'll take him back where he'll be kept in a tiny cage with 10 other dogs who will bully him, and rape him, and then he'll eventually be euthanized. Really? This is going to be so good for you. You want to know the secret? Eat nothing but green foods. No, any green food. It works, my sister's friend survived lung cancer. There's spinach, zucchini, broccoli, kale, cucumbers, green beans, snow peas, seaweed, kiwi, Zucchini, Zucchini... Are you paying attention? Cause I'm only trying to help save your life. ...Brussel Sprouts, Turnip greens, Asparagus, Celery, Cabbage, Okra, Honeydew Melon, Limes, Green bell peppers, green chiles... I can't believe that he has cancer. I've seen him every day for the past two years and I've never once made an effort to talk to him. Oh what does it matter? It's too late. Adam, those people just threw you a party...They love you. Nothing. I love you. Everything's going to be okay. I'm totally yours, Noodle. The dog. I think he needs to go out. I can't do this with him barking. Hold me. Do you want me to? Okay. In the morning. Art come on. We're late. What about those seats up there in the front? Please. My son has cancer. Sorry, my son has cancer. Edith. How are you? Oh Rose. Things are not well. I heard about the cancer. I can't tell you how hard it's been on me. My only child. God only knows what terrible thing I did to deserve this. I've got a catatonic husband and a son with cancer. Not to mention my arthritis. I don't know how I'll ever get through it. Hey you! What do you think you're doing? Read the sign. Then what's that? So how do you feel after your first treatment? Is everything with you going to be a joke? Adam, you have a responsibility to your mind and body. You can't just sit there and ignore what's happening to you...You need to stop bottling everything up. Have you considered that this cancer is nature's way of telling you to change the way you live your life? (off Adam's look) ...There's an old saying - you can't change the wind, but you can adjust the sails. I know you don't like to talk about your feelings, but you have to learn to find an outlet. And how is your body ever going to fight the stress of that cancer if you can't even handle your own emotions? You don't have to be here. I want you to do some homework. Here's a list of books on mind-body therapy. They should help you get started. Yes, how can I help you? Oh. Are these for...I'm sorry it's none of my business. How awful. Poor guy. It's bad isn't it? He likes running around with the other dogs. Are you smoking weed? Since when do you smoke? You got a prescription for medicinal marijuana? What's wrong with you? Where did that TV come from? I thought we already agreed that my painting was going there. You want me to put my painting next to a television? Art needs to breathe Adam!...Do whatever you want. I'm taking your dog to the park!...And open a window. This isn't a dorm room. Adam! This is fantastic. You know if you're interested, there are some more advanced forms of therapy that I think could be really useful. Yesterday, I confiscated my son's pornography collection and then used it to masturbate 6 times. Adam? What are you doing? What time is she coming? It's six thirty. You want a ride? Sorry about the mess. I know, I know. What can I say? I'm not good at getting rid of things. I get easily attached. So you don't drive? But you have a license? No! But, I thought you can re-take the test. What did you do? The garden with all the endangered plants? I'm sorry. That's terrible. Why what's wrong? What are you doing? Wait, no, not that, that's my dinner. It probably wouldn't be very professional of me. Uh, okay. But I can't stay long. You know you are terrible at this? This is your Playstation. Perhaps you'd prefer something a little more simple. Maybe a nice game of Connect Four or Bingo. That must have been hard, seeing him lose his cognitive skills like that. You've never talked about your dad. Hey! Rematch? No, but it's supposed to be really good for you. You complain a lot. I try not to look at the world like that. Hmmm. I really don't like it when people at work finish all the coffee and don't refill the pot. I wouldn't say infuriating. It's just not good work place etiquette. Oh god, that's disgusting. I'm so sorry. Hold on. I'm so sorry. I should probably be going. Adam? I hope I'm not interrupting. This is your therapist? Please, call me Katie. OK. Katie. What are you doing here? Ugh. Shit. Thank you so much for doing that. Life's been a little crazy lately, which I'm sure Adam has told you all about. I love those shoes. Thanks... I'm going to go. I'll see you at our next session Adam. I was at the gallery. I know. I'm sorry. I totally spaced. With the opening only three months away my head's just all over the place. (off Adam's look) 79. Don't look at me like that. You know this is a hard time for me. I'm not just some car service here to shuttle you around! And what is it that I'm not taking responsibility for? I can't handle this! You make it sound like I'm your wife. I'm sorry if your cancer isn't turning me on. You think this is easy for me seeing you sick like this? The past few months have been hard on me too. It's not always about you. Why are you so good? What's wrong? Why? You're being awfully quiet today. Is everything okay? What are you talking about? We don't know that. Don't say that, you're doing so well. What are you talking about? This is really good Adam. Let it out. This helplessness you're feeling is normal. These emotions you're holding onto are what make you human. But it doesn't mean you can just stop living your life. Look at how you've grown over the past few months, you can't just throw it all away...Talk to me. Okay, I'll pick one up. Am I getting fat? What? Yes. Of course. The Doctor wanted me to apologize for running late, he's just in with another patient, but should be out in a few minutes. You guys holding up alright? It's very cold in here. Is there anyway you can turn down the Air Conditioning? Unfortunately the temperature is controlled by a central thermostat. My son has cancer. I'm sorry, really, if I could I would, but there's nothing I can do. Are you sure? I could get you a blanket. I'd love a blanket. Okay, but you let me know if you need anything. (Re: the cute nurse) I don't like her. You feel warm. Take these. Do you know what it's like to fear losing your son? No. You don't. When you have children of your own we can discuss it. Now take the pills. Huh. Oh nothing. It's nothing, he went to a state college. I just worry that you're not getting the best care possible. You can be a little shit sometimes, you know that? You think I don't know what's best for you? I birthed you. You came out of me. I am your mother, for better or for worse, so accept it. (Re: fanny pack) You don't like this, well I'm sorry. It's my own way of caring. Yes you did. I drive you crazy. You're all I've got. Look at your father. I've lost him. My true love, gone. I'm never going see him again, at least not in this life. He spent his whole life priding himself on his independence, always too stubborn to ask for help and now look at the son of a bitch. You happy? You like shitting yourself? He was the greatest thing to ever happen to me. And then I had you, and that was even greater. So if I hover and threaten your independence, so what? You have a mother who loves you more than anything. Is that so awful? But he's going to be okay, right? You're going to fix it. Hey you. The girls and I are having a movie night. I somehow got suckered into cooking. (off Adam's look) Don't worry I left you some. Susan. She wants to know what time I'm coming over. Uh huh. I might be out late so don't wait up. What are you doing? My art partner. I can't believe you just invaded my privacy like that. Give me back my phone. Adam, it's not what you think. Don't be like that. I didn't do anything wrong. Adam you're being ridiculous. It's a portrait series, commenting on post-colonial patriarchy in the Congo. (off Adam's look) ...That's it. Nothing more. Oh shit. I forgot. Please, Adam, I'm so sorry. What did the doctor say? Adam stop. Tell me what the doctor said. Are you going to break up with me? Please. I don't want to break up. I told you I couldn't handle this! I'm sorry...I love you. Hello. Adam? I know. It was wrong of me to push you the way I did. I wasn't listening. 106. I could never have handled all of this the way you have. I think you're really brave. Adam, I'm not sure if that's a good idea. Not only am I your therapist, but you're also my first patient, ever. What kind of precedent would I be setting? I can't date you. No I can't. No I can't. Adam I can't date you. Adam? Adam? Adam? Hospital liability and disclaimer forms...in case they need to fuse your spine or remove any organs. You know, the usual. You have some visitors. There he is. Here take these. They're special. I got them from Canada. I know isn't it great? Hello? Alright. Come on Art, let's go to the waiting room. Hmmm. I brought you flowers. Not sure why, I didn't know what else- So how you doing? I'm not going anywhere. I thought he was a pirate. Nurse Wong. Will you Google it? My little boy. Squeeze the morphine trigger! Oh, hello, I didn't see you, ah down there. Yes, I'm looking for Adam Schwartz. (face lights up) You're Adam? The way Mitch described you, I always assumed you to be much older. About 50 years older. But, you're just a baby... Me too. Me? Oh I don't know how to play video games. This food's not going to eat itself. You gonna spend the rest of your life complaining?
