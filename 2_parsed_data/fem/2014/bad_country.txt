They hard as steel and emerald green as emerald green fuckin' comes. Lookit that. That's the real McCoy. That's what that is. I hear that. Jake, get on it. That's thirty grand. Out the door. You interested? Here you go. Fifteen three-karat blues. Wholesale. Twenty large. Comin' up. Man, I ain't sayin' fuckin' shit. That's bullshit. I ain't a rat! He's from Whiskey Bay--! GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE! Help... My baby...my baby... Hey there, Catfish... Goin' to visit my mother. She's real sick. Yeah... Buzz. What can I do y'all for? Wheeler brothers is locked up? I don't know nothin' about that. Well there ain't no "different" to hear, Catfish. 'Cause I ain't talked to neither of 'em. Life. You know how fuckin' long that is, Jesse? So what am I supposed to do? Wait? Run? Your friends are comin' by the house. Askin' questions, hangin' around. Waitin' for the God damn phone to ring. You said we were done with this. That they were out of our lives. We have no money, Jesse. Which means we have no fucking food. ...Say something, would you? I'm afraid. I'm afraid for my life... ...For our baby. I know who you are. We took the bus. Those murders were drug related. DEA's got to do follow ups. I don't understand. Why do we have to leave the state? You're not tellin' me something. You're not tellin' me a lot. Hello... You okay? Honey, you alright? I'll put him on. It's daddy on the phone, say hello. Jesse? No thank you.
