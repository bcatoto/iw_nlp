What are you doing, Snotlout?! They're going to win now! Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury you alive?! The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly! We can still win this thing! Up, up, up! No! You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?! Gotcha! Stormfly! Winning races. What else? The real question is... where have YOU been? Oh, no. What happened now? Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day of goofing off to get started. (continuing her impression You just did. --TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods! Hiccup, that's amazing! What did you tell him? Well, it's a lot of responsibility. The map will have to wait for sure, and I'll need to fly Toothless, since you'll be too busy... I think you're missing the point. I mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be pretty excited. What you're searching for... isn't out there, Hiccup. It's in here. Maybe you just don't see it yet. Hiccup... Hiccup! Dragon army? What are you talking about? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 17. He's expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow. Stormfly! C'mon, go! Go! You should've seen their fort. All blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice. It was weird. Hiccup, don't. What are you doing? How is this a plan? He can be really persuasive. Let's go. ... but a mother never forgets. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 38. Come... This way. Come. Come. Quickly! You're not upset? At least I'm not boring... right? Do you like it? Can I... ? He's beautiful! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 41. Incredible. He might very well be the last of his kind. And look, he's your age! No wonder you get along so well. And retractable teeth? Ah! How did you manage to-- This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps. This Raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting. And this poor Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare... then left to die alone and scared. (re: Toothless' tail) And what of this? Did Drago or his trappers do this, too? What did your father think of your Night Fury friend? If only it were possible. -- Believe me, I tried, as well. But people are not capable of change, Hiccup. Some of us... were just born different. Stop! You'll only make it worse! Hiccup! Don't! Stoick! You and your father nearly died that night, all because I couldn't kill a dragon. It broke my heart to stay away, but I believed you'd be safer if I did. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 45. Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm me. He must've thought I belonged here... In the home of the great Bewilderbeast. The alpha species. One of very few that still exist. Every nest has its queen, but this is king of all dragons. With his icy breath, this graceful giant built our nest. A safe haven for dragons everywhere. He protects us. We all live under his care. And his command. All but the babies, of course... HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 46. ... who listen to no one. I've lived among them for twenty years, Hiccup, learning their ways, discovering their secrets... He likes you. You must be hungry. Good. It's feeding time. I don't like it. They should've been back with Hiccup by now. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 47. What if Drago shot them down? What if they need our help? We have to find them. It doesn't matter what he said, if they've all been captured. Come on! Careful what you wish for! A kidnapping. You're gonna show us the way to Drago. That can be arranged. Stormfly, drop it. Good girl! Stormfly, fetch. Works every time. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 49. (with a mischievous grin) Oh, we are. When I'm up here, I don't even feel the cold. I just feel... This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup. Incredible. All this time, you took after me. And where was I? I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start over? Will you give me another chance? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 52. I can teach you all I've learned, these past twenty years. Like... Now you can make those tight turns. Every dragon has its secrets. And I'll show them all to you. We'll unlock every mystery, find every last species, together, as mother and son. This gift we share, Hiccup... it bonds us. This is who you are, son. Who we are. We will change the world for all dragons! We will make it a better, safer place! What? There's no talking to Drago. -- No. We must protect our own. Now come on, we should be getting back. Never take a toy from a dragon. Don't you know anything? What's down there? What are you doing? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 56. What?! Are you kidding me?! Drago doesn't have them after all. Hundreds! A whole island full! Oh, yes they will! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 57. They know we're missing and they have tracking dragons. If you so much as touch us, Hiccup is gonna He's only the son of Stoick the Vast... ... his heir to the throne of Berk... and the greatest dragon master this world has ever seen! And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters! I know what you're going to say, Stoick. How could I have done this? Stayed away all of these years. And why didn't I come back to you? To our son. Well, what sign did I have that you could change, Stoick? That anyone on Berk could? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 61. I pleaded so many times to stop the fighting, to find another answer, but did any of you listen? I know that I left you to raise Hiccup alone... but I thought he'd be better off without me. And I was wrong, I see that now, but... Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING! You are a steaming heap of dragon -- Meatlug? I'm... a little out of practice. And love me for eternity. My dearest one, my darling dear, you mighty words astound me. But I've no need of mighty deeds, when I feel your arms around me. I have no use for rings of gold. I care not for your poetry. I only want your hand to hold. I only want you near me. No need for drastic measures. Yes! We have to save the dragons. You really are full of surprises. Let's go! Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's it! Look out! Where have you been? That's your mother?! You cannot take our dragons! They are controlled by the alpha! No. No. Thank you. I'll do my best! Come on, Cloudjumper! No! Stoick... It's not his fault. You know that. No, don't! You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. So frail, so fragile. I feared you wouldn't make it. But your father... he never doubted. He always said you'd become the strongest of them all. And he was right. You have the heart of a chief and the soul of a dragon. Only you can bring our worlds together. That is who you are, son. But won't that Bewilderbeast just take control of these guys, too? Take them down, babe! Go get `em. No! No... To protect you. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 93. Stormfly! Your father... he'd be every bit as proud as I am. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 96. And here I'll stay. See? I told you it was in here.
