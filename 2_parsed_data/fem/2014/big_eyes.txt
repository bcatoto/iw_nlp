Good luck. (quiet; a soft Southern lilt) My husband and I are separated. Sir, I realize I have no employment experience... but I sure need this job. I have a daughter to support. I'm not very good at tooting my own horn... but I love to paint, and if I could just show you my portfolio... I studied at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville, then took Illustration classes in New York. Here's a pastel I did... here's some fashion design... a portrait in charcoal... though I enjoy mixing mediums, preferably oil and ink... Sugar, you made it! You're in North Beach! Deirdre, look at you! "Dee-Ann." "Dee-Ann"?! Yeah, I know. But I hit this scene... and "Deirdre" just sounded like something my mother would call me. So are you flipping for all this?! Are you settled? How's Jane? Jane -- is swell. She's started in a sweet little school. Though... it's hard without her father. I'm not sure we can do this... Oh stop that. You're better off. Between us, I never liked Frank. You were a bridesmaid! Exactly. That's why I couldn't speak up. But if I ever see you wrong off again, I will tell you. Now come on. Let's have some fun. Toss off your middle-class preconceptions! This is Pompeii! We're livin' in the volcano!! For jazz, check up the hungry i. For Italian, Vanessi's. For salvation, try the Buddhist temple. For art, the Six Gallery -- Do they only show Modern? Everyone only shows Modern! In the basement, they've got espresso. What's espresso? Is that like reefer? You've got a lot to learn! Today's a special: Two dollars. All finished. I'm just glad they liked it. M-Margaret... Wouldn't you rather flirt with those dolls over there? Nah. But that IS me! And that's me... (she POINTS all over) And that one started as me, but then Mother turned it into a Chinese boy. Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture...! I can't believe you lived in Paris. I've never even been on an airplane. You're a romantic. I've never acted freely. I was the daughter. The wife. The mother... All my paintings are of Jane, because she's all I know. Walter, I'd bet you could paint anything. This is moving fast. You're my first date in a long time... Sweetie, could you stop fidgeting? Mother, after all this time, you MUST know what my face looks like. Hey! Your canvas is blank! Jane! Don't bother Mr. Keane. You know creativity has to well up from the inside... I believe things can be seen in eyes. They're the windows of the soul -- Eyes are how I express my emotions. That's how I've always drawn them. When I was little, I had surgery that left me deaf for a period. I couldn't hear, so I found myself staring... Relying on people's eyes... What was that?? You're a -- Realtor? And you're... ashamed? A-hem! Frank wants to take away Jane. He says I'm an unfit mother... He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. It's beyond my abilities as a single woman... Walter! I -- "Hawaii"? M-marriage? Walter, I'm crazy about you... but I'm overwhelmed. Why would we go to Hawaii?! You're right... this is paradise. Only God could make those colors. Oh, can't we stay here forever?? This is a waterfall... the air was so fresh you could taste it. Here's an ancient altar... that statue is Kane, the god of creation. I said a prayer to him. Oh! Here's Walter and Janie, building a sandcastle -- This is all happening mighty quick. In the time you moved here, I've had two dates. You're already married. I thought there was a void in my life. Well... Walter's filled it. Walter's filled a lot of things. He's diddled every skirt on the art circuit. You're talking about my husband! I know! That's why I brought it up. I'm not naive. (beat; she laughs) Well, I am naive. But I know the man I'm marrying. Walter can act rash... but he's a good provider. And he's wonderful with Jane. Look -- we're both looking for a fresh start. I'm a divorcee with a child. Walter is a blessing. "You are on the threshold of untold success." It's quite gestural. I heard Tab Hunter was in here, looking at one. (glancing back and forth) Uh, I could come back later... I think people buy art because it touches them -- I've never posted bail before. Since when are you thin-skinned? Artists have to handle criticism. I don't understand. Why would you do such a thing?! Don't ever do it again. There must be two-hundred dollars... Walter, they take at least a week. There's layering, shading -- Mrs. Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so late... but would you mind watching Jane? They hold so much feeling. Walter...? Why are you lying? You're taking credit for something that isn't yours. Those children are part of my being! They couldn't meet me, because you told me to stay home!! You take this so lightly -- I'm glad you can dash off your pieces without any emotional connection...! Don't you mean... one of your good ones? What about... honesty? But... isn't it strange? Artists get shown. They don't build their own galleries. I remember when Momma painted that. Are you -- sure? That was a long time ago. Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen -- No, Mother did! Look! I'm wearing my blue dress. L-lots of girls have that dress... Well you did a really good job. Hello. I've -- never really done this before. I'm not sure how you... I was raised Methodist. If it's a problem, I can go -- I lied to my child. My husband... he pressured me into doing it. I've never lied to her before. I'm not that kind of person. Ummm, no. I don't think of him that way. I mean, he likes to tell stories... maybe he exaggerates a little... but he's a good man. He takes care of us. He wants to make enough money to buy our family a house... "Harm"?? Oh! Not at all. I'm just looking for answers... N-no. That's not what -- Hey, baby! Killer party! It's a hap- pen-ing...! So, where's your stuff? Oh. Um, we decided that this would be Walter's show -- Oh "we" did?? And why would "we" do that?? Well... he's more established. Please! Is that you talking, or did you just turn into a little felt puppet with someone's hand up your ass? It's strange... Walter doesn't strike me as the cute hungry kitten type... Thanks for coming. I don't... know. Mom! I wanna come in. (she BANGS again) Let me in! What are you doing in there? Why's the door always locked? I dunno. I'm not really comfortable with this. Jane and I used to be so close... but -- now... Maybe I'm lightheaded from the turpentine. I've been in here all day. Do you -- like it? No. The secret is the shadow. I shadowed the eyelid. Is that your best version of sincerity? You're going to be on television?! Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession with little girls. I guess you've painted yourself into a corner. Walter... art is personal. What about your Paris street scenes? Why do you paint those? (calling his bluff) And was it really all sun-dappled streets and flower vendors? "Sales?" None with this crowd. These people are looky-loos! They can't afford the paintings. But we gave away a heap of posters! What time is it? I've been... busy. No --! It's just... something I'm working on. It's not for the world. No, please! Walter, it's -- personal. Yes it is. It's a self-portrait. I thought... maybe... I could sign it myself. Yes, I know... but... when people ask me if I paint, I don't know what to answer! I just want the pride of being able to say -- that's mine. Nobody! No! NOBODY saw it! I KNOW! My God! I live with this every minute of my life! Janie used to have a mother who painted. Now what's she think?! I lock myself in this room ten hours a day... and then you walk out with finished paintings! C'mon! You haven't picked up a brush in months! (starting to sob) We used to paint together! Easels next to each other, side-by-side -- I've kept my end of the bargain! I've never told! (she SOBS harder) Please! Just let me have this! What about Georgia O'Keefe? (a bit tentative) Oh... from the world around me. And I love Modigliani's use of line. Who's that? I'm fine, Dad. I lost a tooth. No. It fell out! She handled it. Walter? Walter! We need to speak. What is going on here??! No you didn't. Did she just move in?? How can you keep something so big a secret??? I'm sure she is. I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. Dad told me you had a bunk bed. Take the bed. I can sleep on the No, that's not fair! The floor's fine for me. Do you live far away? I guess... about a twenty minute drive. "Twenty minutes"?! That's close! But you never see Walter? No, I see him all the time! He comes up and visits every week. Doesn't he talk about me? Huh? Uh... sure. I guess a little. Does he talk about me? Uh... yeah. Sometimes. So what's your mom like? She's pretty. She drives a Buick. She cries a lot. Yeah, mine's the same. Except she drives a Packard. I have some peanut butter hidden in my sock drawer. Do you wanna eat it? I painted it! Yes, we don't use my name, since people don't take women's art seriously. "MDH" are my initials. And more! I'm interested in numerology... and as you know, seven is a very good number. Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret Doris Hawkins! "M" is the 13th letter of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals 16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven! Rembrandt, shush! My God! I thought I misread the address. Yeah. That driveway is long. (she giggles, embarrassed) Honestly, I can't believe I live here. Whoa. I know! Two acres, a pool, five Three? I thought there were four. What? Oh -- you mean Lily! No, she doesn't really live with us. That was just in the articles. Crazy. A fake daughter... It's been so long since I've seen you. I know. North Beach is 30 miles, but it might as well be 300... You're probably busy, hanging out with your new rich buddies. "Kim Novak." Oh, please! She's Walter's friend. (a quiet shrug) He brings people by... the Beach Boys were here. But, it's pretty isolated. Jane has nice friends. Sometimes I pick them up at the junior high, and we all get pizza. But she's busy... Are you hungry? I'm thirsty. Good! I'll whip us up two gin fizzes. When we moved in, I thought a wet bar was extravagant... but it's surprising how much use you can get out of it. How's Walter? He couldn't be happier. He has everything he ever dreamed of. And so do you! Fabulous. Oh, is that your studio? No --! You can't go in -- I just want a peek. See what the workspace of a wildly successful artist looks like -- Dee-Ann, please! STOP -- W-Walter paints in here too. Is Walter home?? Uh... Dee-Ann was just... she... SHUT UP! You're so full of shit, Walter! Fuck you! I won't. Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball! Okay, honey. I have to go work. Can I come? (an awkward silence) No. I can never come. No! I shouldn't even ask. Where did you appear from? Didn't you hear? No visitors! Is this what it's come to? You're the only living soul I can tell my secret? (she lowers her voice) Well -- I painted them all! (she shudders with release) It's TRUE! I did every single one -- Well, every one except that street scene. But I did the rest. Every Big Eye! And nobody will ever know. But YOU. No you don't! It's nice to have company, but that sofa is new. (she pushes him off) Let's find you some carpet to lay on. I think there's a scrap back here... Well what's this? Maybe you should give her one of your street scenes. No, Walter. She's a dignitary. Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes straight from you? From your experience??? Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already has a Cenic. Cenic is the name of the artist who did all your early paintings. The more you lie, the smaller you seem. Then why do you paint over the name? A bit of advice: Don't use a water- base over an oil. It flecks off. No, I haven't. I always thought I had... but it's some kind of... mirage. From a distance you look like a painter, but up close... there's nothing there. Walter? Have you even been to Paris? I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. I -- I can't keep living these lies. There's three extra bedrooms. Go pick one. A new MDH. Something for me. It's about a woman trapped in an uncaring world. I call it, "Escape." What? And then -- YOU'LL paint them? Walter, this isn't paint-by-numbers! You think it's easy?! It took me years to learn -- If you knew the basics, you wouldn't be at the easel. You have to sketch it first! I dunno. You tell me. You're the creator. Oh, a Keane! How witty. You know, when we met all those years ago, I never would've imagined in my wildest dreams that one day -- How old is the subject? It matters! A young child's head is round. An older child's head is oval! NO I'M NOT! Every line is a decision! It's easy to talk about art, but it's not easy to MAKE art!! Oh, you know. Mondays -- Exactly? I dunno, 3,000 or -- Uh, let me -- Mr. Keane, I'd have to make a -- Do you want a glass of water, Mr. Keane? I -- I don't understand. You'll always be famous. You were on the Jack Paar Show... (she glances away) Er, excuse me, sir. (trying to hold her ground) I know the truth. NO! Absolutely NOT!! I still hate myself for giving you the Waifs! Oh, I'll talk as LOUD AS I WANT -- What??! You're threatening me...?! Fine, kill me! My God, I've kept our secret for years! I've never once -- Do you know what it's been like for me? I don't have any friends. I've lied to my own child... What do you want, Walter? Everything with you is calculated. We're back where we had our first date... What masterpiece? You sound insane. Artists don't announce a masterpiece -- He worked on that for FOUR YEARS! It's too big. Why'd you promise them Cinerama size? You're right! Where are your preliminary sketches?? All that time in art school, and somehow we waylaid your youthful experiments! The half- finished charcoals, the struggles... Get out of here. I'm trying to work. Mom, what's for dinner? Mom! Are you home...? W-what are you doing in here --? This is -- Walter's studio! You have to leave! Mom... I know. Jane, you don't know anything!! I'm not a child anymore. I was happier selling paintings in the park. Friday, I file for divorce. How could anyone... say something so cruel? Ow! Walter! Mom, what are we gonna do??! We're leaving. I'm sorry I wasn't the mother I could have been. I -- I should have done this years ago... But where are we going? We don't even have any clothes! Where we're going, we won't need much. Hawaii. Really...? Yes, Hawaii. Because it's paradise. There's flowers, and birds, and beautiful colors. And... we're going to make a new life for ourselves. Hello? It's a decree of legal separation. I would appreciate if you signed it. Walter, our marriage is over. Walter, I want a divorce. If that's the price. My God, Walter! How much more money do you need? Would you like to go into town? I'm stopping by the post office. No, I'm gonna surf with the gang. Your friends are a bit... wild. Loosen up, Mom! You're impossible! You move me all the way to Hawaii. Then I actually make some friends, and all you do is complain about them. Maybe you need to make some. Y-you know I can't have people over to the house. That's right! Or they'd see the precious paintings!! I'm not interested. I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. From where I'm standing, I don't see much good anywhere. Just a lot of pride, and thievery, and people treating each other poorly. Sounds like my ex-husband. Would you like to come in? It's been so long since I've been happy. But, I don't even know why I'm telling you... two complete strangers. So you're -- Jehovah's Witnesses? I've explored so many religions. But they all had their flaws... And how do you know...? What does that mean, exactly? It says here a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things. I just can't believe you let people in the house. I have nothing to hide! It also says no lies. "Speak truth. Let the stealer steal no more." No... Big Lolo. Everything you just said is false. One: Walter is no longer my husband. (a long pause) And Two: He's not... a painter. No. Though he's been taking credit for ten years. I'm the only painter in the family. I knew it!!! He made me sound crazy!! But how can I?! He claims I copied HIM! That he taught ME how to paint! (reading the NEWSPAPER) "She used a slide projector to trace my work and fill in the colors." When I finally told the truth, I felt good about myself for the first time in years!! I'm not going to let him take that away. Hey. Is Jehovah okay with suing?? I was forced into it. You had -- He had me dominated. He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. I was afraid. I didn't see any option, so I went along. I felt very bad... I just gave in. I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. They reflected all my feelings... and... it was like losing a child... I was weak. I didn't feel I could leave and support myself and my daughter. He said nobody would buy the paintings without his personality. Maybe he was right... You were very talented at being charming. You were a genius at salesmanship and promotion. That's you, Walter. Jekyll and Hyde. (she loses her temper) No! You're outrageous! Constantly criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying I'd be "knocked off" if I ever told the truth!! Thank you! Thank you so much. "Exhibit 224." Oh... it was never about the money. And honestly -- I doubt Walter will even pay. I just wanted credit for what I had done. The justice is... I got my art back. My prayers have been answered.
