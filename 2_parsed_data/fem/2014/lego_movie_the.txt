Emmet! Did you clean your room?! The cleaning woman is coming today! Because I want her to know what a nice rule-following son I have! Aw, it is clean. Just like I taught you. I just love you and want my son to be safe and happy. Can't you work from home? Like a sociopath or children's book author? My boy. All grown up. Maybe soon you'll meet a girl and be married! I'm just saying, it's been how many years since Lucy? I hated that day. The kids were so mean, the school tried to expel you... I promised myself I'd never let anything like that happen to you again. And it hasn't. So you need to let your memory of that day go. It never happened. Listen. You're my son. And you're the most normal, regular, average person I know. Yeah. No. Yes. Emmet... Don't forget dinner. Be safe. Don't make waves. And follow the instructions. If they weren't so firm and flush with your head, I would pinch your cheeks right now. Love you. I'm breaking you out. Well I'm temporarily reversing my position for reasons of convenience. The rules are different now. No you didn't. Great. Fine. Would you mind holding my purse? Saving your life. You wanna bet? Come on. You have to trust me-- I tried, and look what happened! As a matter of fact I did. All the time. Emmet! EMMET!!! What do you want with me?! You have the wrong person! It's Gemini now. No. Okay. Emmet?! Don't you dare hurt him. Is this really the best time to talk? Fine. Shoot. Hardly. By the way, I'm seeing someone now, so don't get any ideas. You don't get it, do you? They're here for the Chosen One. Not you. Your mom. I was sent to get her, but they got to her first. Emmet, your mother is the most powerful being in the universe. Don't we all. She and I belong to an ancient brotherhood of MasterBuilders, who create from our imaginations, not instructions, forced underground by evil forces. She has long been in hiding to protect you from those forces. I was sent to summon her, but when I showed up she was too busy breaking you out of prison. Just hold the wheel. How... Emmet! Jump! It didn't break. How? You have a lot of questions. They all work for the Black Falcon. Otherwise known as Rodrigo Falcone, the C.E.O. of Empura? He is also the self-declared Emperor of all known LEGO realms. He kidnapped your mom because she is the only one who can stop him from destroying us all. Emmet, did your mom have a safe deposit box, a safe, something where she would have hidden something very valuable? (pulling out items) No...no...no...no...no...no... No...no...no...no...no...no... No...no...no...no...no...no... It's not in there. What's her birthday? Of course. Your birthday. January six. Not by choice. The MasterPiece. Some say it's the first piece ever. No one knows exactly what it does, but it is said the Chosen One will use it to one day save the world. There's an inscription. The prophecy of the Chosen One... Yes. We have to get this to your mom so she can fulfill her destiny and stop the Black Falcon before he destroys us all. What was what? We have to go. NOW. We're going to take the MasterPiece to someone who can help. No. They're gone. All of them. Vitruvius. He was once a great MasterBuilder, now he's...retired. But he's our only hope. I can't, I'm...still in training. I'm not a full-fledged MasterBuilder yet. Technically, I'm an intern. Don't be a putz, Emmet. Iamnotarobot is one of the Black Falcon's robot henchmen. Ever notice how metallic he looks? Don't be naï¿½ve. That. Look, just give me the MasterPiece and I'll take it from here. Well then I guess you're going to have to cross that line. Well then go ahead and do it. Dude! Not everything is what it seems... Annoying short whiners. Plus they reproduce like crazy. It's a real problem. Legopolis is only one realm in the Black Falcon's dominion. He built walls around all of them so he can keep them separate. If the walls came down, he'd have a hard time controlling the results. The MasterBuilders built secret passages through the walls so we could travel between lands. The Black Falcon's sentries. They're looking for us. Shh! You'll never get away with this. I'm all ears. I'm listening. The car in the city. That's why it didn't break... You never did understand the way of the Maker. You want to do this to the whole world? Leave him out of this! No! Don't, please! I'll do what you want, please don't hurt him. No! Do you ever say something that isn't a stupid question? I guess not. That's Dragon. A blind man. His mother is the Chosen One. I was sent to summon her. The Black Falcon got to her first. He has the Kragle. The other MasterBuilders are gone. Hey Rod. What's that? Vitruvius, you can still help us. Hope? That's super constructive, thank you. We don't have that kind of time! Why do you care? It's not exactly a yacht. Gosh, where are my manners? Emmet, this is Neckbeard, my boyfriend. Neckbeard, this is Emmet. We used to date a million zillion years ago. It meant nothing to me. You have heard of Vitruvius, of course. He has an incredible mind. Vitruvius, follow my lead. That's the idea. Build a hatch. Like for a submarine. That's as far as you got?! anyone, because it is the most awesome thing I have ever made. That's the security? Emmet. He doesn't get out much. And where do you come from? Okay. Um, he's a MasterBuilder? No thank you. Is this everyone? King Karl! You betrayed us! You betrayed everything you stand for! No no he's just on teleconference. It's like a phone. A telegram. He's not actually in the room. Sure. Emmet! So wait. What was the purpose of this call then? We have to go now! That's far more impressive than this entire Rocket-Copter. A credit hog. Great. Benny! Focus! What's up? Upset about what? Sorry. We'll find her. I know it. I know you. You don't. I'm just trying to help. What? You may not have a creative bone in your body, but you have a lot of really really earnest bones. You always did. I mean, that day when we were kids, and you drew the face in art class, you inspired me. I thought maybe there was more out there in the world, and maybe you felt the same. That's why I asked you out. But then you ended up like everyone else and broke my heart, you know? That I was going one way and you didn't go with me. We're being so dramatic. It was eighth grade! It made a lot of us dingalings. You know, whenever I doubt myself, I look into this prism I found long ago... I know. It's a relic of the Maker. When I'm feeling low, I look at it, and it always makes me feel like there still is beauty in the world, and we all have a purpose. You know what I mean? Well, good night. How the heck are we going to do this? Really? That's convenient. What about this? Darn. Stop it! Everyone! We don't have time for that. (man voice, into phone) I love you please move in with me. Emmet. They won't budge. The bad guy is going to freeze everyone. Kids? Are you okay? Thank you sweetie. Pass the mustard. That's pretty elaborate. What? Emmet? Why won't anything in this hallway break off?! Yes? Me too... Are you really doing this? Um... No! I know sweetie. I wish I could, son. I wanted you to be safe. I thought you would be happier. When I saw you with that funny drawing, it was so marvelous. And then I thought of what your life would be, how everyone would treat you. I just couldn't let that happen. I...I don't know what to say. It's too horrible to bear. That guy?! Excuse me. I... don't know what to do. So tired... She's too weak. You have to do it. I believe in you, Emmet. I was mad because you disappointed me for a while, but since it wasn't your fault, I'm willing to give you a mulligan on it. A mulligan. It's from golf. The point is, you've spent your whole life wanting to fit in and have friends, by pretending to be something you're not. But now that you've let the real you shine through, you've made some friends who like you for who you are. And even if they're just a crazy spaceman and a pirate head and a blind man and an intern-- I do. ...Sure. You wanted to make your own choices, right? So choose yourself. What is it, Emmet? What do we do? Go after him. Neckbeard! We need to talk... Emmet! Doris, are you okay back there? Doris?! Why did she do that? But it's certain death. Get your hands off my flipping son. I'm the Chosen One, remember? I was wrong, Emmet. (BAM!) All this time I was trying to keep you from getting hurt, so I told you not to make waves. (POW!) I'm just so glad that I get to see the beautiful waves you finally get to make.(SOCKO!) I used a few connections. Emmet, now's your chance! What the heck just happened?
