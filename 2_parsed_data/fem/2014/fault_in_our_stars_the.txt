I'm not depressed. ... she eats like a bird. She barely leaves the house, I'm not depressed. ... she reads the same book over and over... I'm not depressed! The booklets and web sites always list depression as a side effect of cancer... Depression's not a side effect of cancer... ... it's a side effect of dying. Which is what was happening to me. ... some days she won't even get out of bed. Why stop there? Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm like the Keith Richards of cancer kids. She's gone a few times. I'm not sure it's for me. I'm not de-- What? "Journey?" Really? Hazel. I'm, uh, Hazel. 16. Thyroid originally but with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs. Alright? I guess...? It's Friday night. Hmm? I was just thinking... you should call your friends, see what they're up to. That's ok. Why don't you guys go to a movie? (off their look) You haven't been out in a while. Go. Have fun. Take the night off. Ugh. You can't make me. If you want me to be a teenager, don't send me to Support Group. Buy me a fake ID so I can go to clubs and drink gimlets and take pot. See, that's the kind of thing I would know with a fake ID. Get in the car. Are you gonna sit here and wait the whole time? Of course not, no. I... (she totally is) I have errands to run. Ok. Love you. Love you too Mom. Make some friends! I'll take the stairs. Excuse me. I just wanna say... there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead. It might be tomorrow. Might be a million years from now but... it's gonna happen. And when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us, right? Oblivion's inevitable. And if that scares you, well, I suggest you ignore it. God knows it's what everyone else does. Someone should probably tell him, don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart. Hazel. Hazel Grace Lancaster. What? Why are you looking at me like that? I'm not beaut -- Hey Gus. What's with the "always?" He's gotta be hurting her boob. Oh. Um. Uh... (yes!) Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this What? What do you mean "now?" You could be an axe murderer. Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're kidding right? (off his look) You just ruined the whole thing! What, you think that's cool? Oh you idiot! There's always a hamartia, isn't there? And yours is - even though you had FREAKING CANCER you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire EVEN MORE CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so well. Let me tell you... not being able to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks. A fatal flaw. Sorry? Metaphor. Hi sweetheart. Ready for some "Model?" Can't tonight. (off her confused look) I've made plans with Augustus Waters. You don't say. I'm surprised you have a license. Aha. Cancer perk. I was 13 when they found it. (through the tears) Are you ready, sweetie? Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly grown since... Of course my lungs still suck but, theoretically, they could continue to suck in just this way for, I dunno, a while maybe. Yeah. Can't. Got my GED. Augustus, hi. New friend? It's just... Hazel. Nice to meet you! Must have been pretty good. Need to sit. Don't get any ideas. (catching her breath) All that standing... and stairs... and then more standing... lotta standing for me. I'll be fine in a minute. Unless I faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian lady, fainting-wise. I already told you my story. I was Um... No. I'm just... I don't know... un- extraordinary. "An Imperial Affliction." It's a novel. My favorite novel. What? No. Seriously? It's not that kind of book. It's not, it's... kind of my bible actually. Cancer. (off his look) But not in that way, trust me. The guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten, he's... well, the only person I've ever come across who seems to a) understand what it's like to be dying and b) not have died. Not so much cold as under- oxygenated. That's different. Did he give it to you? By "it" do you mean herpes? I'm sure he'll call, don't worry. I'm not worried. Please. It's not like I'm waiting for him to call or anything. I just... we hung out. No big deal. Welcome to the sweet torture of reading "An Imperial --" What the -- are you ok? How ya doing Isaac? Oh I'm sorry. Do you want to talk about it? Fair enough. I actually think his response is appropriate. (lights up at that) You're quoting my book! Sometimes people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them. I know, right? It is rather abrupt. But that's part of what I like about it. It portrays death truthfully. You die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence. But I do - God, I do want to know what happens to everyone else. The Dutch Tulip Man... I've written letters. He's never responded. Apparently he moved to Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't published anything. Doesn't do interviews. Dr. Maria called today. The PET Scan is set for the eighth. I told you Support Group was a good idea. Hello Augustus. You're welcome. What we need is a sequel. That's what I kept asking Van Houten for in my letters. That's correct. Yeee-up. Unfortunately so. Augustus!? Keep reading, keep reading! You're making this up? Holy hell. Can I... would you mind... "I know these are not important literary questions and that your book is full of important literary questions, but I would just really like to know." (reading it aloud to him) "And of course, if ever you do decide to write anything else, even if you don't want to publish it, I'd love to read it. Frankly, I'd read your grocery lists. Yours with great admiration, Hazel Grace Lancaster. Age 16." You think? Is it really almost 1? I gotta get to sleep. Ok... Ok... Ok. Ok. You'll get over her Isaac. Just takes a little time. You'll see. Yeah. (shakes her head) Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go. Gets blood on the first try. (lays it on thick) "I'm gonna stab you with this needle now, so there might be a little ouchie." You doing alright, Isaac? It's a little crazy. (trying to be nonchalant) Was he? The pain? (off his slow nod) Good. Good, Isaac. (Isaac closes his eyes) What about Gus? Holy shit! "Dear Ms. Lancaster... I cannot answer your questions, at least not in writing, because to do so would constitute a sequel, which you might publish or otherwise share on the internet. Not that I don't trust you, but how could I trust you, I barely know you." "Should ever you find yourself in Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your leisure. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten" Son of a - WHAT What's wrong?! (realizing she scared her) Nothing. Sorry. Nothing? Everything! Look! Can we go to Amsterdam? Please? Hazel, I... I love you and... you know I'd do anything for you, but we don't... We don't have the money. The expense of getting equipment over there - love, it's just not possible... No, yeah, of course. I mean, I could talk to your father Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything. Forget I mentioned it. I've used it already. Pre- "Miracle." I was 13... And Epcot Center. We had fun on that trip. I met Goofy... Why are you embarrassed? Wait, what? Gus? Something to drink? You ready Gus? Is this where you bring all your romantic conquests? You're not a virgin. (off his look) Are you really? He sounds Dutch. Let me guess -- You do love your symbols. It has crossed my mind. I was thir-- Sorry. Please, continue... But I... didn't save it. Are you saying -- Wait a minute. Are you only doing this so I'll kiss you? Cause I'd totally kiss you either way. Seriously... why are you doing this? Are you out of your mind? It's too much, Haze. We can't accept something like that from a virtual stranger. He's not a stranger. Really? Don't be gross. It's still "no," I'm afraid. Can we at least ask Dr. Maria? You said the PET scan was encouraging! They have doctors in Amsterdam. And cancer. Someone will know what to do. (turns to her Mom) So you'll come too. What? The Genies can hook it up. They're loaded. You've never been to Amsterdam, have you Mom? Hello. Hi. You're ok, Hazel. Would you like to see your parents? They thought it was a brain tumor. So what happened? The usual. Fluid in the lungs, preventing oxygenation. They put that in... Drained a liter and a half last night. This is just a thing Hazel. It's a thing we can live with. Um, I feel like I'm not the most qualified person to answer that. Can't I just get like a lung transplant or something? (through the tears) Are you ready, sweetie? I won't be a mom anymore. I have a question. Can I still go to Amsterdam? Why not? Why not, Dr. Simmons? So does going to the mall -- They have oxygen on airplanes. It's my life, right? I have this opportunity I may never have again. If the medicine's working, I don't see why -- Look, I don't know any other way to say this... You're just too sick. We'll be right outside. Hi Augustus. Kind of. I don't know. I want to go to Amsterdam. And I want him to tell us what happens after the book and I don't want my particular life and also the sky is making me sad and there's this old swing set that my Dad made for me when I was a kid. It's just... everything. Thanks for coming over. It's not about Amsterdam. It's about me. It's about... Exactly. That's why I don't have a hamster. "Swing Set Needs Home." "Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks Butts of Children." No? Of course I like him. It's complicated. Mom? Mom! What is it, what's wrong?! Sorry, I... I didn't know you were in the shower. Bath. I was just... just trying to take a bath for five seconds. What's the matter? Did you ever call the Genies to tell them the trip is off? I just got an email from Peter Van Houton's assistant. She still thinks we're coming. What? I'm not supposed to tell you until your father gets home. We're going to Amsterdam. (still not believing) Really... Dr. Maria called last night and made a convincing case that you need to live -- I'm getting back in the tub now. (whispering to her lungs) One week, lungs. Keep your shit together one more week... Amsterdam! Amsterdam! For what? Mom? We can't eavesdrop, Hazel. Ok...? Ok. Amsterdam! (with some difficulty) Amsterdam! Oh that's not necessary. What's in your nose? It's called a Cannula. These tubes give me oxygen and help me breathe. Jackie... Oh, I'm sorry. No, no. It's alright. Would they help me breathe too? I dunno. Wanna try? Tickles. Right? I think I'm breathing better. Well... I'd love to give you my cannula but... I kinda really need the help. Thanks for letting me try it. I think that's us. Have you never been on a plane before? It's a metaphor. He puts the killing thing in his mouth but doesn't give it the power to kill him. Ok? This is what it feels like to ride in a car with you. (not looking up from her We're just friends, Mom. We're from Indiana. Something like that. (to the Driver) This is Amsterdam? Good morning. Actually, it's five o'clock. How was the park? Never made it. Mom! What? I like watching you sleep. I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff tonight while you and Gus are at dinner. What do you mean? You have reservations at a place called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set it up. Very fancy according to the Book. And romantic. Mom... I'm just saying... A 16 year old girl running free with an older boy on the streets of a foreign city famous for its vice and debauchery... is totally cool with you. Is that what you're saying? (beat, excited) Let's get you dressed! (calling to the bathroom) Hazel! Gus is here. Looking sharp. Am I under-dressed? Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters. The champagne is our gift. Ok. Wow that's good. Thank you for letting me hijack your wish. Oh my god. I mean... There are no words. I like your suit. That isn't the suit you wear to funerals? It's your death suit. I have one of those. Bought it for my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd wear it on a date, though. (cocks her head) Watch it. Maybe. Undecided. No. Well... Maybe I wouldn't go so far as to say no. I just... I'd like some evidence. What do you think? Really? Maybe there is no point. I hope you're right. I really don't get that shirt. Van Houten will get it. Trust me. There are like fifty Magritte references in "Imperial Affliction." "This is not a pipe." Exactly. But it is a pipe. No it's not. It's a drawing of a pipe. See? All representations of a thing are inherently abstract. A drawing of a thing is not the thing itself. Nor is a t-shirt of a drawing of a thing the thing itself. When did you get so grown up? I feel like it was yesterday I was telling 8-year old Hazel why the sky was blue. You thought I was a genius back then. Why is the sky blue? Because I say so. I'm so excited I can barely breathe. Please. I am sorry. Come in. Trash? Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never opens it. Um, no thanks. Perhaps some breakfast first Peter? I also think the Earth is round. Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made meeting you his Wish so that we could come here and talk to you. (looks at her shirt) Kinda. It was our pleasure. We have some questions -- About what happens, you know... after... the end of your book. Specifically to those who Anna leaves behind. Like her Mom, the Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy -- I would say... limited? (yelling over the music) I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak Swedish. So anyway... when the book ends, Anna's mom -- Peter! Can we please, maybe, talk about Anna for a sec? I mean, I understand that the story ends mid- sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue -- - but that doesn't mean her family and everyone she loves doesn't have a future, right? But you promised! Mr. Van Houten, you said you would tell us what happens and that's why we're here. We... I need you tell me. Surely you've thought about it. I mean, as characters -- They can't! (again, has to calm I don't want your pity -- Peter! Hey listen douchepants. You're not gonna tell me anything I don't already know about illness. I need one thing and one thing only from you before I walk out of your life and that's for you to tell me what happens to your goddman characters! Bullshit! Make something up. I have resigned. You're really not gonna tell us? Go fuck yourself. I spent your Wish on that asshole. I wanted... I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made him cruel. I thought meeting you would help him, if he would see that his work has shaped real lives, but... I'm very sorry. Perhaps we can do some sightseeing. Have you seen the Anne Frank House? He is not invited. I'm afraid there's no elevator. Oh, um, that's alright. No, there are many stairs. Steep stairs. I can do it. I can do it! Shall we? This is the bookcase that hid the Frank family and four others. I'm ok. The only member of the whole family to survive was Otto, Anne's father. I don't know how you go on, without your family. What? Oh get over yourself. I love you, Augustus Waters. "Get up you fat bastard." I said "get up." God, what an asshole. It was awful, Mom. You can't imagine. And then what happened? Then we went to the Anne Frank museum. And after that? We just... walked around. Sounds lovely. Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs a little. Give the two of you some time to talk. Um... ok... That was weird. Augustus? Oh no... Oh god. Oh my god no! I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so It's so unfair -- It's so fucking unfair! Does it hurt? Ok. I'm just... I'm very fond of you. I don't think you're dying, Augustus. You've just got a touch of cancer. Gus had a recurrence. You're not gonna say it? The usual. "Everything happens for a reason..." How are your eyes? What are you talking about? Augustus? (touches his hand) It would be an honor. How's your love life? Anything from Monica? She hasn't even like, texted to ask how you're doing? That is so messed up! How do you even know that? Ok now what? Woo hoo! What in God's name -- I am. How's he doing? What about the chemo? Can I see him? We have to be a family now. If you don't mind, I'll just hang for a while. What are you thinking about? Augustus... You are. I do know what you mean, I just... I don't agree. This obsession with being But I am mad! I think you're special, is that not enough? You think the only way to live a meaningful life is for everyone to love you, for everyone to remember you. Well guess what, Gus, this is your life. This is all you get. You get me, and your family, and this world. And if that's not enough, well I'm sorry, but it's not nothing. Cause I'll remember you, I'll love you -- And I just wish... I just wish you'd be happy with that. It's not over yet, you know. Hello? Hazel Grace. Oh, thank God. Hi. Hi, I love you! What? Oh, God, Augustus, I'm calling 911. I think it's infected... Gus, what the -- why are you here? Why aren't you home? Oh, sweetie... I can't fix this. I have to call someone. I'm sorry. Read you something? I know one. "The Red Wheelbarrow" by William Carlos Williams. (beat, tries to remember) "So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens." No of course not. Um... what else... so much depends/ upon a blue sky/ cut open by the branches/ of the trees./ So much depends/ on the transparent G-tube/ erupting from the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy. So much depends upon this observer/ of the universe... Hi, Augustus. I may have... Um... sure. Is everything -- I gotta go. Finish eating first. I can't, I have to meet Gus. You haven't eaten a thing. I'm not hungry. You can't not eat, Hazel. I am aggressively unhungry, ok? I have to go. Sit down. No! You have to eat, Hazel. You're not gonna starve yourself to death just because Gus is sick. You have to stay healthy -- I can't! I can't stay healthy because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am dying. I am going to die and leave you here alone and you won't have me to hover around and you won't be a mother anymore, and I'm sorry, but I can't do anything about it, ok?! Just leave me alone! You heard me? You heard me say that to your father? Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not something I believe. As long as either of us is alive, I will be your mother. Even if you die, I -- When. Even when you die, I will still be your mother. I will always be your Mother. I worry that you won't have a life. That you'll sit around all day with no me to look after and stare at the walls and be miserable or off yourselves or something. We're not gonna off ourselves. It's gonna hurt like hell to lose you I don't just sit around, you know. I'm taking some classes. Online. To get my master's in social work. You are? So when you're waiting for me outside Support Group or whatever, you're always -- Working or reading. If I get my MSW, I can council families in crisis or lead groups dealing with Why didn't you tell me? Are you kidding? Mom, this is awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my god! I'm so excited! You're gonna be so great, Mom! Thank you. That means everything to me. I'd still really like you to eat. I know Mom. And I will. I promise. But right now... I really gotta go. I know, right? So, um, what's going on guys? Late for what exactly? Why now? (looks around the room) How did you even get in here? Um, no. "Augustus Waters was the great star- crossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I won't be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears. Like all real love stories - ours will die with us, as it should. I'd hoped that he'd be eulogizing me, because there's no one I'd rather have..." (beat, composing herself) "I can't talk about our love story so instead I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 And .12 And .112 And an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and for that I am eternally grateful. I love you." He loved you so much too. It's ok, you hear me? It's ok. I was his girlfriend. There's a beautiful quote in Gus's home that reads "if you want the rainbow, you gotta deal with the rain." I'll be fine. Are you sure? We can drive you -- No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for a while. How did you even -- And you just... bought a ticket? You read your fan mail now? I'm so not in the mood -- Goodbye Mr. Van Houten. Nope. Thanks though. Have a great life. I remind a lot of people of a lot of people. She had leukemia? Like Anna? Were you married then? Well I'm sorry for your loss. You didn't ruin our trip, you asshole. We had an awesome trip. You think I care about that? I don't give a shit, Van Houten. You're a drunk and a jerk and a failure. And I'd like you to get out of my car right now so I can go home and grieve. Get out of the car! Occupada. He was really fighting for breath, I guess. He eventually went unconscious, but it seems like, yeah, it wasn't great or anything. Dying sucks. Happens all the time. Very. I know. I know. I didn't find it that annoying. He is not my friend and -- how do you know about that? Yeah well I'm over it. I never want to read another word of that asshole's again. What? I... I have to go. I... Are you...? Ok.
