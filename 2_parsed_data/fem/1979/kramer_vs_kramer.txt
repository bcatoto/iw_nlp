I love you, Billy... Sleep tight... Ted, I'm leaving you. Here are my keys. I won't be needing  them any more. My American Express... My  Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My  check book � I took two thousand out of the savings  account. That was what I had in the  bank when we got married. Here are the slips for the laundry  and the cleaning. They'll be ready  on Saturday. I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and  the phone bill, so you don't have to  worry about them. There, that's everything. Look, it's not your fault, okay?  It's me. It's my fault � you just  married the wrong person. Ted, you're not listening to me.  It's over, finished. You just don't get it, do you? I � am � really � and � truly �  leaving � you. No you didn't. You didn't even ask about Billy. I'm not taking him with me. Ted, I can't... I tried... I really  tried but... I just can't hack it  anymore... I am not! I'm a terrible mother! I'm  an awful mother. I yell at him all  the time. I have no patience. No...  No. He's better off without me. Ted, I've got to go... I've got to  go. NO!... Please... Please don't make  me stay... I swear... If you do,  sooner or later... maybe tomorrow,  maybe next week... maybe a year from  now... I'll go right out the window. I don't know... Huh... Hello? Ted, what are you talking about?! Ted, I don't understand a word you're  saying. Where's Joanna? All right. What's going on? Look, Ted, all I � Ted, all I wanted to know was where OhmyGod. Didn't she say anything?  She must've said something. Ted, don't be so hostile. Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot  and... well, she told me a lot of...  ah, things about the two of you. I mean... things. Ted, Joanna's very  unhappy and � What d'you know about how Joanna  felt? You went off to an office every  morning and you'd come dragging home  at seven or eight every night and as  long as dinner was on the table you  thought everything was swell. So she's late. What's the big deal.  That's just a way of saying, "Pay  attention to me." Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the  most selfish human being I have ever  met. No wonder she said you came  first, then Billy, then, if there  was anything left over, she got the  scraps. Maybe she didn't feel like she should  have to. Maybe she felt like if you'd  been paying any real attention to  her to start with, maybe you would've  noticed. No. Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I  know, I went through it. You've got  to believe I did everything I could  to get Joanna to stay. But I'll tell you something. You may  not want to hear it, but it took a  lot of courage for Joanna to do what  she just did. Joanna left Billy? She didn't take  him with her? Oh Shit. Oh, God... OhmyGod... What are you going to do? I mean, what are you going to do  about Billy? Look, this is nothing personal, but  I don't think you can do it. All right... Okay... But let's get  something straight, right now. I  mean, I'm sorry about what happened  between you and Joanna, but it's not  my problem, understand? I'm not going to have you calling  every fifteen minutes just because  you can't find a hot water bottle,  understand? I've got enough trouble raising my  own kid. I don't need another one.  Got it? You're on your own, understand? You're sure? All right. Who's Billy's pediatrician? Ed Davies. 230 East 76th Street. 472- 8227. Fifty bucks a house call, thirty  for an office visit. Write this down:  I'm not telling you twice. What's  the nearest hospital? Lenox Hill. 77th Street between Park  and Lex. The emergency number is 327- Colors in one pile, white things in  another and shirts in a third. Brush the teeth. Hang up the towel  and flush the toilet. That's all right, but I'm afraid  Billy was a little nervous... Goodbye, Bill. Thank you for coming. Mark. Say goodbye to Bill. It's very big... They didn't tell me  it was this big. Phew... This place is a real pig  sty. Don't tell me your troubles, mister.  I got enough of my own. The first thing is, I don't do floors. Or windows. I come in at ten and I  get Wednesdays off. What kind of boy is your son? Could I see him? Oh... He's very beautiful. Mr. Kramer, you are a very lucky  man. Barbara! Congratulations! When is  the baby due? Mr. O'Connor called. There's a meeting  with the Revlon people in the board  room and you're fifteen minutes late. Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures  on the television buy until Monday. Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to  meet on Friday. And Mrs. Kelsey called to ask if  Billy can come to Stephanie's birthday  party on Tuesday. Hello, Kramer. Sure. Yes. Yes, I'll have dinner with you. Kramer, I've got to go. I've got an  eight o'clock closing tomorrow down  on Centre Street. That's okay. It's just that I've got  these clients that are � Oh, God. Ah... Yes. I just met your son. He wanted to know if I liked fried  chicken. No, not really... I guess it's different if you don't  have children, but... I dunno, even  if Charley and I don't live together,  even if we're sleeping with other  people, even if Charley was to marry  again... He'd still be my husband.  That stuff about "Till death do you  part?" That's really true. Three. And add some basil. No. I don't think so. Look, I know this isn't gonna make  any sense, okay? I mean forget the  logic part... But I keep thinking if  Charley really loved me, he wouldn't  have let me divorce him. No, no, no, Kramer. That's not how  you do it. Look... ...you hold it like this... Farther down the bat. And you swing  like this... Throw me one. How about lunch, Kramer. I'm buying. Kramer... O'Connor's out to get you. He's going  to take the Fire and Ice account  away from you. You want to know why? I'll tell you  why... Another scotch and soda for the  gentleman. I'll tell you exactly why. Because  you're not his buddy anymore. Because  he can't count on you to sit around  the office every night until eight  or nine and shoot the shit with him. You dope. O'Connor doesn't give a  damn about Billy. All he wants is  somebody that'll hang around with  him every night so he won't have to  go home. All right. Okay. But tell me  something, Kramer. Who do you think  is palling around with O'Connor these  days? Murray. Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have  got to be the world's most naive  human being. Murray has gone in and changed every  single ad you've done on the entire  Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...  Every idea... Every single thing,  right down the line. Kramer, I'm sorry. All I was trying  to do was � I'm sorry, Mr. O'Connor is in  conference. Not for a couple of months. The last  time I heard from her she was living  in San Francisco. Uh, huh... She said she had a good  job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy. Uh, huh... Yeah... I told her you're doing a pretty  good job. How is he? Sure. What? Don't say that! I don't want to hear  you say that! Me?! You want me to take care of  Billy?! Hello, Ted. You look well. How's the new job? Yes... How's Billy? You can't tell it from a distance,  Ted. I've seen him. A few times. Sometimes I sit in that  coffee shop across the street and  watch when you take him to school. He looks like a terrific kid. Watching my son... Ted, I've been  living in New York for the past two  months. Ted... The reason I wanted to see  you... I want Billy back. I want my son. I'm through sitting  in coffee shops looking at him from  across the street. I want my son. Ted, listen to me... You and I, we  had a really crappy marriage � Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as  it was yours... Anyway when I left I  was really screwed up � Ted, all my life I'd either been  somebody's daughter or somebody's  wife, or somebody else's mother.  Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty- two-year-old, highly neurotic woman  who had just walked out on her husband  and child. I went to California  because that was about as far away  as I could get. Only... I guess it  wasn't far enough. So I started going  to a shrink. Ted, I've had time to think. I've  been through some changes. I've  learned a lot about myself. I've learned that I want my son. Ted, if you can't discuss this  rationally - Oh, Billy... Oh my Billy... Oh my  son... I'll have him back at six. Right. Kramer � Kramer... There's something I ought  to tell you. I've been offered a job in Washington  with H.E.W. I'm going to take it. It's a very good job � too good to  pass up. I'll be handling funding  for the whole... Look, I... ..."like" you a lot. And you... ..."like" me, okay? Maybe if it was  a year from now, maybe things would  be different... I'll miss you, Kramer... Six years. The first couple, yes, but after  that it became increasingly difficult. No, I did not. Yes. I tried to talk to Ted � my ex- husband � about it, but he wouldn't  listen. He refuses to discuss it in  any serious way. I remember one time  he said I probably couldn't get a  job that would pay enough to hire a  baby-sitter for Billy. Yes, I work for Jantzen as a  sportswear designer. I make thirty-one thousand dollars a  year. Yes. Very much. Yes... Look, during the last five  years we were married, I had... I  was getting more and more... unhappy,  more and more frustrated. I needed  to talk to somebody. I needed to  find out if it was me, if I was going  crazy or what. But every time I turned  to Ted � my ex-husband, he couldn't  handle it. He became very... I don't  know, very threatened. I mean,  whenever I would bring up anything  he would act like it was some kind  of personal attack. Anyway, we became  more and more separate... more and  more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I  had to leave. And because of my ex- husband's attitude � his unwillingness  to deal with my feelings, I had come  to have almost no self-esteem... At the time I left, I sincerely  believed that there was something  wrong with me � that my son would be  better off without me. It was only  when I got to California and started  into therapy I began to realize I  wasn't a terrible person. And that  just because I needed some creative  and emotional outlet other than my  child, that didn't make me unfit to  be a mother. Because my son is here. And his father  is here. As a mother, I don't want  my child to be separated from his  father. Because he's my child... Because I  love him. I know I left my son, I  know that's a terrible thing to do.  Believe me, I have to live with that  every day of my life. But just because  I'm a woman, don't I have a right to  the same hopes and dreams as a man?  Don't I have a right to a life of my  own? Is that so awful? Is my pain  any less just because I'm a woman?  Are my feelings any cheaper? I left  my child � I know there is no excuse  for that. But since then, I have  gotten help. I have worked hard to  become a whole human being. I don't  think I should be punished for that.  I don't think my son should be  punished for that. Billy's only six.  He needs me. I'm not saying he doesn't  need his father, but he needs me  more. I'm his mother. Yes. No. No. No. No. No. No. Permanently. I don't recall. I don't recall. Somewhere in between. Yes. I... I don't know... Ah... I guess I'd have to say...  with my child. I suppose... Yes. We were married two years before the  baby. And then four very difficult  years. I was not a failure. I consider it less my failure than  his. It did not succeed. Yes. Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna  moved into the building. Charley, my husband, and I are...  divorced and Kim, that's our daughter  is about Billy's age and the children  play together a lot. So, I guess we  see each three or four times a week. It's beautiful. It's just beautiful.  They have a beautiful relationship. Ted � Mr. Kramer, spends a great  deal of time with his child. I don't  just mean hours, I mean good time,  involved time. He reads to Billy.  They play together. They talk all  the time... He is a very... kind man... a very...  devoted father, and... and... And Joanna if you ever saw them  together... there wouldn't be a trial  at all... Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Ted. I'm sorry... I just mentioned it in  passing. I never thought he'd use  it. Please, Ted. I never would have  brought it up if I thought � You heard anything yet? Ted. Ah, Charley and I are... Well, we're  thinking about... I mean, actually  we're sort of talking about maybe  getting back together. Maybe. I said maybe. What I mean is, ah... I don't think  it'll really work out, but Charley  seems to want it, so... Oh, God... Ted, I am really scared. Ted!... It's me... Ted?... Ted, I just heard... I'm so... sorry... Oh, Ted, I'm so  sorry... Ted, do you love him? Ted, do you love him? I love him too... I don't think I  ever knew how much until now. Ted, when we got married it was  because I was twenty-seven years old  and I thought I should get married  and... when I had Billy it was because  I thought I should have a baby...  and I guess all I did was mess up my  life and your life and � Please... Please don't stop me. This  is the hardest thing I've ever had  to do.. After I left... when I was in  California, I began to think, what  kind of mother was I that I could  walk out on my own child. It got to  where I couldn't tell anybody about  Billy � I couldn't stand that look  in their faces when I said he wasn't  living with me. Finally it seemed  like the most important thing in the  world to come back here and prove to  Billy and to me and to the world how  much I loved him... And I did... And  I won. Only... it was just another  "should." ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing  everything you did, everything you  went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I  love him, or how much you love him.  I guess it's like you said, the only  thing that counts is what's best for  Billy. I don't know, maybe that's  all love is anyway... Ted, I think  Billy should stay with you... He's already got one mother, he  doesn't need two... He's yours... I won't fight you for him any more.  He's yours... Only can I still see him? Okay... I think I'll go talk to my  son now. How do I look?
