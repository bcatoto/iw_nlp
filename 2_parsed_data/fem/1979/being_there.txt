... Evening, Chance. ... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance. I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again... ... Gobbledegook... You and your gobbledegook. You're gonna be the death of me yet, Chance... ... Unless those stairs are... The Good Lord's liable to snatch up two unwillin' souls at the same time if I keep on trampin' up those stairs... I don't want none of that... He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead! Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head... Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'! Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you! Well, ain't that the truth... Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you... Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance? ... I'll get you some eggs. ... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'... ... gotta go now, Chance... You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance... ... He used to be a big man... 'Spose he wasted away to about nothin'...  ... I guess I'll be goin' off to find me some folks, Old Man... I'm not batty enough to stay around this neighborhood any longer... Wait up! I'm goin' out that door first. ... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital. Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you. Oh, I don't think it was anyone's fault, David. I hope you're comfortable. These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before. ... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better? I see. ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor? Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated... Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you... David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know? Would you care for a drink? Oh? Certainly... Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand. May I ask your name? Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance? Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you? Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often. Did you lose something? Oh... Well, I'm very sorry... ... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch? I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events. I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times... Good evening, Wilson. Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine. Thank you, Greta. I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed. I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner. Good evening, Mrs. Rand. Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling? No headaches? You heard? Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable. Do you feel well enough for that? But, Mr. Rand... I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner? Stay here? Is that necessary? Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington. He's very intense, and internal, don't you think? Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...? ... Sometimes when I see Ben I could swear that he's getting stronger... Something that he might say, the way he moves, or a look in his eyes - makes me feel that this is all a nightmare and that he'll be better soon... It's just so hard to believe what's really happening... You too, Mr. Rand, you must stay quiet. Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner? ... Would you like us to notify anyone for you? Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask. I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you. Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles. Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us. ... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us. Yes... I know, Chauncey. He does...? ... Why... No, I don't think so... ... Good night, Chauncey. Yes... Oh, very good, Lewis, thank you. But, Mr. Rand... Yes, sir. They're ready for you to sign. Chauncey! Your leg must be getting better. Good. I'm glad to hear that. ... How did you like meeting the President? Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him. ... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died. Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend? Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps? Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him. I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also? Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with. Of course. Our greenhouse. Yes, so do we. ... I'm... ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey... ... With us ... ... But he's...? Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post. Would you care to take it, sir? I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey... ... He's such a sensitive man, so considerate... Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post. I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy. Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself. Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation? Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you. I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business? Typical - no wonder he's so close to Rand... Why, hello, Mr. Gardiner - are you looking for someone? I can't find Mr. Gardiner anywhere. He's in the basement. What's he doing in the basement? I don't know, Mrs. Aubrey. Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over. Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called. Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested. Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something? Chauncey... Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing. And Benjamin sends along his best wishes. He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching. I know you do - you and your television... ... Good luck, Chauncey. ... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background... ... Kinney, what did you come up with? ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got? Yes, Chauncey Gardiner. He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant. Gobbledegook! All the time he talked gobbledegook! An' it's for sure a White man's world in America, hell, I raised that boy since he was the size of a pissant an' I'll say right now he never learned to read an' write - no sir! Had no brains at all, was stuffed with rice puddin' between the ears! Shortchanged by the Lord and dumb as a jackass an' look at him now! Yes, sir - all you gotta be is white in America an' you get whatever you want! Just listen to that boy - gobbledegook! ... Yes, I am, Ben. ... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar... Good night. I said good night! He wasn't making a speech to us, Tom - he was talking to the masses. He was very clever, keeping it at a third grade level - that's what they understand... Who knows...? Maybe the government had something to do with it. Try again. Try again. I said - try again. ... Ben, really... ... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you? Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie. ... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older... ... Good night, Chauncey. Chauncey! Have you seen the papers? Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's. I know...   ... So are you, Chauncey ...   ... Do you mind my being here, like this? ... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be... I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...? ... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that... ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint... I know you are, Chauncey... ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love. ... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until... ... I do love you, Chauncey. Oh, come in, Maggie. Yes, ma'am. Chauncey, Maggie will alter Ben's tuxedo for you now. I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it. Mr. Watson. Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department. Eve, child! How nice of you to come. Hello, Sophie. And look who you brought with! Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner... Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner! Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley. Sophie, please - call me Sophie! You just have to let me introduce you to some of the exciting people here... Why, Pat Boone and his daughter may drop by later! It seems like ages, Mr. Ambassador. Mrs. Skrapinov. Mr. Gardiner, let me introduce you to our guest of honor, His Excellency Vladimar Skrapinov, Ambassador of the Soviet Union. Ambassador Skrapinov, this is Mr. Chauncey Gardiner. And this is Mrs. Skrapinov. He's doing as well as could be expected, Mr. Ambassador. He still speaks of the stimulating discussions he's had with you. Of course. Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you. Would you two excuse me for a moment? I'll be back soon... Only to steal Mr. Gardiner away, if I might.  Everyone wants to meet you. ... It's strictly rumor at this stage, Lyman - just something in the wind... I don't know. Like I said, it's just rumor so far, but we should start nosing around, see if we can talk to some people... Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman. Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion... It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort. I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey... ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you... ... Come in, Chauncey - please come in... I can sense that you've been through a lot, Chauncey. But one day, when you feel like it, you'll tell me all about your life... ... But, even if you tell me nothing, even if it's too painful for you to reveal your past... Oh, Chauncey... I do love you so much! ... You don't want me, Chauncey... You don't feel anything for me... Nothing at all... I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like... To watch...? To watch me...? ... Is that all you want...? ... To watch me...? ... But I've never done... ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...? Oh, Chauncey... One of those little things you don't know about me yet, darling - I'm a little shy. ... And I feel so free now, Chauncey. Until I met you, I never felt acknowledged by a man...  ... I always had the feeling that I was just a vessel for a man, someone that he could take hold of, pierce, and pollute. I was merely an aspect of somebody's lovemaking. Do you know what I mean? Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged. Mr. Gardiner. Mr. Rand would like to see you. It was very moving, Bobby - thank you so much... Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief... Thank you, Nancy. ... Do you think we should look for him? I wish he were here... We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him! I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey... There he is! Chauncey! Chauncey! Chauncey! Oh, Chauncey...! Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
