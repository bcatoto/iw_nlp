Where's the girl? I made our reservation for 8:15.  We're going to be late. Dr. Minakis? Thank you. I've written the number of the  restaurant on the notepad by the  phone. Zip me up, will you please? If we aren't home in two hours, it  means we've decided to go on to a  movie and won't be back until after  midnight. Is that all right? Sure. The children are asleep upstairs --  first door on your left at the top  of the landing. They're both just  getting over a cold -- so try not to  wake them. Okay. Do you have any questions? We have to go now. We're late. Goodbye. Will you please come on! Hello? Nancy? Hello, Jill? How's it going? I got it, Dad! Father! Jesus Christ! My father's in one of  his moods again. Male menopause, you  know. So how are you? All right. Are you over at Dr. Mandrakis'? Yeah, I've been here for about an  hour already. Isn't it a neat house? I guess... I haven't looked around  very much. Did you see his kids? No, they were asleep when I got here. They're really cute. So what can I  do for you? You didn't happen to talk to Billy  today, did you? Yeah, I talked to him. Did he say anything about me? I don't know what you did to him, or  said to him, or what... but he's  really pissed off at you! What did  you do? It's what I didn't do. Yeah, I can imagine. Do me a favor, Nance. What. Do you think you'll be talking with  Billy some time tonight? Prabably. I'm going to the library  in a few minutes. I just have to get  out of this house! Hey! Why don't Billy and I come over  there? He'll come along if I tell  him to. That isn't what I had in mind. You'll be safe with Billy. I'll be  there. Come on. Nancy, all you want to do is come  over here and get drunk. Who? Me? Who? Me? You want to see Billy, don't you?! I've got a lot of work to do. I don't  want you coming over! You know what your problem is, Jill,  is you're so straight. I really mean  that. You go to a private school,  you wear a bra. No one can have a  good time with you! You know, Billy asked me to go out  with him this weekend, and I was  really really tempted because I like  Billy... a lot... as much as you do.  But I told him I couldn't, that I  didn't think it was right because  you were my friend -- You are my friend. Yeah. I guess so. Listen, just give Billy the number  here, but don't tell him I told you  to. Okay? Okay. I've got to go now. Okay, Nancy. Bye. And thank you. Yeah. Bye. Hello? Billy?... What? Hello? Mrs. Mandrakis? Hello! Billy! I don't think this is very  funny! ...Who is this? Hello, I'd like to speak to Dr.  Mandrakis. This is his babysitter. Yes? Forty minutes? Okay. Thank you. Hello, Operator? Can you get me the  police? Yes! No, not really. Please. Hello, I've been getting phone calls,  every fifteen minutes or so. I think  it's a man. He's trying to scare me. That's right. No. No. He just keeps calling me.  Sometimes he doesn't say anything. No, I'm just the babysitter. Oh... What? No, I... You're probably right. It's  nothing to worry about. No, the people I'm babysitting for  might try to reach me. Okay. Thank you. Goodnight. Hello? I called you before... about the man  who keeps calling me? He called me again. No, he's out there somewhere. In the neighborhood. He's been  watching me... through the windows. No. I know he's there. Yes. Yes. Everything. Please, can't you help me? I'm all  alone. He will call again! I know he will! 555-0672. 3317 Oakridge Drive. But he never stays on that long!  Sometimes he hangs up after just a  couple of seconds. Jill Johnson. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Hello? I know. Who are you? I won't be here much longer. The  doctor and his wife are coming home  soon. Can you see me? I'm sorry I turned the lights down.  It didn't work anyway. I can turn  them back up if you like -- Don't? You've really scared me. Is that  what you wanted? Is that what you wanted? What do you want? You don't know me. You don't know  who I am or where I live. I'll get  Dr. Mandrakis to drive me home. Him  or the police. I want to talk to you. Leave me alone! A little action for your game? I wouldn't bet against you. My own business. Thanks for the light. Okay? Listen, mister, I've got my own money.  So, if you don't mind... Get offa me!! Look at him! Oh, it's you! What do you want? Look, I'm the one who should be sorry.  I didn't want that to happen. Oh, God! Look at you. Are you all  right. Where're you from? Sure. Sure I've been there. Excuse me. Hello?... ...No, I just got in... I don't know  if I can... Listen, I can't talk  now. Can I call you back?... Okay...  Goodbye. Look, you can't come in here. I don't think so. Not tonight. You'd better go. You can't -- Maybe tomorrow. I said maybe. I don't know. Listen, I'm sorry about this  afternoon. I really am. All right?  That was my boyfriend on the phone.  He's coming over. So please leave.  Now. Look, do you want me to call the  cops? There's another one down there. Who is it? A what? What do you want with me? I've got nothing to say about anything  or anybody. Have you got a badge? Why? He's been here. I don't know. He said he had no place  else to go. Oh, God... I'm okay. I'm fine. Okay. Sure. Save it for later. Let's go out and  get some food. Curt's asleep. He'll never know we're  gone. I used to see my two kids every  weekend. They lived in a nice house  with their father, outside the city. Now... it's been years. They're grown  up. I look at where I am now. I know I  could've done better, but... it's  too late for that. Well, you've got to keep looking, I  suppose. I wish you wouldn't leave me  altogether... I'm not a young woman anymore. I've  given up all my dreams of the future.  Now, I just want to make it to the  end. You know what I mean. Sure. Yes. Chocolate chip. Hi, Mommy! Well, look what the wind blew in! Is that all you ever want? Hi. Great... what's the occasion? What? Okay, see ya. And me. And me! No, I will not tell you a story. You  go to sleep now. And be good. Carol  will be here while we're gone. Mommy, will you come here a minute?  I want to tell you something. What is it? Come closer. I love you. I love you, too, Junebug. Goodnight. Sleep tight. Hi, Carol. Hello, Mrs. Lockhart. I saw your  picture in the paper the other day.  Congratulations. Ugggh... wasn't it a dreadful picture? They will be soon. Give them about twenty minutes and  then take a peek -- but if Stevie  sees you, you'll have to tell him a  story. Here's the number of the restaurant.  Call us if you need us. For police,  ambulance, any emergency like that,  just dial 911. You know that, right? Nine-one-one? Oh, sure. And just in case, I've written the  number of the children's Uncle George  and Aunt Lucy here, too. Okay. Okay. Here. Have a good time. Thanks, Carol. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hi. It's me. Can you come over? Ohhh... John, tell me about the surprise. I'm braced. What sack? Oh, sure. No, I don't believe you. John, what did you get? District Sales Manager! Regional?! John, I don't believe it! District  Sales Manager! Well, it's about time! Not you. It's about time they recognized you  for what you are. Does this mean a raise? How much? How much? You're kidding! And a car? John, I'm so proud of you. That's right. Eat your dinner. It's probably Carol.  I'll talk to her. Hello? It was him! Somebody call the police!  Help me! That man... Curt Duncan... He's home  again! He's got our children! Hello? Nothing's going on. Yes, there's nothing -- Everything's fine. Why? What's --? I don't understand what's happening.  What man in the house? Carol, it's Mrs. Lockhart. Answer me  truthfully. When was the last time  you looked in on the children? About forty-five minutes ago.  Everything's fine. They were fast  asleep. What? Sure. Hold on. I'm Jill Johnson, the babysitter  seven years ago with the child killer. Hello? Carol? Carol? Carol?! Mommy? Sshhh... When I got back to the phone, the  line was dead. I figured we got cut  off somehow. What's been going on? What are you thinking about? John, it wasn't a prank. I know that  voice. I know that voice. How can we just sit here? Nothing has to be rethought. And I'm  not about to fall asleep. That's what they told me before. John, I'm sorry to be putting you  through all this. Honey... Not so loud. You're going to wake  the children. Stevie... Stevie... Stevie, listen to me. Where did you  get this candy? Where did you get this? What man? John?... John?... John!... John!... Mommy?
