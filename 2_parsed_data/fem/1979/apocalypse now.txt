Were you with him, when... Men looked up to him... He died as he lived... I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him... You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this... If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was -- Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best. And you admired him? Did you know him very well?Then Philippe will have to kill all of you. You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much. Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order. Are you warm, Captain? But Captain, I mean -- cannibals. Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages? Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain. That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz. Yes. What's a big question? What will you do after the war? Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there? The war will still be here tomorrow. Cognac? You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son. May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
