Man, how many girls do you need? My name is Hope. This is Faith. Charity's in back. I don't know no Tod. ...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation. We offer... Hello. You want some information?What does that do? Com'on, tell me. What's that? I don't know. You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?Well, each time he comes in closer, like this. Well, a boy goes like this, see. You never heard of that? You ever play Chicken? He asked me. You going with anybody?Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she? Yes. I think it'll look better. Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit. Overpowering? Sam? Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric. Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right. No, that would be much too overpowering. Not really. But if you want me to tone it down... I like it, Mr. Van Dorn. I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.But then you'll forget about me. I can't tell you that. What happened? Did you find out where she was? So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit. My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money... Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville. Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex. She left you right? Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she? You wife isn't dead is she? I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life. Look, I really don't know your daughter but... On your own land? Do you live in a house back in wherever. I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same. Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around. Rot in hell, honey. He's busy now. Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer. It doesn't make any sense to me. If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me. I thought I was fucked up. You really believe all that? Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't. So it's already worked out. The fix is in? Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are? No, please go on. Fuck. Shit. Yeah, yeah, go on. What the crap? Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation. You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church? He deals in pain. Tod was. He was with Ratan. Tijuana. What do you care about? We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with. How important do you think sex is? Neither am I. Why? Are you a sex fiend? No. Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto. Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job. No. But does it make any difference? How did you get to be the way you are? Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket? You don't understand shit. 'Sucking off.' You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what? You can't even say it, can you? What rate? At least I'm a growing person. Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days. And your wife? Where's she? Jesus. Of Joanne's? I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you? You're not a private detective either, are you? You don't drink? You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something? Huh? I thought you were going to bed? This is different. This is nine hundred dollars. When do we start? Make it nine hundred. That was my best week. Up front? This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall. Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl. Are you a private detective? You're not a film producer, are you? Last I heard he went to San Diego. Tod might know. Nah. No. I saw her with Tod. Joanne? Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this. You making a feature? Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada. It's your money. You talk. Too bad. I wasn't in it. Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture? Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more. She thinks so. What do you do? You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight. Jake'll take care of me. I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway. You can fuck off, too. Well, he can just fuck himself. Who's that? My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica. Thanks. Was he with a girl? I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around. You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
