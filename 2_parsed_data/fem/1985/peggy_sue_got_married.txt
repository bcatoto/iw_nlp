Peggy Sue. Don't say that... Charlie... I can't. I'm too embarrassed. Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off. I don't know, just put it back. You know Charlie, if you're serious about this, I know a great vocal coach. Hi Dad, can I have 100 dollars for a brake job? There's something pathetic parked in front of my house. I'm still waiting for the mortgage check. Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here. That stays. I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them. I know. Put Scott through college. Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight? Bye sweetheart. If the pastries aren't here by nine thirty, call Monica and threaten her life. I'll be back by noon. Hi Monica. You just missed Mom. Sorry I'm late. My Bobo's back in town. Hi. I'm Dolores Dodge. We're taking calls today on surrogate mothers. Wombs for rent. I want to know how you feel.. Oh, Dolores. Carol! Peggy Sue! I haven't seen you in years. In all that time, haven't you at least tried another hair style? 1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun. You're probably the only one who could carry it off. Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve. This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her. r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call.. How do you like my hair? It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible. Who's the mother around here? Sometimes I wonder. Turn that off. When are you going to stop being so mad at Dad? How do you think that makes me feel? I have a lot of unresolved feelings about him. I don't trust him. Besides, I hate those commercials. I'm sorry I asked. We don't have time for another heart�to� heart. Here, try on the dress. But I want you and Scott to understand. Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies. Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go. Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think? Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask. Borrow?! This was my dress. Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say... Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie? Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced. Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town. I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change. Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today? I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people. You two look like that soap commercial. Which one's the daughter and which one's the mother? It was Beth's idea. I wish I had the nerve. And the figure. Arthur, please don't call me Peg. Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band. It must run in the family. What does? Peggy, would you find a table? We'll see you in a little while. Okay. I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you. I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this. It's adorable. Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now. He's not here. We're getting divorced. I can't believe how she let herself go. She was so beautiful in high school. Everyone's got a gold Rolex. I had this one specially made in platinum. Welcome to the singles scene. I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie. You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage. We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things. So he started having affairs, and you got depressed. You should have left here years ago, like I did. It's not the place. I don't buy that. Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust. After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious. Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business. Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently. Wouldn't we all. Madeline Hutton and Arthur Nagle were high school sweethearts. Married right after graduation, they're still together. In this day and age, that's remarkable... Maddy, Arthur, how does it feel to have missed the sexual revolution? What kind of question is that? It has nothing to do with the reunion. Spiritual renewal.. That's what reunions are all about. Familiar faces, forgotten memories, ancient dance steps and music...the great time machine. I never could keep up with you. I remember that dress. Rosalie Testa! I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school. You have an incredible memory. It's beautiful. Does it open? Yes. These are my children. But they're not babies anymore. I think you got married when you were three. Carol Pritchard Heath and Walter Getz were high school steadies who went their separate ways. After twenty years and four divorces between them, they meet again � Walter a successful dentist, Carol a mature career woman. Carol, why did you really come back for this reunion? Curiosity mostly. I heard you finally found a man of your own. Too bad he's married. Hello everyone. Richard Norvik? I'm Dolores Dodge with KARP Radio. Could I have a minute of your time? Hi. Peggy was a mess right after they separated, but I think she's coming out of it... It seems to be pretty friendly now.. Sometimes it's easier when you hate them. Doesn't it feel like it was yesterday? My husband's a pig. But my son's in social work and my daughter, God bless her, is in India with Mother Teresa. I don't remember anything about the seventies. Breaking up was horrible. I said we had a very special attachment, he said, so does a Hoover. I enjoyed it. Who's the one with the hair? Michael Fitzsimmons. I had such a crush on him. Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getzcan still dance. Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left? Who knows. Remember... Whatever Walter wants... Walter Getz. Sharon Norvik this is Carol Heath, and Maddy Nagle. My oldest and dearest friends. Sharon's married to Richard. Lucky lady. Hi. Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here? No. I asked Rosalie. She couldn't track him down. He must have been quite a guy. He was the only one in high school I wished I'd gone to bed with. The only one? Well, besides Charlie, of course. Peggy, would you please rescue Richard? Ask him to dance. Well... Yes. You go ahead. Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife. What was? You're a sweet man, Richard. You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while. They're waiting. Come on. I can't. It's all too much. Go on. You can do it. Thank you.. Thank you very much. Would you like your Twinkie now? Charlie! Am I dead? Young man, stop that. I think it's time for your next class - Lie back down and take a deep breath. What's going on? Where am I? You passed out for a moment. Nothing to worry about. How did I get here? Why don't you let your friends help you? Take her into the washroom and splash some cold water on her face. That should perk her up. Yes, ma' am. Wanna smoke? No thanks. I gave them up years ago. Where is it? Were taking you back to the nurse. Maddy, what did you do to your hair? We're going to take you home. That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way. I'll call you Later. Yes. Let's stay in touch. Who is it? Peggy. Peggy Sue. Come on in. It's open. Mom! The nurse called and said you'd be coming home. I have a note. How do you feel? I'm excused. Why don't you go lie down for a while. Mom! Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home. Of course, dear. You're home now. I'm home now. Okay, I'm alone now. Is anyone here? No. This is crazy. Is somebody going to tell me what's going on? Why me? What happened? You don't have to show up. I don't have to see you. Just send me a sign. Thanks a lot. 1 guess I'm on my own. Nancy! Come here. What are you doing? I'm just happy to see you. Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me. I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life. Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest. Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders? Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do? It's unbelievable. The man never ages. Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great. Don't eat the red ones. Why not? They're my favorite. They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. (red dye *2) Can't hurt. I'm already dead. Peggy Sue! Hurry up. Fabian! I put your laundry on your beds. Don't forget to put it away. What's for dinner? Meatloaf. Yeech, not again. What is it? Oh, Jack. Like wow! Wait till I tell Diane. She's always bragging about her father's Cadillac. Oh, Daddy. You were always doing things like that. That's funny! That's really funny. Just a little. I've had a tough day. Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles. Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light�headed. Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor. My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast. Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young. A new car. We can't afford a new car. You have four seasons, you have four slumps. Let's get physical!... Let's get metaphysical! Good morning. Can I borrow this sweater? What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up? Oh. I forgot. You're looking pretty chipper this morning. I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today. Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health. That would be impossible. Mom, is there any coffee left? When did you start drinking coffee? Oh.Ah...recently. All the kids drink it. I think I'm way ahead of them. Pass the toast, please. And the butter. You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself. DADDY�o. Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this. Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret? Well? How does Diane like her braces? Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him? What's the matter? Did you two  have a fight?. Sort of. What about? The house payments. Pretty strange. Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years. You drive like a maniac! Oh yeah? Refresh my memory. Maybe I blocked it out. Why wait? They'll learn to live with it. Would you? Where's Rosalie Testa? Probably at the diving meet. Did you study for the test? Test? Mr. Snelgrove, I happen to know that in the future, I will never have the slightest use for algebra. And I speak from experience. Mr. Gilfond, can I talk to you? I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your class. You taught me a lot and... you're a very fine teacher. Thank you. Um, I also think you're underpaid. What do you mean? I was there. She told the creep off right to his face. Arthur, please don't call me Peg. I don't get it. That's because you' re not a total moron like they are. It's some stupid old movie thing they just started. I'll be right back. Congratulations on the math contest, Richard. Get lost you macho shmuck. I have to talk to you. It's very important. It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please? Therefore, the key to a successful children's party can be summed up in one word � planning.. With proper planning, a successful, inexpensive happy birthday party can be had by all. Including the mother. That was very comprehensive, Madeline. Thank you.. Now... Peggy Sue, your topic was 'How To Choose A Nursery School.' Are you  prepared? All.... Okay. Sure. Choosing a good nursery school can be one of the most important decisions you can make. It will often determine your child's attitude towards education and schooling. Of course, the lessons learned are primarily social �� sharing, being considerate of others. And they're so cute when they're little. They bring you back their Little masterpieces every day and you put 'em on the refrigerator door. They're so proud, and their names are all misspelled. Scott would always print his S backwards, and Beth would make her sweet little flowers... What a girl. What a twirl. You know, Peg�Leggy, you're gonna get demoted to hall monitor - Thanks. I thought it had a lot of merit. Rejected, worthless, miserable. Good. What a great kite. I want to ask you a question. Do you think...time travel is possible? Sort of. What's that? Iknow what a burrito is. What's inside? So you think time travel is possible? For people? Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise? This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years. You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things. Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July I don't know. That's why I was getting a divorce.. What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died. Come on, Richard, I'm serious. Am I dead or not? What're you doing? No! I don't want to die! What if it's beyond science? What it it's God? I don't know. I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life! I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. This necklace is sapphire, it was my Grandmother's. Who was that man? It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today? It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch. Would you get that, dear? Sure, Mom. Hello. Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it? It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now. I'm sorry, Grandma. Peggy Sue! What is it? What happened to you? I had a dream that Grandma died. Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are. She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right? Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter. I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize. That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset. Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning. I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them. Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing? What do you mean? Peggy, do you know what a penis is? Stay away from it. She's distorted. She's almost a juvenile delinquent. Oh, Beth. Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready? For what? Maddy's party. I don't feel very festive. You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares. Enjoy yourself! This is the best time of your life. And the sooner you learn to handle Charlie the better. Get dressed. Where did you get that sweater? It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world. Right. I promised my mother. Charlie, how are you? Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen? Hi, guys. Why I oughta! Can you believe I want to marry that dork. Why do guys do such stupid things? You know, I never could figure that one out. I was thinking of four ushers and four bridesmaids. What are your colors, going to be? I'm thinking of pink and green. Look at Dolores. What a tramp. You'd be surprised at how many girls in school aren't virgins. Charlie really has a great voice. Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts. Don't get your hopes up. Come on, where's your enthusiasm? He is kind of cute, isn't he? Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are. He does? Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today. First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out. God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends. Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion. Are you for real? Touchy, touchy! I don't know what you said to her, but I wish I'd said it. Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik? He's trying. Come on, let's dance. You're pretty charming when you want to be. Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand. Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you. You really love me, don't you? Charlie, let's make love. A lot's happened since last weekend. I probably meant it when I said it. Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out? You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing! This is a mistake. We better forget it. I'm sorry Charlie. What would you like? Monica? Aren't you Monica Hines? Yes. Who are you? Ah... never mind. Can I have a coffee, please? And a cinnamon cruller. How's Bobo? Twenty cents, please. You're kidding? I was impressed with what you said in English class today. You don't? Maybe you're confusing his life with his work. The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today. Coffee and a donut. Hey, man, I'm a hip chick. Terry, slow down. Terry! Slow down. There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons. First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie. Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old... (inhales) Travels well though. You know, the world looks a lot better from up here. What are you shooting for? Don't you get along with your parents? They care about you. They're just a different generation. I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance. Is that one of your poems? I'd love to. Michael... you're as good as you looked. I envy you. You have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want to do. But forget the rat puke; write something beautiful. You know, this isn't really happening. Thanks, Ralph. Where have you been? I went for a drive. Up in the hills. It's not Charlie. It's me. At my age? Don't be silly. Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young? Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please. I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell. I think they're going to deregulate it. Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school. Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox! I'm not the maid! Way to go, Mom! I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here. I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me. Richard, take it easy. How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people? Give me some credit, will you? Wbat're you talking about? Sixty�forty. Okay, find yourself another vision. When do we start? Quiche Lorraine, spinach salad and a Perrier. Dry cleaners. No real change. Just higher prices. Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair. There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life�styles. Not for you. Okay, there's lots more. Look at that stuff. It's like the dark ages. This is more your speed. And boy, do I know this business. You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about. Oh.And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous. I'll be right back. Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful? The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll  see you later. You just think high tech. Woody! How ya doing? Nice to see you. What do you know about classical music? Charlie. About last nights.. But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand. Why? What am I going to do with you? Hi, Dad. Open it. I closed my Christmas club. I wanted to apologize for this morning. Quiet today? The hat business is in trouble. Yes. But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats. eyes) He'll win. You think this'll cheer Dad up? Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist. Please don't shout. Does everybody have to hear? Jack, I was just trying to help. Does this mean we're going to be poor? All right. What's the scoop? On what? How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores? She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth? I hear she does more than talk with her mouth. That's disgusting! Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eighty�six. Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts? Just what you underlined. You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair. Come on. What's with you and Michael? Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious. He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet. I bet Dolores told Charlie. That loud�mouthed little bitch~ Peggy Sue! You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie. Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants. But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type. I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once. I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun. Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night! Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon. Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party. Aren't we a little old for that? Sometimes you're so immature. Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think? Would they go over my girdle or under? Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather. Jack, I think she's got something there. And we won't just sell them in department stores. We'll market them in drug stores and  supermarkets. You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night. Isn't that awfully forward? We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come. Wrong, Dad. Your idea. Charlie. I just had the strangest dream. What are you doing here? I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride. You know I never could stand your sarcasm. And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you? Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over. I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy. That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet. I just can't trust you anymore. That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different! Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish. I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me. Hello, Grandma. It's Peggy Sue. Much better. How are you? I'm very sorry about the other day. Hi, Richard. Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging. Yep. It's going to be a law. I broke up with Charlie last night. It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time. For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode. Like what? What do you know about hypnosis? Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it? Peggy Sue Kelcher. Or, Peggy Bodell. I'm not sure. Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set... I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that. We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway... No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young. No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time. Yes, every day. getting spaced)  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen. I couldn't help it �� I loved him. Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself. That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back? God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here? Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out. You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you. Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta? What's pasta? These roses are beautiful. And so romantic'. Who is this Michael? Is he a friend of Charlie's? No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell�O. What does Charlie think about that? You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie. What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married. Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school? Of course I loved your Lather. I remember once being offered a scholarship to art school. But I turned it down. Why? All the college girls I knew were so well, dressed. I was worried that I wouldn't fit in. I didn't have the right clothes. I was so silly. But, I don't have many regrets, and besides, r don't have time to worry about the past. But Charlie. I hope you know what you're doing. But Mom helped. It's incredibly difficult to make money in the restaurant business. You have to get up at five in the morning to go to the market, you have problems with spoilage, employee pilferage, and just try and collect from the credit card companies. They take months to pay. Oh, I just picked it up from my dad. He's a wonderful businessman. I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something. No. Something else. I'm too full. Besides, it's a school night. crowd � clinking glasses) For everyone. Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah? I can't do that. I hate chickens. Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me. That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer. Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it. It's Charlie! Ssh. He's great. I thought I knew everything about him. What? How did it go with the pantyhose? Oh no! Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it?  Like leotards. He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit. Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man. Oh, you're both so naive. You have a point, dear. I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to... Good dog, Rusty. Good dog. Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better. Could you give me a ride to school? Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell.. I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific. What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group. I'd forgotten how much music meant to you. Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you. Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest. Just take a look at it. It means I care about you and what happens to you. Peggy, I have to talk to you. What's the matter? It's that jerk Walter. What happened? After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing. Welcome to the singles' scene. What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore. Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you. What's the matter, princess? Lost your prince? You know Dolores, there's a lot of things I could say to you, but you're not worth the effort. Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky. Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades! I beg your pardon? Take a long walk on a short pier. Have a nice day. Rosalie! Wait! What's up? I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous. Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county. I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself. I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing. But accidents can happen. Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics. Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop. You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis. It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out. You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here. I love you too, Richard. Thanks for trying. Forget it, it'll never work. Thank you. Peggy Sue! I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight. How would you like that? Fine.  Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel? That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday. You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died. I wish she hadn't. I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die. I'm not telling. Do you believe in all of that? I remember that book! Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something. If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday. But I'm remembering the future. Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last. My children make me happy. I miss them so much. Beth. Scott and Beth. I'm going to name my daughter after you. That never changes. You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore. Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do? What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting? It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings. He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late. Good�bye, Grandma. Have a good time. What does Grandma think you do at your meetings? I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. Has it ever worked before? Thank you. Ah... thank you. Do you have to wear that hat? Yes, sir. Fasten your seat belts. Here we go. This is never going to work. What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here? Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there. I'm not getting in that blue monstrosity. Let me got! Where are you taking me? How could you possibly know what I've been going through? What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice. You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless. I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie. I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that. Will you take me back to my grandparents? Oh, Charlie. Scott and Beth. Where did you get these? Who's Scott and Beth? Your mother gave me our picture. That's you and me. So are Scott and Beth. I know. Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed? I've got to go now. I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years. I'm trying. Charlie? Was I dead? You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old. Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you. What about Janet? Who are all the flowers from? It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him. Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why". You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up. Then hold me. Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell. Charlie, please, I need some time. Charlie, I would like to invite you to dinner at home, on Sunday, with your kids. I will make a strudel. I came to say goodbye. You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now. Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time. No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard. You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
