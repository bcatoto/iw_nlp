I don't know... I don't know... I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened. I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished. It's not my time of month. It's not that... it's not that... Yes, Mother. They were stained. I burnt them. No. It made them holy. In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins. Yes Mother. I don't know. I'm being punished. Of God. No I don't... the host is enough. I'm not hungry. But she watches... she listens. Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen. God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said... No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp. I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven. Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child. That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful. Look at the statues, they're thin. It's a sin to be fat. No he doesn't. He hates fat people. I do, I have to be attractive to God. Because... I'm a blimp. I am, there's too much flesh on me. Because I'm getting fat. No. She'd punish me. I can't say. Yes. No. I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can. I put her to sleep. She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake. Yes. Yes. Yes. I don't remember. It was dead. God! It was God. And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him. I hate him. For what he made me go through. I hate him for what he did to me. I hate him... Not your fault... No... Stay away from me... It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop. Let go of me, I wish you were dead. Yes. Yes. From the belltower the day she before she died. She'd seen him too. Him. So I could go to him. Yes. The statue. She had shown it to me the day before. She said Michael. Yes. Yes. Yes. Frightened. No... don't hit me please... Go away, I don't want you here. They can't hear me that's why. Oh God... I don't wanna... Of me. Oh... God! My God... Water... it's all water... I don't know which one I have to throw up... I feel as if I've eaten glass. Yes. For me to get sick in. No. A wastepaper basket. A crucifix. My bed. Sister Marguerite I think. Someone's following me. I left early because I wasn't feeling very well. We went to chapel for vespers. I hate them. Fish... ... brussel sprouts. I ate. I'm afraid. She made me promise not to. I can't tell you that. No. Yes. It grew. May I open my eyes now? Yes. Because I wasn't worthy. Because I was afraid. No. Yes. It came out of me. I had a baby. Of telling you. I'm frightened. Because I'm in trouble. To help me. Doctor Livingston. Yes. As much as Mother Miriam does? Do you really love me or are you just saying that? I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake... Yes I am. No I'm not. Yes. No I'm not. Alright. I'm afraid. She touches me down there with a cigarette. Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more. And then... Her headaches. Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby. She says my whole body's a mistake. Yes. Yes. ... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me. ... makes me... She... She watches... she listens. She can. Yes. I can't. No... I breathed! I'm always bad. Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her. Answer me! You never answer me. Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you? That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget. I'm not sick. Everything... I don't have children. I was a mistake. Not my fault. I can't help it if I'm stupid. If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... A mistake... it was a mistake... A mistake... From someone who didn't want to have a baby. Because I don't want one. Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby. I could never be a mother. Yes. She'd get angry. No, but I can never tell her that. No. No. An angel, when she was having one of her headaches. You'll laugh. I don't know. Somebody told her. She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away. I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew. No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep. Where did you go? Oh, it's even more wonderful then. I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head. Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end. Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things. No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died. She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that. She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful. I don't know. No... do you? Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes. Where do you think babies come from? One. No questions. Why do you smoke? Why not? Would you like some? Do you have any children? Would you like to be? Are you married? What's your real name? Anything? What do you mean? No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions. No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me. I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby. Don't you know? I... I don't understand. From God. No, they say it came from the waste paper basket! From their heads... What baby? Yes. I fell asleep. I got sicker. I went to my room. Down... there. Yes. Something I ate. No. I was sick. I don't know. I never saw any baby... I think they made it up. You want to talk about the baby don't you? In the confessional. Oh, yes. At least once a week. Yes. No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell. Oh, I know he does. Oh, yes! Oh, there are so many. Yes. I love you. Right now? Everyone. Yes. Love. God! But there's nothing to say about God. Yes. I don't know. Let's talk about something else. No I'm not. That wasn't me. No I don't. Yes.The bishop is breathing down our necks. The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us. Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law. Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison. Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.Who are you? I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood. And you believed me. You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God. Not any more... now I like chocolate. Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite. Who are you? Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.H... how? What did you do? And then... what did she do? Agnes what did she do? You saw it all didn't you? She took the baby in her arms? Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she? It was alive wasn't it? Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him. Agnes, who did this to you? Who? Yes. Of course you do. Who was it? Agnes who did you see? He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women. Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand? Agnes... Agnes... Are you frightened? So she sent you? Where? How did she know about him? Who? Why? And the passage to the barn? What did she mean? I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember. Agnes, can you hear me? That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand? Do you remember what just happened? Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three... It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel? Is someone in the room with you? Who? Why isn't anyone coming? Of what? Which one? What do you do? What do you feel? Are you ill? What do you think it's there for? Do you know who put it there? Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it? What else? Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby? Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night. Who? What is it? Hm hmm. And then what happened? You don't like brussel sprouts? Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner? Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed. Who? Who made you promise? It's alright Agnes. It's alright. Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick. Will she be angry? Did anyone else know about the baby? Would you like to tell me? What made it grow? Do you know? No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you? Why? To be a mother? Why were you afraid? Why? Did you want it to come out? Did you know what was going to come out? How did you have a baby? But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble? Of what? What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble Agnes? Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here? And why am I here? Who am I? You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me. As much as God loves you. I really love you. Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you. You're a mistake. Are you intelligent? Agnes, you're stupid. Are you pretty? Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Please! I want to help you. Let me help you. Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright? What? Oh, yes. How does she know that? Why? That you're a mistake? And that you're stupid? She tells you you're ugly? Yes? Yes? Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her. How? She can't hurt you any more. She's dead isn't she? You can tell me. Agnes. What did your mother do to you? If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you? Did she make you do something you didn't want to? Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it? Did it embarrass you? Did it... did it hurt you? What did she make you you do? What did you do? What did you do? Sometimes, yes. Agnes... And you're unhappy. But you're troubled... aren't you? Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you. Agnes... What the child? ... and that you don't believe you carried a child. ... that you don't remember getting pregnant... Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex... Is that what she said? Agnes, how did your mother get you? How would that person get one if they didn't want one? Like you? If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one? Why not? Why not? Did you ever want to be a mother yourself? Agnes, did you love your mother? Why not? Mmm? Do you believe she really saw them? Do you? Did your mother see angels often? I promise I won't laugh. Who told her? Agnes... Who? How did she know that? What things? You have trouble sleeping? Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else? It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl. What happens if the bell rings and you're under there? Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down. I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head? Like what? No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies? Sister Paul was in her eighties? Did she climb up here often? What else did she tell you? You liked Sister Paul? Why should I? Do you know a Marie? From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know. What? Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions? Does it bother you? I've stopped menstruating I can't have them any more. No. Not at the moment, no. No. Martha Louise Livingston. Anything. Just that... you ask and I'll answer. Would you like to ask them? Agnes... Then let's talk about something else... Yes I do, but I want you to... Agnes, how are babies born? After God... before the waste-paper basket. Where'd it come from before that? Is that where they say it came from... ? The baby they made up. Where did the baby come from? In the middle of all the pain? And then what? And what happened? And what did you do? Where? Did it hurt? How were you sick? Do you remember the night they said it came? Why should they? Would you like to talk about it? Where do you meet? And you like that? Often? You've been alone together? He's told you? Do you think he loves you? Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau? Who? Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ? Uh huh. Well, who in particular? Who? Have you ever loved anyone? Second thing that comes to your mind. First thing that comes to your mind? Anything... may I sit down? What would you like to talk about. Hasn't anyone ever told you that before? Was it Sister Marguerite? I just heard you. You have a lovely voice. Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I? Sister... What? Agnes? Who? Mother Superior? And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be? Why? No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit. Eve, she strangled a baby! Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here. Thanks. Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be. Larry... I don't know. Something they... that they overlooked. Larry there's got to be something missing. Larry... Thanks... Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will. I can get you new evidence next week. Next week. I'll have it. Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby. I'll have a decision by next week. Yes, that's because I'm getting to her. All I want is one more week. I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this. Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here. What about Roger? He's free. I... I'm Martha, Mama. Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me! Marie's dead Mama. Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right? I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite. It's Martha, Mama. There you go. It's your favourite... Hello, Mama ... brought you something. Uh huh. The one up on the third floor? Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room? Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you? How do you survive? I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..? Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to... What business is it of yours..? Who told you this? What does this have to do with..? Why do you call it an investigation? I never have. No. Wasn't it! What happened to the baby? Agnes, what happened to the baby? I doubt that's what she'd say. Before or after you killed the child? You tied the cord around its neck. And the baby. You hid the wastepaper basket in her room. You wanted that child out of the way. You went to the room to help with the birth. The baby? Too late for what? For what? An abortion? And you didn't send her to a doctor. Did you know she was pregnant? Was it you? Who knew she was pregnant? I have a few more questions to ask her. Where is she? Who was that person Mother? Was it you? Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room. Oh, would you stop lying Mother! Somebody told her. There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out. That's what I have to believe... But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line. But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing. I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother? But how did it happen? You're saying God did it? This is insane. Well give me a reasonable explanation How ? My God, you're as crazy as... Who is he? How? How? She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle. You think she's a saint? For the Church? One that will ask the questions you want asked. You're what? NO... no... I said leave her alone. Of course. No. The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove? I'd like to begin. Do you think Agnes is still attached to God? Well you can try, can't you, to be good? Do you want to become one? Do you think they ever existed? Right. What do you suppose today's saints are smoking? Oh, you've come a long way baby. Right... Saint Peter? Hand rolled. Long, thin and filtered. Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then? All right? Would you like one? Huh? My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. Does my smoking bother you? No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles. I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me? I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston. That's all? That's enough! She was a beautiful little girl. It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said? She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers. Nothing... You just said... Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality... Bullshit! Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh? An unhappy woman... I don't give a damn about her spiritual health. The woman's health is at stake. Don't deny it! I'd like yours too. Oh, God. Why didn't you do anything to stop her? Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic. There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets. She molested her! Do you know what she did to her? Listening to angels? Like keeping her home from school? And Agnes' father? No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it? Your niece! You lied to me Sister Paul? When was that? What sheets? What is it? Was the child full term? Take at look at it. Do you have a... a diary or a day book? Visitors to the convent. Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time? When would Agnes have conceived the child? Answers. Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court. Aquittal. There's another choice. No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world. Then help her. ??? ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by. And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God... ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant... ... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are? You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child. How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured... How dare you tell me to run my affairs! I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church. I hate ignorance and stupidity. What? And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it? It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim. Not simple, no. She has it now. She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand! She could have bled to death. Why didn't you take her to a doctor? This was before her pregnancy? And what happened? And you weren't shocked? When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks? Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him. That possibility never occurred to you? One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal. It's possible isn't it? That she was unconscious, yes! So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the... And in your eyes? So, someone else could have done it. If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child? That's ridiculous... How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth? From other nuns... Yes I... I've noticed. What's your opinion? I am not with the Inquisition. The science of psychiatry. Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here. Why do you think that? Look, someone gave her the baby. Why haven't you asked her? And you didn't try to find out who? Could there have been anyone else? What's his name? Was there a priest? What man had access to her? Who was the father? Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time? How did she hide it during the day? Is that normal? How did she hide it from the other nuns? Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy? I can beat that. You were a smoker? ... Thank you. Yes... I...That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets. For what? Should you see a doctor? What do you mean? A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility. Say it! How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of. Why? Then tell me. Where are your sheets? It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets? Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin? We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister. Why? Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true? Dear Jesus... Why? Yes, of God. My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything. You've got to eat something Agnes. Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat. Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead. Who? Oh my dear child. Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where... That's not what he meant. Who tells you these things? Agnes... Why? Who told you this? He loves you the way you are. ... You needn't worry about being attractive here. Why does it matter whether you're fat or not... Agnes... Oh, for Heaven's sake. Who? One of the other Sisters? Why? Who? Through someone else? He talked to you Himself? Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES I've been commanded by God. Oh, don't do this! She can't remember. That's enough. Then she's a liar. I left it with her and I went for help. I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked. No! I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets. That's a lie. She didn't want any help. The scandal... I don't know... too late to stop it. Oh, don't be ridiculous. I didn't guess until it was too late. Yes. Is it because she's a nun? Why do you insist upon pressing... My God, but you're determined. Hasn't she had enough? This is permission to take her apart. If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes. I'm concerned about her health. Why would I lie? Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years. That's crazy. How could she find out about it? Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her? You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why? That's what you believe she is? The sum of her psychological parts? She is an innocent. But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe. You'll never find the answer for everything God did. There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out. A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb? Don't be ridiculous. Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying... Why must he be anybody? The father! She's been touched by God, yes. For Agnes. One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect. If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case. Stop this, she'll hurt herself I'm not going to allow this. Then let's begin. May I be present? Would it stop you if I did? Begin what? Listen to her singing. Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth. No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles. Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles. Become? One is born a saint. Yes I do. There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking. And Saint John would chew tobacco. Mary Magdelen? Pipe! Even Christ would partake socially. Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet. And of course Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More... Fine thanks... I'm out of prac... ... practice. I'd love one. No, it reminds me. So you left the Church because you had freckles? And what has that to do with it? Stupid woman... and that's all? What have we done to hurt you? And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do? Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin? What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you? Who said anything about the Catholic Church... Bullshit yourself! Because I am a moral person. She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone. I know you don't. Her spiritual health. I haven't decided yet. We'll see about that. And my permission? Because I didn't know... I knew that after the fact. Oh God, if only I'd known. Oh, dear God. I don't think I care to know. She drank too much. That's what killed her. Yes. I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened. I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important. About what? Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room. The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away. Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed... The sheets... Oh, Dear God... There's nothing here. Yes. Nothing. Earthquakes? Oh, some time in January. All right, what do you need. How? What? What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin. I am... I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. ??? She is not a child. I'm only interested... It's my affair too. Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else... The Catholic Church... Nuns... you hate nuns. You hate us don't you? God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God. I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that? I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple. But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that. It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again... About two years before. She stopped eating completely... I was appalled, just as you are now. Shortly after she came to us. Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made. This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark. No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes. That's absurd! Who? You don't really believe something like that happened do you? I've already told you what I thought. No... not in the eyes of the police. She didn't! This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her. In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book. Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God. From other people! I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying. I believe Agnes is different. Well... what do you think? Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar. And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are! I don't want that mind cut open. Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination. Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally... Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient. Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial. She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception? Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes. Obviously there was. Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate. Yes, but I... None as far as I know. I haven't a clue. We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits. She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to. Yes. She undressed alone... she bathed alone. No-one. Unfiltered. Two packs a day. You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters. You can call me Sister. I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...Yes. Oh that one there, in the corner. No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public. Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves, some wheat, corn, some vegetables. The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
