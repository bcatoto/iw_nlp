I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you. Not mine, stupid. Yours. God, I haven't seen you since the wedding. John Ultramalensky, right? I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I? Where are you going?Till then. Cash. I'm impressed. This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages. That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars. You may be right. I agree. You should have proved that in a court of law. I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out. Until she remarries, Fletch. I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence. You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars. I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband. Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.Who's Frieda? And, I'm sorry, who are you again? Jim Swarthout?I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.' I want to hear this. Don't worry, I can take it. I'm terrified. Don't tell me I can't -- I'm calling the police. Right now. Bastard. Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist??? What is this.... Oh God, I hate things that start like that.... I've never lied to him before. It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.' But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking. I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today. I was afraid you'd say that. Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours? What are you talking about? No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill... Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know. Stop it. Are you saying my husband is defrauding me? But I've seen the deed. Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in -- What does all this mean? How do you know about that? What are you talking about? So? Who. I'll cover it. You have any other surprises? A four hundred dollar lunch tab! Why did you do it? I think you should call me Gail, now. What is this? He never sees them and I never met them. Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there. Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom. Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry. No. I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else. Depends on the question. Just like Alan. It's freaky. Your bone structure, shoulders, neck... It's amazing. You were in the war? All this goes on Underhill's bill? God... Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you? I mean put clothes on. I really should change. Down boy. You ordered it here? I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want? Uh... I'm just out of the shower. Hi. John Ultramalensky? Who is it? None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off. See what I mean? If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman. Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you? Alan's in Utah. I bet you do. Stay! I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player. I love the outfits. Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one! What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied. Damn, I thought I had that one. Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little. That's a strange combination. Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really. John who? John! You used to fly together! Oh, mine! Thank God. Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's? I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are. In a minute! I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute? You don't know the Underhills? John! Yes?I guess not. That's it. Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here. Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign. Is there anything particular you're looking for? Here you are, Doctor. Yes, right away. Oh my God! Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted. Can I get you something? You're in the Records Room. Are you all right, Doctor? Nothing. They're still there.Will you kill me? What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service. That's right. Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else. I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent. It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent. Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM. LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you. Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment. Do you have a passport? Get me on the first shot, if you can. Precisely. Are you a good shot? Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray. In this drawer.... I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets. I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off. These will be open. I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will. Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you. You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks. My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not. I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it. I want you to murder me. Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent. Come inside. Who? Alan Stanwyk. It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you. One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr... I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut. I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk. Because we can't. We can't talk about it here.How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party? Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception? She's cute as a button. Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some. Cute thing. His bride. Cute as a button. Cute young thing, too.
