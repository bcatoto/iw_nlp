The moon's not down yet... Sure, Uncle Al. I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either. Blue. This blue. Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters? If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters? Uncle Al- You're a real booger, you know it? Are you all right, Marty? Don't you touch me, snotbrains! Will you? Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains. Went shopping. Why? Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning. Let me help you up. What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed? I don't want your money. You're a booger. What's the money for? If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it. Brady's a booger and so are you! You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!I will- be good, kids. You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow! And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come! Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and- So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this. Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty? Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know. And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's- Rattling. Rustling. I've been hearing noises in there. There's something else scary. I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but... For getting a divorce? What's that? You booger.
