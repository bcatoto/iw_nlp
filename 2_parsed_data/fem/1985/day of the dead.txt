I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to... But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them! I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done. We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will... You are dying, too. NOOOOOOOOO! Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest. TONY....TONY.... Dios mia.It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on... We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly. Tonight? I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by... THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS... Sir. It's quite clear that... ...Captain Rhodes is trying to... I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab. Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is... You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it! Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned. If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson. Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright. You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH! Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!! You gave them a fresh taste of blood! You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat! God....damn you, Rhodes! I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and... I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland. I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need... I want you to leave. Then maybe... It's because of me. Some of Rhodes' men. At the door. Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.Come on. Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look. Look. What is it? No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know. Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him. Help me get him to the boat. How long do we have to watch him? It's...he was...one who came to the island with me. Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes. There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat. Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel! What? Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys. Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in... They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment. No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here! I can find it myself. I didn't come that far. Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic. Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch. We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet! It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain. Curse? The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth. Thanks. I can fight my own battles. We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns. Governor Dickerson? Of Florida? Gasparilla?
