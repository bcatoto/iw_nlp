Okay, by the numbers. Cusack. You were in charge here? And you were a principal in one of  the shootings? Where's the officer who was involved  in the other shooting? Did you? But you saw the action? And the kid was armed? And you saw the weapon? O.K. Ms. Partida -- Shut-up, Cragie. Partida has demanded a formal hearing.  You will be under oath so the  department will provide you with a  lawyer unless you've got your own. An OPS Review Board member is waiting  to talk to you. Doesn't sound like  you got anything to worry about. Kosalas, you work with Cusack until  this is over. Your right! You don't need a partner!  You need a goddamn keeper! Jesus Christ! How do I explain this  one upstairs? We gave you 600 man-hours, you took  a month planning the damn thing, and  what have you got to show for it?  Nine bodies? A dead informant? One  of my best men shot! For Christ's  sake! You're going to have me back on a  beat busting perverts in the park. Just what I need. A goddman war. Keep track of this business with  Cragie? I'll deal with upstairs. Just get me some answers, huh. ...you have the right to remain  silent. You have the right to have  an attorney present at all times.  Anything you say may be used against  you in a court of law... Now? No! Now? Mama! Daddy, would you get that! Bella. Keep 'em closed now. O.K., open 'em. Happy birthday, momma. Happy birthday, Molly. But Tony, why...? Don't do it, momma! Make him pack  his own bag. Listen goddammit! It's momma's  birthday! She deserves better'n this! You can't go now. Odell! Odell! I ain't calling you again! He's talking about you, Cusack. Pay  attention. You're all gonna have to  be qualified on this. It's the future. You're looking at the perfect cop.  The damn thing follows orders. Be back in a minute. What do you want? Your Papa worries about you. Get out of here, Lou. Leave me alone. Are you pitching? I don't know. You look strictly minor  league. I make it Eddie-The-Cop. All bad. Hey, what the hell do you think you're  doing? I don't know where he is, and I don't  really give a shit. When are you people going to realize  I don't have anything to do with my  father. I've got all the friends I want. What the fuck are you talkin about?  Nobody's gonna touch nothin. Just  stay put. I give a shit about their fuckin  parade? They wanna throw flowers we can fix  it so they're pushing up daisys. Where are you taking me? The hell you are! I'll take my chances. Eddie? What do you do when you don't have  anyone? Could you... Hold me for a while? Officer Cragie has already been sworn. Officer Cragie, you have heard Mrs.  Murillio's testimony -- You have heard her tell this panel  that she saw you lay the gun in her  grandson's hand. If it was dark, Officer, how were  you sure Vega had a gun? And right after you heard Officer  Cragie's gun discharge, what did you  do then? And what did you see? What happened then? Did you see that weapon in Vega's  hand before Officer Cragie fired? No more questions. I'd like to now call Sergeant Cusack. You made that uniform look good. You are his superior officer, are  you not? Did you give the men their various  assignments? Did you request that officer Cragie  be on your TAC team? Sergeant... I have here a department  document dated 24 September, of last  year. It is a request by you, to  your superiors, to have Officer Cragie  transferred to another unit. Are you  familiar with this document? Why did you request his transfer? What happened to this request? This is a letter of support for  Officer Cragie. Everyone in his unit signed it but  you. Why? Are you saying you do not believe  Officer Cragie is fit to work the  streets of Chicago? What the hell is goin on? OK, everybody. No more games. Where's  Cusack. Get someone in the air. We're gonna  find Cusack. That's Cusack. Hey, Cusack! I'm glad you don't follow orders.
