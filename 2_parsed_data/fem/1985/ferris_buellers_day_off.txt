MOM! I NEED A TOWEL!! When you turn ten, your head's going to swell up real big like a watermelon and we're going to have to put you to sleep like they do with a dog. WHO PISSED ON THE TOILET SEAT!? MOTHER!! OH, MY GOD! THE TOILET PAPER'S ALL WET!!! Wait! Hold still! You heads starting to swell up!! It's Ferris! What's wrong? For Christ's sake! Look at him! He doesn't have a fever. But he says his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots. Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy. He doesn't want me to. You're not going to school like this. Maybe I should call the office and tell them I won't be in. He doesn't feel well. You're not falling for this, are you? Tell me you're not falling for this. Pucker up and squat, Ferris. Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school. You're really letting him stay home? I can't believe this. If I was bleeding out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to school. It's so unfair. Oh, I wanna puke. Myocardial infarction? Get your stuff. Daddy'll be right down. Syphilitic meningitus? That would be a huge family embarrassment. If he dies, I got dibs on his stereo. Get downstairs! Now! A WATERMELON! Get downstairs! NOW! I'm showing houses to the family from California today but I'll be in the area. My office'll know where I am, if you need me. I hope you feel better, pumpkin. We love you, sweetie. Here. Here. He's sick. My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out at 31 Flavors last night. I guess it's pretty serious. No problem whatsoever. No one's going to consider a house with a black living room. Not even those jerks from Vermont. Let's be realistic. Joyce Bueller. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I completely forgot to call. Yes, I am. Ferris is home sick. I had a meeting first thing this morning. I should have called. It completely slipped my mind. I don't understand. This is all news to me. Nine times? I can give you every assurance that Ferris is home and that he is, in fact, very ill. I debated whether or not I should even leave him. I can appreciate that at this time of year children are prone to taking the day off, but in Ferris' case, he's truly a very sick boy. I'm really sorry about your brother. What're you sorry for? I have to live with the trouser snake. No, I mean I heard he's really sick. Who said he's sick. A whole bunch of people. They said he's like on the verge of death. This guy in my biology class said that if Ferris dies he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder? He's really sweet isn't he? Yeah, why? Hello? Who? Hi, Ferris. How's your bod? Oh, my God! You're dying? Is it serious? Shiit! Are you upset? With your bad knee, you better not throw anybody, Ed. He's very popular, Ed. Sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, pinheads, dweebies, wonkers, richies, they all adore him. Ooo. You sounded like Dirty Harry just now. Sloane Peterson? May I see you outside for a moment? There's been an emergency. Dead grandmother. Dead grandmother. That's what Mr. Peterson said. I had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane. It's so hard to tell. I see her alot with Ferris Bueller. Edward Rooney's office. Yes. Can you hold? Thank you. It's Mr. Peterson. Do you still want his number? Ed Rooney's office. Hold, please. Ferris Bueller's on line two. Huh? Oh. Um. Yeah. Very. She was a terrific lady. Very hip. Very old. Yeah. I guess that's my Dad. Thanks. See ya. This is so great! I can't believe it! Right in front of Rooney! Hi, Cameron. You comfortable? What a fabulous car! What're we gonna do? I'm thrilled, ma'am. I'm especially looking forward to wearing those jeans with the stretch panel in front. Actually, we're hoping for a car. Mrs. Froeling, how are you? I passed a kidney stone Tuesday. Say, you must be very proud. I met Madonna. She told me everything. Keep me posted, I'll want to send a gift. My son's home sick today. If you wouldn't mind, on our way back to the office, I'd like to just run in and check up on him. Of course. This is the Peterson's home. Watch your mouth this time. And her grandmother, too. We can't come to the phone right now. We've had a death in the family. If you need to reach us we'll be at the following number... There's a railroad strike. My brother-in-law'll appreciate it. My brother-in-law rides the train to work. Go piss up a flagpole! What could happen to it? Oh, please, Cameron. Do you have to be so graphic? This is so right! Oh, shit! What if the glass gives? Cool. Do you love me? I asked you first. Yes. Yes. Yes. Wait a minute. That was a lie. Sure. No way! I'm not getting married. What do you mean, why not? Think about it. My parents are divorced. So what? It's not like it doesn't happen ten thousand times a day. No. It's not something I can get comfortable with. I've tried. Are yours divorced? Do you think they're staying together because of you? Do they like you? Consider this...my father canned me and my brother and my Mom for a twenty five year old dipso with fake tits. He dropped us like a rock. Everything was cool at our house. I thought so. We all thought so. Then BLAM! It's over. It was pure selfishness. When I have a kid, I don't care how much I want something, if it's gonna screw-up the kid, forget it. Yeah. But I'm gonna try not to. I'm gonna think about it. I'm gonna try to prevent it. Well, you know what? It ain't up to you. It's out of your hands. You're merely an inhabitant in their universe. They call the shots. When you split from them, you call the shots. What? Commodity prices rose sharply today in unusually heavy trading... Cameron's right. We're gonna get busted. Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher. Ferris Bueller's days are numbered. I'm gonna bust his buns. Why? Because I'm sick of the little dope. He manipulates my parents, he does whatever he wants, whenever he wants and he never gets nailed. Well, babe, today I'm the hammer. Sweetie, it's an established fact that you have no taste. Ferris is not cute. He's not charming. He's not nice. He's not a wonderful person. He's an ignorant mule and the sooner everybody in this school comes to that realization the better off we'll all be. See? My brother strokes you, you sympathize with him, I get pissed off and this is what happens! Let me tell you something. I study hard, I work hard, I'm polite, I'm considerate, I'm friendly and fair to all kinds of people. Except morons. I try to be everything a good, decent person should be and you know what? Excuse me? Who does? Rachel? Rachel's a dirt bag. Who else? Forget that everybody thinks I'm an asshole? Would you like everybody to think you're an asshole? Oh, hey. That's exciting. A fat fifty year old clod with B.O. likes me. Would everybody be happier if maybe I were to die in a flaming car accident or something? Am I acting like an asshole? I this a conspiracy to shit all over me or something? Is my brother behind this? Tell me if he is or I'll sock your tits. Me? I have a problem? Alright. How about if I sock your face? If it means anything to you, I have my period! MY BODY'S RIDDING He's gone. He's over. He's monkey meat. I don't know. But it looks like it's already been eaten and digested. I wonder if he has a name? It is kind of raggy subject, Cam. Don't you think it's an issue because people need something to worry about? They have to like, have some major problem that puts all their little bullshit into some kind of persepective? To answer your question...No, I'm not worried about it at all. Yeah. Everybody's dead, it's real cold and the skiing's for shit. My step-father's always going off about how when he was young he was committed to all these causes. He says I don't care about things like he did. Baldness, fatty meats and money. Agreed. What comes after a nuclear winter? It's reprehensible to squeal on your own flesh and blood...but it's for his own good. His cavalier attitude will get him into trouble later in life...and it'll continue to piss me off and I'll get so wadded-up that it'll cause cervex cancer and he'll ruin my life. Screw him. Hello, Jeanie. Who's bothering you now? Is Dean Rooney in? I'm sorry, he's out. Can I help you? I seriously doubt it. When's he back? I don't know. He left the grounds on personal business. Can we leave now? You got a call, you broke your thumb, what's left to do? No wonder you're always sick. I can't believe my brother's making me put myself in a position where I could get expelled. Selfish little moron. Ferris? You're overshadowed me long enough. I'm gonna get you, buddy. I love him. Do you believe in reincarnation? Do you believe that you lived before? DO you ever wonder what you were? I'm not sure but I think I know who Ferris was. From the A-Team? I think if he was anybody, he was Magellan. You know, the guy who went around the world. I could see him ignoring popular belief and taking off on some impossible mission. SHAKE IT UP, BABY TWIST AND SHOUT! WORK IT ON OUT! The future's worse for a boy, isn't it? A girl can always bail out and have a baby and get some guy to support her. True, but it's an option. No options is worse. College. What are you interested in? Me either. YOU KNOW YOU LOOK SO FINE! Ferris, this is nauseating me. Really. I'm losing respect for you by the bucket. Who wants to get in? I'm not interested in watching someone jiggle their mammary glands. I'm not a tramp. I'm gonna microwave his nuts... Jump back, Ferris, Cameron's been a good sport. He's looking at me and he's licking the glass and making obscene gestures with his hands. Roast! I knew it! Is Mrs. Bueller there? Where is she? This is her daughter. Do you know where she is? Do you know when she'll be back? Do you know anything? The worm has luck like clams have body odor... If you're willing to commit a little time and a little money to this place, you can really have something to be proud of. Don't let the black living room throw you off. Well, Boyd, how are you bearing up? Did I tell you I have a son your age? His name is Ferris. I think you'd like him. Not that I know of. Watch your mouth. Do you know my son? This is not a phoeny phone call. There's an intruder, male caucasian, possibly armed, certainly weird, in our kitchen. My name is Bueller. It's real nice that you hope my brother's feeling better but I'm in danger, okay? I'm very cute, I'm very alone and I'm very protective of my body. I'd rather not have it violated or killed. I need help! What's next. We could go to my house. My parents aren't coming home until late. You okay? Cameron! Cut it out! What's wrong?! Ferris! Shut-up! It is a problem! For him it's a problem. Nothing's a problem for you. But it's a problem for him! So, just shut-up. What can I do, Cameron? I'm saved! Thank you, God! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank...you... I'll bet you never smelled a real school bus before. Gummi Bear? They've been in pocket. They're real soft and warm. Ferris? The water's really nice. I wish you'd come in. Cameron? I could flip real easy, too. There's nothing wrong with it. At one time or another, everybody goes to the zoo. What? What? What's so funny? No, thank you. I'm straight. Why are you here? I don't know why I'm here. Why don't you put your thumb up your butt? With you? Are you serious? Blow yourself. You really want to know what's wrong? Alright. If you've got the time, I've got the troubles. In a nutshell, I hate my brother. How's that? No, not yet. I went home to confirm that the shithead was ditching school and a guy broke into the house and I called the cops and they picked me up for making a phoney phone call. Why should he get to ditch school when everybody else has to go? I'd get caught. Basically. Excuse me? If you say Ferris Bueller, you lose a testicle. Really. God bless you, Cameron. Come on, Ferris, answer his question. I'd say... Love. It's better than "hello". You wanna be generic? This has to be a dream. Why? What about your one word? She's never been in trouble before. This is a shock to me. First, I don't know why she wasn't at school. Second, I don't know why she'd call you with this story about a rapist. I hope so. I appreciate your calling me. I can assure you that her father and I will have a long talk with her. Thank you. If you keep this to yourself, I think we can probably get it on pretty good. Hi. Don't "hi" me, young lady. Get your stuff. Jean. What's yours? I had a great time today. You think Cameron's gonna be alright? You didn't have an idea, did you? You're so smart. I LOVE YOU! He's gonna marry me. I know it. Thank God, you're alright! We've been worried sick! Thank you for bringing him home, Mr. Rooney. You better get up in bed tight now. Can you imagine someone as sick as Ferris trying to walk home from the hospital? Kids! Is he serious? Oh, shit! No problem. You don't have to. You don't have to. I've been ripping off your wallet for years. Hi, guys. Is my head swelling up? I'm sorry I've been riding your buns for so long. Ferris! Do you know a guy named Garth Volbeck? Is he cool? Honey? How did you get so sweet?
