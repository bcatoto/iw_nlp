Do you mind if I use your bathroom? Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise? You don't have to sing it. It's reply paid.I'm waiting for my daddy. Layton. Her name is Jill.Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up! I bet you'd like to touch them? You think these are tits don't you? You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you? But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now? Where do I get it stamped? Stamped? Yes. I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in. I want to report a wrongful arrest. What do you think? ... is it me? Take care. Don't do anything silly. Where are you going? Don't you like parties? Yes. They're gone. Your face ... are you hurt? Yes. No you're not! Oh ... Jesus! I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special. You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me? Leave me alone! Go away. Are you still following me? Yes. Come out, I know you're in there What? Shit! The house is on fire! We? Don't blame me! Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here! Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us! Let go! We've got to stop! Stop it ... damn you! Get away! Cut it out, Sam. I thought you arrested me. You're joking. Who will? What? Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day. Look at that - right on time. How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists? Who is this war against, Sam? Say, all wars have innocent victims. Why don't you say, no system is perfect. They couldn't be worse for the Buttles. We've got both. Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does? I mean, it doesn't suit you. No, really. What are you doing in Information Retrieval? A heavy Christmas present. What parcel? What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties. It does doesn't it? Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me? It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going? I didn't like it. I didn't run away. I left the flat. I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I? It's my fucking life. Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval? I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams! Don't litter my cab! Them? No. Who are you? Good! How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm? Who are you? Let go! Mrs Buttle, are you alright? Are you alright?I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ... Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please. We're meeting Mrs Terrain. You remember Samuel, my son. Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas. Not now ... please Sam!!! It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor. Yes he is - he wants to talk to you. Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here. Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams. Sam ... you haven't had dessert. Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval. By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens. What were we saying? It's something for executives. I hope you like it. It's very exclusive. Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there. No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body? What have you done with his body? My husband's dead, isn't he? Mistake?Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie. My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother? Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace. I know, I know ...! There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ... Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists? That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive. It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman. Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have? I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
