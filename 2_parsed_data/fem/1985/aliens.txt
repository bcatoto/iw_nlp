Terrible. How long have I been on Gateway station? Jones! Come here Jonesy you ugly old moose...you ugly thing. How long was I out there?  They won't tell me anything. How long? Fifty-seven...oh, Christ... No...noooo! No.. I've slept enough. We made it, Jones.  We made it. Dumbshit. Have they located my daughter yet? Is she...? Amy. I promised her I'd be home for her birthday.  Her eleventh birthday.  I sure missed that one. Well...she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt.  When it came to flight schedules, anyway. You always think you can make it up to somebody...later, you know. But now I never can.  I never can. You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate. I get the picture. Do you people have earwax, of what?  We have been here three hours.  How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story? Look, I told you... Then somebody's gotten to it... doctored the recorder.  Who had access to it? Would you just listen to yourself for one minute. That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock! Like I said. No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous life larger than a simple virus. I told you, it wasn't indigenous. There was an alien spacecraft there. A derelict ship.  We homed on its beacon... To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed over three hundred worlds and no one's ever reported a creature which, using your words... ...'gestates in a living human host' and has 'concentrated molecular acid for blood.' Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise... ...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching... That's not all, Goddamnit!  If those things get back here, that will be all.  Then you can just kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss it goodbye. They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case. Why won't you check out LV-426? What are you talking about. What people? How many colonists? Sweet Jesus. Half mine, dear. Knock it off!  I catch either of you playing in the air ducts again I'll tan your hides. You kids stay inside.  I mean it!  We'll be right back. Shouldn't we call in? How about 'big weird thing'? Mayday!  Mayday!  This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling Hadley Control. Repeat.  This is... No.  There's no way! I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it. What about you?  What's your interest in this? Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial. That's right. It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse. If I go. Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month. No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you. Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever. All right.  I'm in. And you my dear, are staying right here. You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not? Just stay away from me, Bishop! You got that straight? I've dictated what I know on these. Okay.  It's important to understand this organism's life cycle.  It's actually two creatures.  The first form hatches from a spore...a sort of large egg, and attaches itself to its victim.  Then it injects an embryo, detaches and dies. It's essentially a walking sex organ. The -- The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it... ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly -- Yes? Am I disturbing you conversation Mr. Hudson? I hope you're right.  I really do. I feel like a fifth wheel here.  Is there anything I can do? I can drive that loader.  I've got a Class Two rating.  My latest career move. Where you want it? How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant? That the atmosphere processor? The structure seems intact.  They have power. You bet. Wait!  Tell him to... ...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left. There! Burke! Christ, Wierzbowski! Over there. Watch it, Burke... Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure. They killed him getting it off. One of us? Come on out.  It's all right... It's okay, it's okay.  It's over... you're going to be all right now... it's okay...you're safe... Gorman!  Give it a rest would you. Here, try this.  A little instant hot chocolate. Poor thing.  You don't talk much do you?  That's okay by me.  Most people do a lot of talking and they wind up not saying very much. Uh oh.  I made a clean spot here.  Now I've done it.  Guess I'll just have to do the whole thing. Hard to believe...there's a little girl under all this. And a pretty one at that. I don't know how you managed to stay alive but you're one brave kid, Rebecca. What did you say?
