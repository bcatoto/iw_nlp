I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive. I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting. This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there. You haven't got it? One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code? You're late. You'd better be, Bro. You better be. Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside. How much time you got left? Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds. Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late. Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon. Yo. It'll flatline your ass. What are you talkin' about? Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away. Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not? Where the hell have you been? I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it. Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it. Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs. It's possible. The guy was a blank slate. He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear. That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe. It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend? You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape. Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you. Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying. That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web. Yo. When we're done, erase this friggin' tape. Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass. Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour. No problem, amigo. Never heard of him. Who got you into this? I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you. Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos. Hey, Kid... you expecting company? I can't feel nothing because I am nothing. Just playback. A ghost in the machine. What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?Case... are you okay? Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case. I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral. This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score. People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you. Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was. Hello, Case.My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me. Don't play with me. Take this off. No. I only needed the code from you. They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment? Let me get you another glass of wine. Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you? How's the villa's security? We did a pretty good job of pissing them off. A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume? What's an A.I. Easy... Hold on. You're out of time, man. What is it? My God... these people are insane. We've still got to find the mainframe. ...And if I guess wrong? Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom? When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it? Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since. I know. For Peter, that's a short trip. He projects with neural implants. Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera. Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show. So... did you get a look at heaven? You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined. Case... Are you alright? What's wrong? Don't like flying? Give me five minutes. I'll get the car. Yeah. Case... it's four a.m. Case... Put the gun down, Case. Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you. You okay? Okay fine. Let's get this over with. Dixie McCoy didn't. Won't that mean you're dead? Too late? A regular Fagan. So you're a wire junkie. What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high. If the splices aren't good, you could fry. You're not ready yet. They said two days. Go ahead... Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned. That's not going to help. Couple of days. They'll examine you. We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out. Almost two days. Hey... you're not supposed to be up. You've been calling her name. What's that supposed to mean? I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something. For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever. Couple of months. Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition. Sorry. That's not gonna happen. What is it? You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man. Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales. His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you. Shut up. How are you at riddles, Peter? Get up. Like what? Who? Peter... What do you think you're doing?
