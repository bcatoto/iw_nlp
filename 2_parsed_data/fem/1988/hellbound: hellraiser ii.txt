No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play. We've always been here. Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?Oh, I do. I do. You knew? Frank. Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet. I'm a girl who keeps her promises. Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go. It certainly is. She certainly has. I know. Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me! He... he loved me. No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick! Yes! Kyle, you don't have... Because I'm going to get my father! I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way! Get out of the way. You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got... What do you mean? What? The box. I need the box. Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway. And you're sure it was a woman? Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh? No bad dreams. Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy. I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised. Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help! I... I had a visitor. God, that's terrible. What's the matter with her? You a doctor, too? Well... G'bye. No. Don't let it. You've come this far. Finish what? What are you talking... You were ALL human! It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think! No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU. No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information. Wait! And what about you? I've come for my father! But I didn't open it! I didn't! The Cenobites. I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came. The mattress... The mattress... JULIA. He talked about Demons, huh? I thought Steve had talked to you? What are you talking about? Who are you? Steve... Where am I?It's been Hell. I'm scared. I've got to finish it. I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
