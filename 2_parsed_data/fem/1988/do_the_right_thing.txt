  Don't you have enough sense not to   bother people when they're sleeping?   Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day   I get to sleep late.   Good!  Leave me alone when I'm   sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on   my door, to keep ya ass outta here.   Do me a favor.  Go to work.   Good morning, Mookie.   Now, Mookie, don't work too hard   today.  The man said it's gonna be   HOT as the devil.  I don't want ya   falling out from the heat.  You   hear me, son?   Good.  I'll be watching ya, son.   Mother Sister always watches.   What's keeping him?   You call him, then.   Yo, Ahmad!   I coulda done dat.   Yo, Ahmad!   Punchy, if ya want to do some more   screaming, be my guest.  I'm too   through.   Punchy told me to.   Heard that, Punchy.   Peace, Radio Raheem.   You the man, Radio Raheem.   You ole drunk.  What did I tell ya   about drinking in front of my stoop?   Move on, you're blocking my view.   You ugly enough.  Don't stare at me.   The evil eye doesn't work on me.   You're a drunk fool.   Hold your tongue.  You don't have   that much love.   Hector, I shouldn't be telling you   this but you would find out sooner   or later.  Ya father ain't no real   father.  He's a bum, a two-bit bum   in a hundred-dollar world.  Your   father is to the curb.  You're   smart.  I see that look on ya face.   You're saying if he's such a bum   why am I with him?  Good question.   Like I said before, you're no dummy.   He talked his way into my panties,   I thought being a mother would make   me happy, make me whole.  He's a   mistake, but you are not.   The way I see it, if this hot   weather continues, it will surely   melt the polar caps and the whole   wide world--the parts that ain't   water already--will be flooded.   Don't worry about it.  But when it   happens and I'm in my boat and ya   black ass is drowning, don't ask me   to throw you a lifesaver either.   Fool, you're thirty cents away from   a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?   Don't worry about it.   You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat   the holes out of donuts.   I'll be back on my feet.  Soon   enough.   So when is all this ice suppose to   melt?   I hope it's not cold.   I counted the twelve dollars myself.   No tip.   Wait here.   Jade, you're late.   I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here   now.  Where's the stuff?   Seen your brother, just walked by.   This might take some time.   I got nowhere to go.  We haven't   had a good sit-down for a long while.   Tender-headed runs in my family.   You tender-headed?   Yeah, me too.   That's why I don't fool with it.   Only let you touch it...Ouch!   Sorry, comb got caught.   Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is   an old woman.   How are you holding up in this   weather?   I'll do.   I don't know why you still haven't   bought an air conditioner.   Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.   Fool, there's a lot in this world   you don't know.   You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it   isn't right.   I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides,   he reminds me of my least favorite   peoples.  My tenants and my ex-   husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.   Number One: I got some jive, late-   rent-paying trifling Negroes in   this house.  Every year I keep   threatening to sell it.   And move to Long Island...   And move to Long Island.  Number   Two: my ex-husband lost all my   property, all my money in his   scheme to build a Black business   empire.  Needless to say what   happened, this house is it, all I   got.  I'm too through with yar   people.   Whew!   Ahmad!  Put me down!  Put me down!   I can't get wet!  I'm not playing!   No!   Go 'head.  You got it.  You got it.   C'mon.   They looked good before he messed   them up.   You used to be so fine.   What was you saying?   Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.   Look at that.   It's a fucking shame.   What is?   Sweet Dick Willie.   That's my name.   Do I have to spell it out?   OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break   it down.   Let it be broke.   Can ya dig it?   It's dug.   Look at those Korean motherfuckers   across the street.  I betcha they   haven't been a year off da   motherfucking boat before they   opened up their own place.   A motherfucking year off the   motherfucking boat and got a good   business in our neighborhood   occupying a building that had been   boarded up for longer than I care   to remember and I've been here a   long time.   It has been a long time.   Too long!  Too long.  Now for the   life of me, I haven't been able to   figger this out.  Either dem   Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks   are dumb.   Old excuse.   I'll be one happy fool to see us   have our own business right here.   Yes, sir.  I'd be the first in line   to spend the little money I got.   It's Miller time.  Let me go give   these Koreans s'more business.   It's a motherfucking shame.   Leave him alone.   Shut up.   You're old.   He told you off.   I work too, but I still make time.   I want you to spend some time with   me.  I want you to try and make   this relationship work.  If not,   I'd rather not be bothered.   When?   Bring some ice cream, I'm burning   up.  Do you love me?   Big deal.   I'm in here.   How come you're not at Sal's?   Is this another one of your patented   two-hour lunches?   Sal's gonna be mad.   I think no such a thing.  Sal pays   you, you should work.   I just don't want you to lose the   one job you've been able to keep,   that's all.  I'm carrying you as it   is.   Yeah, then ya should take better   care of your responsibilities.   I didn't stutter.  Take care of   your responsibilities.  Y'know   exactly what I'm talking about.   Hurry up and get dressed.   I'm going with you.   No!   Hell no!  Goddamnit.  Sal ain't   never done me no harm.  You either.   That's not even true.  I just want   a slice.   What did he do this time?   So?   No.   I'll see ya there.   And?   Did you ask Sal?   Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be   disrespectful, but you can really   direct your energies in a more   useful way.   I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.   I still love you too.   Hi, Sal, Pino, Vito.   What's happening, Jade?   Nuthin' really.  How are you   treating my brother?   What's good?   You still letting Pino push you   around?   Forget about it, Vito.  Forget I   even brought it up.   Alright already.   What can you say?   ML?   What?   ML, hold this for me.   That's OK.  At least my moms didn't   name me Sweet Dick Willie.   Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?   Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.   I didn't say nobody, I said you.   Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like   that.   Yes you did.   I just wanted to know who named ya   Sweet Dick Willie?   It's just a name.   ML stands for ML.  That's it.   Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now   you know how I got that name.   Negroes kill me, always holdin'   onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.   Never too hot, never too cold for   fucking.   What's wrong?   You should be ashamed of yourself.   Eddie, is that the truth?   Eddie, you hear me talkin' to you?   I'm talkin' to you, boy.   What I tell you 'bout lying?   What did I tell you 'bout playing   in the street?   Get upstairs now.   And when your father comes home,   he's gonna wear ya little narrow   behind out too.   I appreciate ya helping my Eddie.   I truly do, but I'll have nobody   question how I raise him, not even   his Daddy.   Sal, that was delicious.   Thanks.   See ya around.   Stop tripping.   What are you so worked up about?   He's just being nice.   He's completely innocent.   I didn't stutter.  You heard me.   You are too crude.   Stop trying to play big brother.   I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta   nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay   your rent and you're gonna tell me   what to do.  Come off it.   Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your   little 250 dollars a week plus   tips...   ...peanuts.   I truly hope so.  I'm tired of   supporting a grown man.   Hi, Mister Se�or Love Daddy.  I'd   kiss your feet every morning,   that's how much I love you.   I think you have the sexiest voice   in the world.  All you have to do   is talk.   You give me fever.     (she moans)   Love Daddy, I'd work in Mickey D's   24, 7, and 365 just to call you my   own.  Give you all my money, honey.   Mister Mayor, I saw what you did.   That was a foolish act, but it was   brave.  That chile owes you his life.   Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get   happy.  This changes nothing   between you and me.  You did a good   thing and Mother Sister wanted to   thank you for it.   You're welcome.   What took you so long?  Is it hot?   Come in then.   How else was I going to get you   here?  I haven't seen you in a week.   Where's the ice cream?  The H�agen-   Dazs butter pecan?   Your memory is really getting bad.   And I really wanted some ice cream   too.   No!  No!  You won't come back either.   How long then?   That's out.  No!  It's too hot!   You think I'm gonna let you get   some, put on your clothes, then run   outta here and never see you again   in who knows when?   You a blue-moon fool.   What else?   Trust you?  Because of trusting you   we have a son.  Remember your son?   Mookie, I told you already it's too   fucking hot to make love.   I'm sorry, but no rawness is   jumping off tonight.   Of course I'm sweating.  I'm   burning up.  It's hot, moron, only   a hundred degrees in here.   It's cold.   Later for you.   What?   Feels good.   MURDER   THE LAST TIME   Burn it down.  Burn it down.   It's your turn.   Me Black.  Me Black.   Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him   alone.   Him no white.  Him no white.   Mookie!  Mookie!   This is our neighborhood.   Where are you going?   Mookie, you must think I'm stupid   or something.  You're gonna run   outta here and I won't see your   black ass for another week.   You don't care about me and you   definately don't care 'bout your son.   Be a man.   Act like one then.  Be a man.   You're to the curb.  You better   step off.  Get a life.   Good morning.   Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself   killed last night.   I didn't.   We're still standing.
