Oh, Adam, don't tease her. You never got an A in science in your life! 3:30 I guess. Just a hunch. We've been given a gift here, honey. A real live little girl. She likes us a lot. She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to things . The house, antiques, your model. Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone. You can build another one... with her. Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls. She's just... missed out on some love, that's all... You know, I've been thinking. I could teach Lydia to sew. Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here. You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers. If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful... Adam ! Why did you build a whorehouse? Have you ever been to...? He might have hurt somebody. Who did the sushi? The sushi? I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi? I don't care, I've changed my mind. ... I feel really confident. We're getting better at this stuff. We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight! I've got an idea. You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it. I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there. No, we don't. We can work something out ourselves. We just have to try harder. Honey. Let's go. She's only fourteen... Maybe we should knock first? Oh, Adam. I don't have gloves. My nails keep getting longer. I'll break them. Bet... el... geuse. What an awful name. I thought it was like -- you know. The juice of beetles . What happened? Betelgeuse ! ... Yes this must be him. Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse... Here's something. Then it should be here. Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam? Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot! Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her. You know you're really a pretty girl. Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors. I feel really stupid. God, this is so corny. Have we been reduced to this? Sheets? That guy is in our cemetery. Oh, Adam. We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were -- Look at this, everything is different down here. All our furniture is gone. No. But it's somewhere without big worms. Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife. Draw door? I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book. I don't know... what are you looking up? We don't know who he is... ... I'm going to talk to that little girl. We're not going to wait here like cornered animals. I can tell you that. We need help. I'm going to talk to that little girl. But she saw us. I could feel it. That little girl saw us. That's it? No number, or instructions? Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something. Death didn't improve your sense of humor. We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people. I know. I'm sorry. Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone. Whatever it is it can't be worse than this. No, I'm not putting up with this. We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey. Is this a punishment for something we did in life? What can we do? Adam, we are in hell. I hate these people. I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever! At least we won't have to worry about her. Just says 'won't.' Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.' She can't see you, right? In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead. What's she doing here? Dishes? We haven't eaten in three weeks! Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around people , get out to the church and go grocery shopping. In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper. I can't clean anything. The vacuum is out in the garage. I can't leave the house. Why don't they tell us something? Where are all the other dead people in the world? Why is it just you and me? There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch? Is this a punishment? Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to last ? I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics. I don't think we survived the crash. De ceased . I don't know where it came from. Yes it did. Yes it did. I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one. That's how long you were gone. Two hours. Oh, Adam. We're home. In our own house. Nonsense. I'll make some coffee. You get some more firewood. I am sitting. I'm not sure. It feels... frozen. This fire wasn't burning when we left the house. Oh... I'm sorry... You're doing it, Adam. You're saving this town. Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty. Adam! Wave at the lion. I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone. Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family. Oh no. Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home. Helen got it for me in Oslo. Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it. You've finished the streets? I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing? I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have killed him. Home. Home . Home ! Just one daughter. Just get some people out of our house. We're... What about Betelgeuse? About what? Our cemetery? What do you mean? What's he do? If... we have trouble. What about the guy in the flyer? Betelge... No. Yes. We're very unhappy. We need help. We deserve help. Are you Juno, our case worker? How'd you do on the science test? So, never let Beetle Juice out. Never. Besides... We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too. No you don't! No... Lydia... Why? No, Lydia, we're dead. No, wait! Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here. We can't. We haven't left the house since the funeral. Tell the truth. We're practicing. If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits. 'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks. And live in what, our station wagon? Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling. No! Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning! That's right, Jane. Complete vacation.Not these people! They are ruthless! I think she's in with them. Just don't tell Lydia. Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration. Otho'll know what to do. I feel like we've been at war, Charles. Lydia, at your age, you are so young . Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door. Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission? I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese. Is there no Szechuan up here? Hunan? It's Otho ! Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors. You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry. It doesn't matter. What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud. I am going to teach you something here Lydia. You've got to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all over you. Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never lived ! All right, you dead people! Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with! Of course we weren't scared. Just a little startled. One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali. Tried to convince me that this house is haunted. Kids. Kids. Kids! I love them. Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon. Don't you dare . Don't you dare talk to others about me. I'm an artist ! The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends. Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone. I can't believe you are doing this to me! Ghosts . I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight. Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic. My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for Architectural Digest . In fact, no one here tonight has not been in Vanity Fair . Except you. Joke! Joke! Aspirin! It doesn't matter what brand. You jerks ! That is my art, and it is dangerous ! You think I want to die like that? Lydia. Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs. We'll be the art center of summer New York. I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture. And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it. This is our first meal in this house, Lydia. Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one? What's happening to them? Are they still here, Otho? Look at the tiny figures. It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in sheets ! She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin... No ! Do not encourage this little... person. Probably the world's largest Reader's Digest collection! C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience. Entirely bare. Maybe Charles does. Attic space. That's Charles' study. But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it. He's such a sheep. Otho, I can not live with these cheap domestic floor tiles. Oh my God ! Of course, her favorite color! How beautiful ! Viridian? What is...? What do you think? I know ... I read your book, The Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf . Okay? What's wrong? The rest of the house is probably worse. When can you and I get started? I'm so glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.Get away you little monster. Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks? You don't have to answer now. He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway. You take your vacation, Adam. Say 'bye! Adam my booyy! When you're really rich in what matters... ... nothing matters! My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village. And he's got a little stress problem... ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet! You'll be rich! Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien! I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England. Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things. Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now. This house is too big. It really ought to be for a couple with a family. You could double the size of your hardware store! You'll be rich. Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real! From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph! Honey -- today I am three hundred fifty thousand dollars! Hi, Barb! I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation! Well, I just placed a call to your mother. She had stepped out but I have some news for her. Hellooo! How's school? Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code. I'm sure you're going to be very happy there. Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School? That's a skeleton key. It'll open any door in that house. Will you give it to your father? And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house. In case he needs advice in that area. Come see me. Well there's a Little Deetz at least. Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?Oh puh-leeze! So can I? I got an A! I got it. And I took pictures of the new church for you, too. Really. I don't know. Wait a minute. I had some licorice ice cream earlier. You guys could be gas. What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas? God, if this is true this is like, amazing! I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes? You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you? My father bought this place. He never walks away from equity. Why don't you leave? And this used to be your house, I bet. Why do you want to scare everybody? You did this? You carved all these little figures and houses and things? Stepmother. I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles. Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom? I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through Handbook for the Recently Deceased . It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... I am strange and unusual. Is this like a trick question? Night of the Living Dead ? It's this gross movie. I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are sheets . Are you gross under there? Are you Night of the Living Dead under there? Like all bloody veins and pus? A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic? It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way. I said it was against my religion. I got a C. Step... mother. Life is just... too awful. I want to be dead too. He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you. I hate you! I can't trust anybody! I don't wear that stuff to bed . Besides, there's nothing wrong with it. I'm getting out of here. Funeral. God, you guys really are dead ! What was it like? The funeral. Did you cry? I always tell the truth. Of course I can see you. You're not gross. Why were you wearing a sheet? Your qu...? But you're... W... What is it? ... I will. You've got to help them. They'd look silly on me. I'm fourteen years old! No I don't. I don't take orders from smurfs. You were the snake! Right? I know. I saw you. God, you're anatomically correct! Your name is Beetle Juice ? Yecch! That's as bad as Deee lia Deee tz. I am not ! Beetle... Juice? Breakfast beetle? Beetle? Beetle fruit? Fruit bat? Fruit battle? Volkswagen? Fruit wagon? Beetle! I don't know what that signal means. Your fingers are so small I can't see them. First word -- two syllables. Three syllables. Yes. I... I don't know what your name is. Yeah. Well, it can't be any worse than my life here. I think so. I want to get in. Are you a spirit too? Where'd they go? Of course they're dead. They're ghosts. Mr. and Mrs. Maitland? I've come for the last time. Where are you? Barb... They're... not here anymore. I can't bring the ghosts. They're not here! I cannot believe this. Come on. Leave their stuff alone. Listen, you guys. These ghosts are really nice people. I think we scared them off. Let's just leave them alone. Okay? They're ghosts. They do what they want. This is not a joke ! That sheet was full of ghosts. Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest -- Stepmother's... Dad. Do you believe me? Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw. I'm lonely. Stepmother. I was just trying to open the door. Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key. Stepmother. She's out torturing the movers. Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn. My whole life is a darkroom! One ... big... dark... room. Delia hates it. I'm sorry already. Shhhh. They didn't commit suicide. I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared -- It wasn't a joke. I saw some ghosts. I told them you were too mean to be afraid. Any particular kind? I say let's keep it the way it is. I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food. It's okay. How's the dirt business? Yes, but I'm going to live at home. Is this the key to the attic? What happened to the people who used to live here? Adam ! Adam ! Their wedding clothes. Wait a minute! What am I worried about? Otho, you can't even change a tire! That's slavery and murder. You don't know these people. They're just like you and me. They're nice people! The attic. They don't want to come down. Otho, that's terrible. Hold your breath and we'll pull.
