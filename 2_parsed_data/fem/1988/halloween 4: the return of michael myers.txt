Well tonight is very important for your father and me. You'll have to watch Jamie tonight. Hang on Mrs. Pierce. Not that tie, on the other side. That's not the only thing your eating Rachel. We should call the fire department. Because the lights are all out. Honey, I don't think their home. Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink Rachel? Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope she feels better. Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.

It's been eleven months. Sure it does. Like a real sister? Like a sister? Do you love me Rachel? I can't sleep. You don't believe that do you? Then we'll be safe? Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.All right. That's all the windows, Dad. Why? Dad, what's going on? Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman. He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me. I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay? Hi Rachel.Okay, bye. Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen? Fact it Rach, you are desperate. Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit. You won't come on too strong. You won't look pushy. I know! Don't you want to talk to him? You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes. Hi Jamie.Brady! Come with us! Brady! Brady! Brady! Brady! Come with us. Brady! Brady! What does that mean? I don't know! She's not dead! Not without Jamie. 10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle. Michael Myers. We've been better. Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties. So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys. Just leave me alone and lets forget it. You don't owe me anything. I don't know Brady. My parents are going to come home early tonight. Don't get angry. This morning. So I have to watch Jamie tonight. My parents baby-sitter canceled. Its about tonight. We need to talk. Jamie needs a Halloween costume. I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard. You guys always look great. What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself. Can't you find somebody else? Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is. Mom, please Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter? I've got you come on, go down. Well try dammit! I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie? No. Jamie! Real soon, Jamie. Now shh. Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock. Had enough? Jamie, wait for me. I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go. Coming. Yeah, hurry up. What? Jamie, what happened? In a second. You bet. But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating. You ready for some Ice Cream? Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast. How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream? It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy? Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating. Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal. Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment. But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight. Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed. Come on Sunday. Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age. I bet you didn't know that. I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long. We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less. Jamie, sometimes it's... Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you. What is this? Four nights in a row? You going for a record here? The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame? Kido. It's four in the morning. Don't you mean what you do best? You knew. You just didn't care. Hi. Call me. Jamie? I don't know. Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything. Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that. I don't want to look pushy. No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today. You remember Lindsay don't you? Don't touch him Jamie! Sheriff Meeker, we killed him. Uh huh. Okay. Sheriff, what is going on out there? What's going on?
