I hear the notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a big do for the Harvey Dent campaign. No. Yes, but please -- be gentle. Some. I All over the world. They say he spends most of the year overseas -- until recently, anyway. Just what I've heard. Rich. Reclusive. Old money and lots of it. Women find him magnetic. That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks. That's intriguing. They haven't been Don't mind my friend. He's a little nervous tonight. As far as I know. Oh. Sorry. I was thinking. Yum, yum. I get it. Bruce Vain. Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne. You mean Mister One-Nighter? The current record is almost two weeks. That cover girl -- what's her name?

You're awfully sweet to be concerned, but it's That was one of the most gracious fuck-yous it's ever been my pleasure to watch. -- What a nice girl. Do you sail? You do a very convincing imitation. Mm, this is tasty. What's yours? ... Ginger ale? ... I guess I needed a change. Have you ever been to Corto Maltese? We went there once when I was little. I played on the beach. And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced with my father on the hotel patio. That was Corto Maltese. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time...

Are you like this with the other women you know? -- Because I just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation. -- but it's not God. You ... We could try that. I didn't mean to scare you. I just had to come in here and see it that was really you Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is. -- Now you'll have to kill me. Poor thing. You should stay off that horse. ... The rent? Paid? ... To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting. Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner. Okay, I'm a sucker.

BRUCE!! ... live from Halliday Plaza, where a gangland-style execution claimed the life of racketeer Philly Ricorso. Ricorso's death is the third in a rash of underworld killings...  Commissioner, you've heard the rumors. Are these murders the work of the mysterious 'Batman'? Please tell him... I'm not trying to make his life difficult. I'd just -- I'd just like to know what's going Oh my God... I've seen this picture. His face. Allie, look at his face. Oh, Bruce... Alexander, you are on drugs. You're pissing me off, Allie. I know exactly why you're doing this. He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They would Alexander... I This is pointless. I'm leaving. ... of course, after Corto Maltese, this must all seem pretty tame. Not to me. I need a job. Now Vicki. Everyone Then "everyone" must know something I don't. Oh. Really. The fashion world was stunned today by the sudden deaths of top models Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg. Cause of death has been attributed to a violent allergic reaction, although authorities have not yet ruled out the possibility of drug use. Dave? Jack? Who was that? I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here? ... Thank you. And you want a -- Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup. I've seen worse.

What about the girl? Can't we -- ... A hundred and eight? Well -- I think you might consider thanking I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of I won't let you have it. I know you can break my neck and take it. But the Joker's on that same roll. I -- Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.

We have to -- ... So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you? I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. You're one man. You can't save everybody. Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself. Oh, God. I've got to have some coffee or BRUCE! Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make up. I'll need you soon." -- I thought you ought to know -- he's coming for you... ... Where are you calling from?
