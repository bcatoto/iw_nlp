You guys are sick. It means she's screwed up. Can you say anything but "cool"? I could go for that. Jesus... What's it doing?! He's still working on the game. I am awake. Don't you see them? Angels.  There are angels inside. One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware. I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you? Is that your question? You have no time.  What is your question? You have no time. The City of Truth. Hi, honey. Of course I am. I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you... I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you? Magic.  We'll be together again. I know you don't believe in an afterlife, but there is one.  Heaven is real. Not yet, honey... ...but I can fix that. Give her a chance, will you?
