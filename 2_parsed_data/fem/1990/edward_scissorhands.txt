Avon calling.  Weren't you just here?  No, not since last season. Today I've come to  show you our exquisite new line of soft colors  in shadows, blushes and lipstick. Everything  you need to accent and highlight your changing  looks.  My changing looks? That's good.  Well, it goes that saying and I also have a  complete selection of your old favorites, those  tried-and-true products we've all come to  depend on year-in and year-out.  Come on, Peg. I never buy anything from you.  You know that?  I know. Bye, Helen.  I could? I don't think so.  You know, on TV they say you repairmen are  lonely bunch of people. Housewives get lonely  too. Although you may not realize it since they  haven't made a commercial on the subject.  On no! Who could that be? Will you excuse me  for a moment? Now. Don't go anywhere. I'll be  right back. This is fascinating. I wouldn't  want to miss a moment of it.  Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling.  Why! Peg. Have you gone blind? Can't you see  there's a vehicle in my driveway?  Oh, yes.  Well, I'm surprised you don't realize that  means I'm busy.   Okay. Now, we should decide on lipsticks. Okay,  dear, what one did you like best? There was the  Winsome Wahini which looked charming on you. Or  the Bahenie Bliss.  I like them both.  Well, great.  You don't actually think I have any money, do  you?  It's just not my day.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, it's so beautiful. Hello? Hello? Avon calling, oh my. Hello, I'm Peg  Boggs. I'm your local Avon representative.  Hello. I'm sorry to barge in like this. But you  don't have any reason to be afraid. This is  some huge house, isn't it? Thank goodness for  those aerobics classes.  Hello. Hello. Why are you hiding back there?  You don't have to hide from me. I'm Peg Boggs.  I'm your local Avon representative and I'm as  harmless as cherry pie.  Oh my! I can see that I've disturbed you. How  stupid of me! I'll just be going now.  Oh my! What happened to you?  Uh, put those down. Don't come any closer. Just  please... Those are your hands? Those are your  hands. What happened to you? Where are your  parents? Hum... Your mother? Your father?  Are you alone? Do you live up here all by  yourself? What happened to your face? Hum, you  know, I won't hurt you. But at the very least  let me give you a good astringent and this will  help to prevent infection. What's your name?  Edward? I think you should just come home with  me.  Oh!  No, Don't be. You go ahead and look you have  every reason to be excited.  Oh! Are you ok?  Hello.  Hi, it's Margie. Listen, I was standing outside  talking to Carol and Peg drove by, she had  somebody in the car.  Did you get a good look?  No, did she say anything to you, about having  guest?  She didn't say anything. She rang my doorbell  early this morning.  No, ok, I'll meet you on the corner. Right,  Bye.  Oh, damn!  Here we go, dear. This is our house. And you  can just go right in and make yourself right at  home. OK? And just, well have something to eat  or drink, whatever you... Here, dear. Here  you... This is the front door here, Here we go,  right in here.  Joyce, I just saw this strange guy drop in with  Peg. I didn't get a very good look at him. He  looked kind of pale. Okay, I'll be right there.  Don't do anything without me. Okay? Bye.  Yes, I'll be right there.  Here we are. So, oh, this is the living room  and back here, the bedrooms. You want to see  the pictures? All right. Well, this is my  husband, Bill. He's a bowling champion. Do you  know what bowling is? Bowling? Well, here they  are down at the lake, fishing. I think Kevin  looks a little glum Because they didn't catch  anything that day. And here's my daughter, Kim.  All dressed up the junior prom. She's a senior  now. I can't believe it. She's camping in the  mountains with some friends, but she'll be back  in a few days and you can meet her then. Isn't  she beautiful? That's my family. Now, go on,  dear. I'll show you the rest of the house. Then  you can just freshen up and make yourself at  home. Okay? That's the kitchen over there. You  help yourself to anything you want to eat or  drink. Those are grapes. Back here are the  bedrooms. Let me get you some towels, then I  will see what we can find to wear. You know  what? I think I have some of Bill's old clothes  in here. This is perfect. Here. These should  just fit you.  Oh, no, no. Don't be alarmed. That's just a  phone. Now you can go in Kim's room and put  these on. I'll be right with you.  No, no, scissors. That's right. Well, he was  born up there or something. Have you seen him  before? No, I don't think he's been off the  grounds before today. You're kidding. How did  you get together with him? I have to go. I'll  talk to you later Margie, Bye-bye. I'm sorry Edward, I didn't... oh, dear. May I  help you with this?  There you go. Oh, dear, you've cut your face.  Let me get this right off. Does that hurt?  Okay. No, good. Now let's get you dressed.  Okay. There we go. Very fine. You look fine,  just fine. Come on, we can't wait for you.  You've got rollers in your damn hair.  Okay. Now what did I do with my sci... Edward,  um, would you. Thank you. I have a doctor  friend who I think could help you.  Yes, I can help with the scars. I just want to  consult the Avon handbook before doing  anything.  Kevin, it's not polite to stare. Think how it  would make you feel if somebody were staring at  you.  Well, I would, so don't do it!  I think he prefers Edward.  I was just...  Bill, could I have the salt and pepper? Thank  you.  Would you like some butter for your bread?  Great.  I've had enough.  You think you can sleep? Things feel strange  now, but soon you'll feel right at home. Good  night.  The light concealing cream goes on first, then  you blend and blend and blend. Blending is the  secret. More concealing for you? But you  complexion is so fair. Now this has a touch of  lavender in it. Give it a try here. Close  enough. OK. This should do the trick here. I  have another idea. We'll cover up the scars and  start with a completely smooth surface. Don't  eat this stuff!  Sports announcements on   They filled the whole tape.  Edward, you did us? Oh, Bill. It's us.  Oh, Edward.  It's not heaven he's from. It's straight from  the stinking flames of hell. The power of satan  is in him. I can feel it. God, you have the  poor sheep strayed so far from the path.  Don't come near me.  Edward, don't you listen to her.  Hi!  You are all hiding in there like a bunch of old  hermit crabs.  Hi, Joyce. Hi!  Shame on you, keeping your unusual guest all to  yourself. We think that's mighty selfish of  you.  No, it, it's... things have just been a little  hectic around here. That's all.  Oh, that was so sweet of you to want to correct  the situation. What time does the barbecue  begin?  Barbecue?  Well, you intend to show your guest hospitality  by introducing him to your friends, don't you?  I'll bring coleslaw.  And I will bring the ambrosia salad. What time  was it that you said?  What time? Ah... bill.  About five?  He has been sent first to tempt you. But it's  not too late. You must push him from you. Expel  him. Trample down the perversion of nature.  Did you hear that? He's the perversion of  nature. Wow, isn't that exciting? See you  later. Bye bye.  I've always said that you really can't have a  picnic or a barbecue without deviled eggs.  They're just the best. They make the thing. Oh,  dear. Edward. That's wonderful. I didn't know  you chopped all those things. What a really  big... Oh, all right now. It's just a nick. There's no  need to be nervous, dear. You know, Esmeralda  won't be here and the rest of neighbors there  are really very nice. There's no need to be  nervous. They are so eager to meet you. You  just have to be yourself.  That's right. Just your own sweet self.  He did them just like that.  This afternoon?  Are you ok?  Do you want something to eat?  Are  you hungry? Do you want a cracker?  He's so... different completely different, No  kidding mysterious.  Do you imagine those hands are hot or cold?  Just think what a single snip could do.  Or undo.  Who's handicapped? My goodness! Don't be  ridiculous. You're not handicapped. You're...  What do they call that? Exceptional. My name's  Joyce. And I noticed that you have not tasted  any of the ambrosia salad that I made  especially for you. Allow me.   You must try this.  You must try this.  It's my mother's recipe.  Let him chew, for heaven sakes with your green  thumb. I could use your help.  Me, too. There you go.  I want a row of angels.  Sorry, ladies. But he's promised to come to my  house first.  One more.  Haven't you, Eddie?  I can't wait to take a shower.  And wash off the mildew.  He'd rather complain.  Honey, that was Edward.  Edward's come to live with us. There's nothing  to be upset about. No, no. It's okay.  Now you stay in Kevin's room tonight. Tomorrow  we'll fix your room right.  Oh, honey, I couldn't have left him there all  alone. You would have done the same thing.  Oh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you. He  can't help the way he is. Have a little  sympathy.  Then let's just say hello and later you can  come downstairs and shake his hand.  Well, not literally. Goodness, you scared him  half to death.  Hi, Bill. I just wanted you two to have a  proper introduction. Edward, this is our  daughter Kim.  Kim, this is Edward who's going  to live with us.  Eddie. Thirsty?  Kisses, Hush up. Quiet now. I can hardly hear  myself think. Momma's precious little baby  girl. Wouldn't you like a nice cool glass of  lemonade?  You should see the clown in front of Ms.  Peter's yard.  That's him?  Edward, you forgot your cookies.  Let's go.  Bill, you know what Edward told me? He had  lunch at Jackie's today.  She's just had her kitchen completely redone.  New paint, new cabinets, new floors, new  microwave, new Sonnet dishwasher.  Isn't that something? Jim, didn't you tell me  your mom had her kitchen done too?  My goodness sake! I wonder what it's like to be  that rich.  Now, Bill. Margie made him cookies today.  I can't eat that. He used his hands. I don't  think it's sanitary.  Honey, you want me to help you clean that up?  This can't possibly be my Alexis. She looks so beautiful. Look at you. She's  gorgeous. Thank you.  It won't be long. She has just to decide on the  style, and then it will be fine. She just has  to decide what style she wants.  I was hoping for something big and bouffant.  Kind of like mine. Don't you worry , Kisses.  You'll be so pretty. Eddie, is there anything  you can't do? You take my breath away. I swear.  Look at this. Have you ever cut a woman's hair?  Would you cut mine? That was the single most  thrilling experience of my whole life.  We're getting the head of the company.  Hi, honey. We're in here.  Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?  Hello. Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you  in person. This is such an honor. Yes. He's  right here. Great. So then you know all about  it. Aha. That's exactly what I've been using.  Well, I've had a little trouble getting it to  the right consistency. Yeah, right. just a  little. I'll try that. Well, what imaginative  suggestions! I sure will. Thank you so much.  Bye bye. No wonder she's the head of the company. You  know, she started out as a sales representative  just like me. I've always wanted to talk to her  but until now I never had a reason. Thanks,  Edward.  You bet she did.  I'll get that.  Edward! We're here. Come on. Let's get you  sharpened up.  What's been the best part of your new life here  in town?  Have you ever thought of having corrective  surgery or prosthetics? I know a doctor that  might be able to help you.  But if you had regular hands you'd be like  everyone else.  Then no one would think you're special. You  wouldn't be on TV or anything.  No matter what, Edward will always special.  Your work is so interesting distinctive and  unique. Do you have plans to open your own  beauty salon?  Do you have a girl friend? Ahh.  Aren't you excited? Oh, this is just so  thrilling. Wait till I show it to you. It's  just perfect. It's just what we've been looking  for. I want to call it "Shear Heaven." Here we  are. No, all along here I'm going to put a row  of new mirrors. Back up here a whole row of new  cosmetics.  Sure. This is where I stand when I greet the  customers. Back in here is what I really want  to show you. This is the storeroom for  supplies. What I need from you today is to help  me make a decision. Don't, that's dangerous.  You just sit down right there. I have some  smocks. Would you like me to model them? This  is my favorite because it's yellow. And what  it's for is to catch itchy little trimming that  fall down your neck. Then there's this old  purple one, you know, you kind of drape around  you like this.  You're trembling. So am I. I've been waiting  for this moment for so long. Edward! Edward,  you come back here! You can't do that!  I've never seen that.  Hi, Edward. Sorry. We had to go ahead without  you. Here you go.  Wouldn't that be great?  You know. We already have a second on the  house, but don't the testimonials make a  difference?  Did you see here, the mayor's wife  can't wait to become a client?  I can't believe it. Really, it's just an  outrage. Don't you worry. This isn't the end of  it. We'll get your money somewhere.  Are you sure he doesn't know this is Jim's  house?  Please. We know him.  But can we see him now?  He has to stay in prison all night?  Oh, Edward. Hello Edward, dear. I blame myself.  Why don't I set a better example? You saw how I  envied Jim's parents, their money.  Oh, I blithely say, "We'll get money for the  salon somehow." But I never meant stealing.  Stealing's not the way to get it. Stealing's  not the way to get anything.  Why ever did you do this?  I heard this noise and ran out in my bathrobe.  All along I felt in my gut. There was something  wrong with him.  It could have been my house.  It could have been any of our houses.  I warned you, didn't I? I saw the sign of satan  on him.  You didn't heed my warning. but now  you will because now you see it too.  Edward. You stay here.  He didn't want to talk.  He can't talk right now.  We have to get in the house. We don't want to  talk to you. We'll talk to you later.  Well, for goodness sakes, Lois, I'll see you at  our Christmas party. Before I get you here for  your haircut. Of course, we'll have it this  year. Why wouldn't we have it this year? Well,  you may think that, but you're wrong.  Kim!  Simmer down.  You are not seeing Jim tonight?  Honey, this is fascinating. but I don't think  your father's finished yet.  Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you  should do, bit it's not.  Oh, goodness sake, no wonder poor Edward can't  learn right from wrong living in his family.  Did you hear what he did to Peg's curtains?  It is unbelievable that they're having their  Christmas party anyway. Are you going?  Oh, I don't think so.  He practically raped Joyce, you know  threatening her with those knives? It's a  miracle she escaped.  I don't have anything against Bill and Peg,  but...  I know, I know. They've got that teenage  daughter in the house. Oh, those poor things  after what happened to me can you imagine?  What do you say to Peg about the Christmas  party?  I said I hoped. We'd make it.  I lied, too.  Edward, do you want to give me that new  haircut?  yes, sure.  It makes me proud to have you as my own  personal hairdresser.  Other people's feelings?  A few manners? Just never you mind. Just you  cut away. Cut away. It needs something else.  What do you think, honey?  More bells. Okay.  Of course I think we should be having this  party. Of course I do. I mean as just what we  need is just to calm things down and then  everything will just go back to normal. Do you  have any more bells, honey?  You...your father will find him this minute.  Edward! I'm calling the police!  All that blood, sweetie, and it's just a little  cut.  Oh... Uh...  Oh, dear.  Helen, did you actually see him?  Yes, look.  You see, I told you he was a demon.  Oh, don't start that stuff again.  He went that way. You have to do something  about that.  He's a de... a demon.  You've got to do something! All right, Let's  see. If he's at our house come on, oh...  I'm sure your father will find him soon.  It's almost eight thirty. Great party, huh?  So do I, honey. You know, when I brought Edward  down here to live with us, I really didn't  think things through. And I didn't think about  what could happen to him, or to us, or to the  neighborhood. You know, I think that maybe it  might be best if he goes back up there. Because  at least there he's safe, and we'd just go back  to normal.  Oh, dear. Oh, just... Well, let's get in the  car and go look for him.  He's Max'es.  We'll be right back, dear.  Kevin! Kevin! Edward! Get away. What happened?  Edward! Go home! Go home!  Kevin's all right! It was just the tiniest  scratch! He's gone! Let's not bother him, all  right? Let just leave him alone!  I don't believe it. They don't have him. I'm  going! No! That's not a good idea!
