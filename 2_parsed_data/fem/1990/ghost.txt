What a mess! Use your mask, dummy. Sam, look, there's a whole eight  feet up there. We have all this height, Sam. We  could add a second floor and put our  bedroom upstairs. That would leave  all this space. For space. Just space. Hey, Sam, turn around. All together now. One, two, three. You're the good omen. It's gorgeous. Sell it? Carl, we just bought it. Morning, Mr. Wheat. They're already here. I know. And Andy Dillon called. He  said they need $900,000 transferred  to Albany by noon. A man and a woman are lying in bed  when the woman's husband suddenly  comes home. Frightened, she tells  the man he has to leave instantly  through the window. He has no time  to dress. It's raining outside. The man, running  naked along the street, sees some  joggers approaching. One of the joggers calls out. "Hey,  do you always go jogging naked?" And  the man says, "Yes, always." And then the other jogger says, "And  do you always wear a condom?" The  man looks down, embarrassed, and  replies, "Only when it's raining." Now just relax and have fun, okay?  It's not the end of the world if you  lose this account. You've always got  me. See ya. Where you guys from, the New York  City Ballet? You bastard. Don't do that to me.  You scared me half to death. Carl? Did you invite him? In the bedroom. You like it, huh? Sam, you kept that chair? But it doesn't go with anything. It's okay, I'll paint it. They took away my MasterCard. It was  Christmas, for godssake. It wasn't four thousand. And I'd  already sent in the payment! You're  the ones that lost it. No I'm not. Can you believe it? And the next  thing I know, he's telling me his  life story. I couldn't believe it.  Everything. About his divorce, how  he'd just arrived in New York, how  he didn't know any women. And all  with this Montana accent. The one you always slip into it when  you get nervous. "Yes, Ma'am. Thank  you, Ma'am. Can I fondle your breasts,  Ma'am?" Admit it. You liked me. You were  interested. Cute? Do you believe this? I should have  been Picasso's mistress. I should  have been living in Barcelona or  Paris. But no, I'm moving in with a  New York banker who thinks I'm cute. I felt inspired. What? Are you jealous? Sam, let me  tell you something. He's not even  looking at me. It's you he idolizes.  He doesn't see me at all... Anyway,  he's not my type. What are you doing? What's the matter? I can tell. You're worried, aren't you? About  moving in together? Then what? The promotion? You know what? I love you. I really love you. Don't watch that stuff. Threes? Sam, get serious. Besides,  you lead a charmed life. I could tell. Did I tell you what Marcia said? Six? No I didn't. Sam, don't be so  blasï¿½. I'll have two major pieces in  the show. The New York Times reviews  her gallery all the time. This could  be huge. Eight million readers, that's who. I want to marry you, Sam. I've been thinking about it for days.  More than thinking. I want to do it.  I want to jump in whole hog... What is that look for? Do you love me, Sam? How come you never say it? You say "ditto". It's not the same. Sometimes you need to hear it. What should we do? Give it to him! Sam, No! Sam!!!!! Sam? What's the matter? Is something  wrong? What is it, honey? What is it, honey? Don't leave me. I need you, Sam. Oh God, Sam... I picked up your shirts this morning.  I don't know why. Mr. Reynolds said  to tell you hello. I broke into tears.  It's so hard... I think about you every minute. It's  like you're still here, like I can  feel you, Sam. Frank, what's wrong? Frank? Sam? Sam's address book. No! I miss him, Carl. Wait. Wait. Not that one. No. I can't do it Carl. Okay. Just a short walk. Frank, what's wrong? Sorry 'bout that. Rosa Santiago. Please be seated. My sister will be with us soon. Sister Oda Mae. Grant us the gift of  your all-seeing presence. Appear for  us now. Mrs. Santiago. Buenos dias. I understand you are hoping to contact  your husband. Si. Si. Well, I believe he's gonna be with  us today. Oh, tsank you, tsank you. But there's no telling about the  other world. You gotta cast out all  doubt. You gotta believe. Do you  believe? Si. Si. I believe. I believe. And remember, we don't make no  promises. I can phone up there till  I'm blue in the face, ...but it don't necessarily mean  he's gonna be home. Them folks go  shopping, they play bingo. It's just  like here. You can't always get 'em. Okay, let's get ready then. We got a problem here. I don't think  he's in. Wait. I feel something. Did  he know someone who's passed over,  someone named Anna... Mary...  Consuela... Maria? Si, si! His mama. She's Maria. Ah! I knew it. He's with his mama. I'm afraid this is gonna be too hard.  Now I got two souls I gotta contact.  I don't know about that. It's  difficult, you know. The pain. The  effort. I pay more. How much? How much? Twenty dollars. Welcome, Rosa Santiago. You are  fortunate today. The channel is clear.  Many spirits are gathering. My husband? I can feel his vibration. Yes, yes,  he is drawing toward us now. I can  see him coming. Julio! Julio! How is he? How does he  look? Oh, he is a very handsome man. Handsome? In our Father's Kingdom we are all  handsome. Julio! He is standing before me. He is  wearing a black suit. A black suit? Oh yes, yes. He was  buried in that. Who's there? Where are you? Julio! Julio! Get out of here! Leave me alone! Keep him away! Do something. Help me. Stop it! Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something. Sam Wheat! Samweet? Lord, I swear, no more cheatin'. I  promise, Lord. I don't want to go to  hell. I'll do anything. Gimme a  penance. Just make him go away. My mama, her mama, may they rest in  peace, they had de gift. Mama always  said I had it, but I never did. She  tol' me all about it, how it felt  an' all. But now that it's happenin'  I don't know what to do. You're  scarin' me half to death. Please,  you gotta go away, you gotta find  someone else. I'm gettin' there fast. Leave me alone. Where are you? Where? I'm right here. "I'm standing right beside you." Are you white? Oh God, I knew it. He's white. Why  me? Why would she listen to me? Forget it, mister. I can't. Hello. Molly? Is this Molly speaking? Yes. My name is Oda Mae. I'm a spiritual  reader and adviser. I'm calling for a friend of yours.  He asked me to call. This is  important. You gotta believe me.  Don't be afraid. Who is this? I got a message from Sam. What? Sam Wheat. He asked me to call. What'd I tell you. Look, I don't care what you do to  me, I'm not goin' nowhere. Okay! Okay! I'll go. You just shut  your mouth. I can't believe I'm doin' this. I  gotta be a crazy lady goin' into the  city with you. I never go there.  What the hell you doin' in my life,  huh? Why me? There's nobody there. No, sir. I did what I promised. I  said I'd come and I'm here. I didn't  say anything 'bout waitin'. Hello, who's there? Don't go away. It's Oda Mae Brown. I  called you last night. Your friend  Sam says you gotta talk to me. Hey you, Molly! You gotta listen to  me! this is for real. Sam is here.  He needs to talk to you. He says remember the starfish at  Montego Bay? Remember the picture he  took a' you in Reno? Remember his green underwear, the  pair you wrote your name on? She  wrote her name on 'em? Hey, do you mind? This here's a  private conversation. What about the sweater you knitted  that was too big? Four sizes. You couldn't throw it out. He saw.  He was there. This is for real. Hey  do you hear me up there? I'm not talkin' to you. Kiss my behind! Listen, I'm not gonna stand here all  day. Forget it. I've had enough of this. Molly? I'm Oda Mae Brown. You can call me Oda. Why should I believe you? Why should  I believe any of this? Girl, if you think I'd come down  here for the fun of it, you got  another think comin'. This Sam of  yours... I don't know, lady. I mean,  you ever hear a whole night of "Henry  the Eighth I am?" He did that? That's how he got me to  go out with him. And he cain't carry a tune. I know. Oh God. This is all so crazy.  I can't believe I'm talking to you  like this. I don't believe in these  things. I don't believe in life after  death. He says you're wrong. You're talking to him right now? What? You think I'm makin' it up? Where is he? How should I know? It's not like I  can see him. I just hear his voice. He says he's holding your hand. I'm sorry. I don't believe you. Why  are you doing this to me? I don't  believe a word you're saying. Sam is  dead. He's dead. He says he's holding your hand. He says he loves you... so much. No. He would never say that. Ditto? What's that mean, ditto? Sam? To tell the truth, I don't know how  I'm doin' it. In fack, confidentially,  nothin' like this never happened to  me before. Now, all a sudden, I can't  turn it off. Is this you? Is this him? Hazel eyes, huh? You sound like they'd  be blue. I don't understand. Why did he come  back? Why is he still here? Cause he's stuck, that's why. He's  between worlds. It happens sometimes,  when their spirits get out too quick.  He thinks he still has stuff t'do  down here. Oh, oh, now he's got an attitude. We're having a discussion. Whataya mean, you're not angry? If  you weren't angry you wouldn't be  raisin' your voice like that. Ah ah, baby. That does it. I don't  talk to anybody who takes the Lord's  name in vain. You relax. You're the dead one. You  want my help, then you apologize.  Nobody talks to me like that,  understand? Excuse me, girl. Time for me to go. I don't believe I'm watching this. Monsieur has a message for you. You can't tell her like that. And  would you stop movin' all over the  place? You're makin' me sick. He's sayin' you're in danger. Danger?... What do you mean? He says he knows the man who killed  him, Willie Lopez. He's Puerto Rican. Write it down. Now I'm a secretary. 321? Hey, that's my neighborhood. He's got his wallet and key. He was  in here. In here? He says he was set up, that he was  murdered. He wants you to go to the  police. I'm sorry. I don't want nothin' to  do with this. Don't follow me! I've done all I'm  gonna do. I'm finished. And I ain't comin'  back. So don't you come botherin' me  again cause it's over. I mean it.  This is it. Have a nice life. Have a  nice death. I'm goin'. It was real, Carl. She was real. She was in touch with him. Carl, she knew things. I told you, the picture in Reno, the  starfish,... damn it, Carl. She said Sam knew who killed him.  That he was set up... murdered. She had a name, an address -- Willie  Lopez, 321 Prospect Place. She said  he had Sam's wallet. That's what I have to find out. Sam wants me to go to the police. You don't believe me. You don't  believe any of this, do you? You white fascist bigot. Who do you  think you are? Bed Stuy's part of  New York, you know. This is America. Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin'? Look, you've gotta believe me. I  don't even believe this stuff, myself.  But this is real. Do you think I'd  come here if it wasn't real? You  told me to come if I had any new  information. Well, here I am. Don't look at me like that. You guys  use psychics all the time. Damn it. I know how this sounds. I  hear myself saying it and I want to  cringe. But this woman knew things  she couldn't have known, intimate  details. Things Sam only said to me. I'm telling you. The killer's name  is Willie Lopez. I've got his address.  You've got to check it out. What are you doing? Where's your  file on Willie Lopez? This isn't possible. There were words,  private things. How could she have  known all that? Ways? What ways? No! She was real. She said things.  She knew about a sweater I knitted,  about songs we sang... She knew about  this place we went, Montego Bay... Oh God, I wanted it to be Sam. Who's there? Don't worry. It's okay. Oh, that's so sweet. Sure. Are you alright? You look nervous,  upset. I didn't have time. I went to the police, Carl. You were right, you know. I felt  like such a fool. They brought out a  file on this psychic woman ten inches  thick. It was awful. The sad part is that I believed her.  I believed her, Carl. It was all a sham. Why?... I was a fool. I don't believe  anything anymore. Why would people  do such things? I feel so alone. Oh God, I don't know what's real  anymore. I don't know what to think. I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. It's  too soon... You've been great Carl,  but... I need you to leave. Please.  I need you to. Sam? What'd you do, tell every spook in  town about me? I got spooks from out  of town here. There's stuff goin' on  you wouldn't believe. I can't hardly  believe it myself. I don't. Forget it. I'm not doin' anything.  You're holdin' on to a life that  don't want you no more. Give it up. Dead, yeah, but you ain't finished  dyin'. Give up the ghost. You're asking me? Does it look like I'm speakin' to  you? So, are you gonna leave or not? I've  got work to do. What's a matter? You're supposed to  be concentrating. How do you expect  me to do this if you're not  concentrating? Okay then. You ready?  Let's do it. Oh, Lord! Stop! Whatcha doin' to me? Get out of here, you little shit! Lord oh Lord, don't you ever do that  to me! Never again. Never. No more, uh uh, no more. I want everybody out. Now! Out! I said out! That means you,  too! Oda Mae, there's a man here who says  he has to see you right away. I ain't seein' nobody. I beg your pardon! I'm not seeing  customers right now. I'm the one. But not now. It's been known to happen. But it's  not gonna happen now, so come back  later. What's your friend's name? This ain't no guessin' game. Lookit, I don't know what your trouble  is... Who are you? Willie!? Because I'm psychic. He tried to kill me! Why? Why? Talk to me! We're in trouble? Who's we? You're  already dead. Help you? It's me they're tryin' to  kill. Why don't you go find a haunted house  and rattle some chains. Fake ID's? What for? Help you? Whataya talking about  exactly? What else do I have to do? This is crazy. This ain't gonna work.  I don't know nothin' 'bout bankin'. I'm not givin' 'em any money. I'm here to fill out a signature  card for a new account. Yes. 926-31043. Who? Rita Miller. Carl Bruner opened it for me. He  asked me to come in today. Can I have another one please? I  signed the wrong name. I need you to put that in the third  floor file cause I got a transfusion  to make. You know what I mean. Umm, can I keep the pen? Thanks. Lyle Furgeson, please. No. I'm here for the fun of it. Tell him Rita Miller's here. Yes, Sir. Why are you whispering? What? He doesn't remember me? We  were together at the Brewster's  Christmas party. With his wife  Shirley. They had that lovely tree...  all those presents. Why, I'll never  forget all those beautiful... Oops. Gas. A long time. How are Bobby and Snooky doin'? Couldn't be better. So tell me, Fergie, how did you do  on the Gibraltar securities? We sure did. Good old Randy. Got a real head on  his shoulders. "Her" shoulders. I'm closing an account. 926-3143. Make that 31-0-43... Numbers. I'm  dyslexic. Four million dollars?! Yes! Four million. That's right.  That's right. Tens and twenties? A cashier's check. Of course. You know, if you put that Brillo pad  in the freezer, it'll last twice as  long. Yes, Mr. Bruner. Sure. I sure do. Then my mother took all the money  from the oil wells and put it in  gasoline pumps. Every gas station  has 'em you know, sometimes six or  more. It adds up. Well, I've got to leave. It's been a  pleasure doin' business with you.  Say "hi" to Shirley and Snooky for  me. What a day! Lionel? Lionel, a woman who just left, a  black lady, about my height, did you  see her? What did she want? Did it have  anything to do with me? Did she ask  about Sam? Was her name Oda Mae Brown? No. I guess not. Thanks. $4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty. Take it out? Why? Endorse it? Why? No! What are you going to do with it? Away? What do you mean? To who? Are you outta your mind? No! I can't. Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam. Bless you, child. Don't you talk to me. I don't want  you comin' round no more. I mean it.  Understand? Friends? Friends? Carl? Where were you? I thought we  were having...? Forgot? I was worried. Is everything  okay? Are you all right? Why? What happened? Carl, stop this. It was all a hoax.  I told you. It wasn't real. She's a  charlatan. Does this have anything to do with  her being at the bank today? I was sure I saw her. Furgeson says  she was taking out money. It turns  out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.  It's Rita Miller or something. What's wrong? Sure. Just a second. What's going  on? Oh my God. Is that the gas? Me, too. Trouble? What kind of trouble? Is it  that woman, the psychic? Carl, what's going on? Let me help  you. Sam! Not again! What're you doin' here? The check? What do you mean, "the  check". You said they'd never find  out. What's happenin' Oda Mae? They're comin' to kill me. What have you done? Jesus have mercy. Emergency! Let us in! Who you kiddin'? What're you doin'? You can't come in  here. The cat don't like visitors.  She'll pee all over the couch. You  wanna pay for... They're gonna find us. Oh yeah? And how you gonna do that? Sam? What happened? Dead! Oh, thank God. It's over. Who's Carl? Can't you hurry up? Problems? Carl, is that you? Molly, it's Oda Mae. I know what you  think of me, but your life is in  danger. You have to listen to me.  Sam's here, too. You gotta let us  in. Get the hell out of here. I'm calling  the police. Go ahead. We want you to call 'em.  You're in trouble. Let us in. No! Sam's death was no accident. He was  murdered, Molly. Carl was laundering  money at the bank. Sam found out.  He's dangerous. He tried to kill me.  He'll kill you, too. Why are you doing this to me? Get  away from me! I know all about you.  You're a fake. You're just a fake.  Leave me alone! Sam says you're wearin' the blouse  he spilled the Margarita on and the  earrings he gave you at Christmas. See, I'm no fake. Go away! What? Sam says it's for luck. Right. Yes, it's right on the corner.  We're a red brick building with the  entrance on the left side. Please  hurry. Thank you Sergeant. We'll be  waiting right here. Police are on their way. What do we do now? Just wait. Is Sam here? Right here. Can you feel me, Sam? With all his heart, he says. He wishes he could touch you, just  one more time. Oh, Sam. Okay, damn it, you can use me if you  want. Come on. Before I change my mind. Sam! I love you so much. The police! Wait! It's Carl! Come with me. Back to the fire escape. Head for  the roof. This way! Help us, Sam! God almighty, Carl! What are you  doing? What have you done!? In my purse. Over there. I gave it away. Sam? Is that you? I hear you, Sam. Oh God! They're waiting for you, Sam. Ditto. See ya.
