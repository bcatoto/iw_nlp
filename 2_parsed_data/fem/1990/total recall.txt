Doug, don't! Nooo! I would never do anything to hurt you. I want you to come back to me. I love you. I'm here at Rekall. Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you? After all we've been through? It's time you found out. You sure you don't wanna...? For old time's sake. If you don't trust me, you can tie me up. But Doug...There's something I want you to know. You're the best assignment I ever hand. Really. Beats me. I just work here. The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up. Implanted. It was implanted by the Agency. I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago! Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh! I'm not your wife. Doug... Doug, nobody tried to kill you. Oh God, Doug. What did they do to you? Tell me! You went to those brain butchers?! Mars? You've never even been to Mars. Take it easy. Tell me exactly what happened? Why would "spies" want to kill you? Muggers?! Doug, are you all right? What happened? What are you doing? You are somebody. You're the man I love. Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here. Okay? Well...What do you say? There's lots nicer places than Mars. Doug, maybe we should take a trip. And you believe him? Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times. You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring! --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute. Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning. Do what? Yeah, sweetheart? ...You mean it? Let me go! It's not funny, Doug. You dream about her every night. Tell me! Nobody?! What's her name? Who is she? The brunette. The one you told me about. Poor baby. This is getting to be an obsession. Is that better?How could you do this? You're a mutant. But maybe you can change all that. Shut up and drive! The Last Resort! Quick! Then kiss me quick...before you wake up. What's wrong? Enough for everybody to breathe? Of course not. If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control. You sure about this? Aliens?! Where's this "reactor" come from? People are dying, Quaid!! Stop!! We've got to get air!! What reactor?! Where are you going?! I'm not sure dear? What do you think? You two-faced-bastard. Oh, since when? All sorts of things. You might even remember you loved me. Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser. The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks. I'm not a hooker! That's my cover. I used to model for 'em, why? Jump! Kuato wants to see you. Come on! If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay. I said get out! Get out! I'm not falling for it. I think you better leave. You never loved me, Hauser! You just used me to get inside. Because you're still working for Cohaagen. No. Let's forget everything! I've had it with you and your goddamn lies. Oh, she isn't really your wife. How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife. Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!? This is too weird. Hauser, you're lost your mind. Hauser? You're Hauser. What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here? What are you talking about? ...What? You couldn't get me a message? You never wondered what happened to me? I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death! I think it's still hungry. Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing? I love you.
