Art Mo-o-o-ney! That was close... We invested in these factories. In Vancouver. Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex. Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved... Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache... Did she tell you anything? Zuzu Petals! Did she have it? I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford. You suck. Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me. I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow. I'll do my best. Nonsense. After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you. So you... So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself. Uh, let's go sit down. My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon. Who? I have no answers. Thanks for the stain. Find the girl. In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler. We'll chat again, then. Actually, you may take it all now. Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree. Excuse me? But how did you know? Here, take this picture... I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu... I don't have a sense of humor, either. Sorry. Fag? Ass? I'm sorry, is that a joke? Who's your decorator? Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich. The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me. When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you? Please. Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help. I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry. What is it they call you? Mr. Rock and...Wha -- I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry. I'm quitting. I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel. C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel label. Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver. Johnny's C.D.? Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits. This one is putting out low bits. The data is in some fucked binary system. The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc. Comprendo? You're not funny. I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet. What were your words... 'A fucking C.D. This case is closed.' I came to warn you... Hello, Ford... Ah, an obvious choice. Who? You okay? Hello... It's Colleen. With answers. She wants to meet. Down. Way down-town. Late. She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure... Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl. Period. Contacts. Celebrate? Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders? Forget it, man. Make eye contact when you say that. No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in? I mean, she is what this case is about. You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands... Shut up, goodies from the ice queen. Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm. Go on, 'they're stahting.' You're a fucking gentleman. What do you want from me? Spooky. I'll process her. I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity. Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet? So what about this watch? That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky... You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks. I'm, I'm shocked. Quit crying. I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here... You're saying you need money. Let's just declare war on the hellhole. Before they make Crocodile Dundee three. G'day, they say it's worth three grand... 'Bye Ford...' Hey, let me cheer you up. I found the IN X S payment. You wish. Exactly. Assistant. And don't call me Jazz.This isn't music! Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about. Hi, private eye guy! You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right? Do you suspect foul play and stuff? That's cute. You're funny. Do you really know everybody in the industry? You're that guy, the private eye.Yeah, Ford. I'm okay. Hoh graphic! I'm going to dream of ears for a year! Ugh! You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s... Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star. There's that question... Hello, Mr. Tongue! What a perv. Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy. Kill! Kill! Kill! Let go of the belt! What are you doing? You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy. Ick. Smooth. I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny. Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh? Suck a dick, I left my purse... This way... Nice left you got there, jerk. But you know, that was just a dream. Doesn't really count. Ford, you were right! This is boring, guys. I know the feeling. This must be hell. Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo. Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave? Okay? I just blew up. I feel orgasmic. Hah fluck, great video, huh? Who cares about people? Let's watch some 'M.T.V.' What a perv... Why are you depressed? You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover... You didn't ask. Have you ever thought about mousse? Yeah, it's weird. Bobby and Johnny were such good friends... No. Who's Art Mooney? Come again? B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A. Because I know rock-n-roll. Spunk, come back... It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit! Mr. Bus Driver, stop! I dunno. He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so. Ever since he died, I've been chased... Omigod ! I'm so sure! I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and... Why are all these people after me? Peachy. Hello? It's red, Ford. Fluck you! I don't know. I'm so scared. Help me.
