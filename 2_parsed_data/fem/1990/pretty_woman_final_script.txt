Hello, Mr. Lewis.  Edward !  Hi.  I was sorry to hear about Carter.  Well... yeah. I couldn't wait for you !  Yes ?  She was one of my bridesmaids.  Thanks, bye.  He's leaving. Edward's leaving.  Hey, Pops, has Kit been in here ?  Is it all gone ?  I know everybody ! Is it all gone, Kit ?  I can't believe you bought drugs with our rent. What is going on with you, Kit ?  Well, we need rent money !  Another 200 dollars ?  Work out... Work out what ? What are we gonna work out ?  You took it while I was sleeping ?  Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit.  Irritate you ? Irritate you ? I just saw a girl pulled out of a Dumpster.  Don't you want to get out of here ?  What ?  Yeah.  Forgive me. I was just taking a rest here. Besides, she's new.  Williams.  Back off, Kit. You know, you're really becoming a grouch.  Yes. Sometimes.  It's looking really slow tonight.  And then he'll run our lives and take our money. No.  Do you think I look like Carol Channing ?  Wait a minute. That's a Lotus Esprit.  Take care of you. KIT (voice over) Work it. Work it, baby. Work it ! Work it. Own it.  Hey, sugar, you looking for a date ?  Sure. For five bucks.  Price just went up to ten.  I can do anything I want to, baby. I ain't lost.  For twenty, I'll show you personal. Even show you where the stars live.  Right. Uh, down the street.  Let's go. CARLOS (voice over) Hey, where you going, baby ?  Look, I use condoms always. I get checked out once a month at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I am probably safer.  If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.  What do you want it to be ?  Vivian. My name is Vivian.  Man, this baby must corner like it's on rails !  Well, doesn't it blow your mind ? This is only four cylinders.  Road and Track. The boys back home I grew up with, they were really into American heavy metal : Mustangs, Corvettes.  They bought them cheap and fixed them up. I paid attention. So how is it you know so little about cars ?  Oh.  Milledgeville, Georgia. You know, I think you left your transmission back there. You're not shifting right. This is a standard «H».  No.  You're joking.  Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you for the ride of your life. I'm gonna show you what this car can really do. Are you ready ?  Hang on.  Here we go.  This has pedals like a race car. They're really close together. So it's probably easier for a woman to drive, because they have little feet. Except me. I wear a size nine.  You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to your wrist ?  Did you know that ?  It's a little bit of trivia.  Can't take less than a hundred dollars.  For an hour.  I never joke about money.  Well, no. But it's got potential.  Ah. You're here.  Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab with my twenty bucks.  Yeah. My office. Yeah.  See you.  No, I like the bus.  Yeah.  You got it.  What is your name ?  Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world !  I tell you what, this is fate, Edward. That's what this is.  Why ?  Ah.  Wow ! EDWARD (voice over) It's all right. VIVIAN (voice over) Holy shit.  Good evening, Mr. Lewis.  Yes, we have several.  Of course.  Room service for Mr. Lewis, please.  Oh, honey. You know what's happened ? I've got a runner in my pantyhose.  I'm not wearing pantyhose.  Well, color me happy ! There's a sofa in here for two.  Sorry, I couldn't help it.  The penthouse. Mmmm !  Oh.  You kidding me ? I come here all the time. As a matter of fact, they do rent this room by the hour.  Why don't you go out there ?  You are ?  So how come you rented the penthouse ?  Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do with me ?  No ?  Well, do you plan everything ?  Yeah. Me too.  I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of «fly by the seat of my pants» girl. You know, moment to moment. That's me. That's... Yeah.  Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe break the ice.  Cash works for me, yeah.  Well, that's one I haven't been on before.  All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you say ? Hmm ?  I'm a safety girl.  All right, let's get one of these on you.  Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh, business or pleasure ?  Business, you think.  Well... let me guess.  That would make you... a lawyer.  Mm-hmm.  You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you.  I've known a lot of everybody.  What is that ?  Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load off.  Hi.  Where would we like it ?  Excuse me !  What are you looking at ?  What is he looking at ?  A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh. (in a much softer voice) Stupid.  You mind if I take my boots off ?  So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ?  Where are they ? Shopping together ?  Why ?  Oh, groovy.  Pretty good. Don't you drink ?  Listen, I... I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've got going, but let me give you a tip : I'm a sure thing, okay ? So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it along ?  Great, let's get started.  Stay here ?  Three hundred dollars.  Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night ? I mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way.  Why ? Is it your birthday or something ?  I mean, I have been the party at a couple of birthdays.  So what do you want me to do ?  I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to me.  Uh... I said I'd be out in just a minute.  Nothing.  I don't do drugs, all right ? I... I stopped doing drugs when I was fourteen.  Yeah ? So ? I had all those strawberry seeds. And you shouldn't neglect your gums.  Thank you.  Are you gonna watch ?  Thank you.  Yeah, well, you're lucky. Most of them shock the hell out of me.  You're watching.  I have a little carpet picnic here. Are you sure you don't want a drink ?  What do you want ?  Everything. But I don't kiss on the mouth.  Hi.  Red.  Y...You didn't wake me. I can see you're really busy. I'm gonna be out of here in just a minute.  Thanks.  Yeah, too good. VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace) I forgot where I was.  Yeah. Did you sleep ?  You don't sleep, you don't do drugs, you don't drink, you hardly eat. What do you do, Edward ? Because I know you're not a lawyer.  Oh.  So what do you do ?  What kind of companies ?  If they have problems, you must get them for a bargain, huh ?  A billion dollars ?  Wow. You must be really smart, huh ?  I only got through the eleventh grade. How far did you go in school ?  Your folks must be really proud, huh ?  So you don't actually have a billion dollars, huh ?  And you don't make anything.  And you don't build anything.  So what do you do with the companies once you buy them ?  Here, let me do that.  You sell them ?  So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars and selling them for the parts, right ?  Well, I screwed the debate team in high school.  I had a grandpa ! He was nice to me. He liked ties on Sundays. Mind if I, um, take a swim in your tub before I go ?  If you want to impress me... PHILIP (voice over on the phone) What is that ?  Oh-oh-oh...  Got to be too flirty, Mama...  I just want your extra time and your...  Kiss...  Uh-uh, you can't be too flirty, mama.  I know how to undress me Mm-hmm... VIVIAN (singing in voice over) Yeah, baby... VIVIAN (singing in voice over) I want to be your fantasy. Well, maybe you could be mine.  Mm-hmm You just leave it. All up to me.  Don't you just love Prince ?  Don't you knock ?  What do you want ?  Really ?  Look, I'd love to be your «beck and call girl», but, uh, you're a rich, good-looking guy. You could get a million girls free.  If you're talking twenty-four hours a day, it's gonna cost you.  Six full nights, days too. Four thousand.  You want days too.  Three thousand.  Holy shit !  Yes.  Yes !  You really should think about traveler's checks.  Like what ?  Boring.  Can I call you Eddie ?  I would've stayed for two thousands.  Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice, you're never gonna wanna let me go.  But I'm here now.  Three thousand dollars !  Oof !  I called and called. Where were you last night ?  Oh, man. Are you ready for this ? The guy ? The Lotus ? I am in his hotel room in Beverly Hills. The penthouse. His bathroom is bigger than the Blue Banana !  Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week. And you know what he's gonna give me ?  I swear to God. And extra money to buy clothes.  No. KIT (voice over on the phone) Ugly ?  He's good-looking ! KIT (voice over on the phone) Well, what's wrong with him ?  Nothing.  Well, he gave me three hundred for last night. And, Kit ?  I'm gonna leave some at the front desk for you. I want you to pick it up.  Now, one more thing. Where do I go for the clothes ? Good stuff, on him.  Hi.  Yes, ma'am. May I help you ?  Yeah, I'm leaving this here for Kit De Luca. She's gonna pick it up.  Don't open that.  No, ma'am.  No, sir.  May I help you ?  Well, I'm just checking things out.  Are you looking for something in particular ?  No. Well, yeah. Uh... something... conservative.  Yes.  You got nice stuff.  Thank you.  How much is this ?  I don't think this would fit you.  Well, I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.  How much is this, Marie ?  It's very expensive.  It's very expensive.  Look, I got money to spend in here.  I don't think we have anything for you. You're obviously in the wrong place. Please leave.  Doctor's office ? Two blocks down and to your left.  I'm going to my room.  Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing. I'm on the top floor.  I'm with a friend.  Edward.  Edward... Edward, uh...  He knows me.  That's it. Edward Lewis ! Thanks, Dennis.  What is with everybody today ?  I'm coming. I'm coming.  Vivian.  Yes.  Niece ?  No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried to go... get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women wouldn't help me. And I have all this money now and no dress !  Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this, okay ? I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight. And nobody will help me.  Oh, man, if you're calling the cops. Yeah, call the cops. That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.  Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey, I'll call you the minute it comes in.  Thank you.  Have a nice day.  Thank you.  Hello. You must be Vivian. My name's Bridget.  Yeah, hi. Barney said you'd be nice to me.  He's very sweet. What are your plans while you're in town ?  We're gonna have dinner.  Oh, don't sit on there, dear !  Oh !  You're gonna go out ? Dinner ?  Mm-hmm.  Well, you'll need a cocktail dress then. Come with me.  Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something here that your uncle will love. You're a size six, right ?  Yeah. How'd you know that ?  Oh, that's my job.  Bridg, he's not really my uncle.  They never are, dear.  Barney !  Sorry, mister.  I got a dress !  Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed up ! Listen, I got shoes too. You wanna see ?  Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but Bridget was really great... and I just wanted to say thanks. You're cool.  Hello ?  Then why are you calling me ? EDWARD (voicer over on the phone) Did you buy clothes today ?  I got a dress. A cocktail one. EDWARD (voicer over on the phone) That's good.  Where are you taking me, anyway ?  All right. I'll meet you in the lobby, but only 'cause you're paying me to.  Hello ?  Then stop calling me.  Sick.  Barney !  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Uh... I've got a little problem.  I definitely have the salad fork. The rest of the silverware is a little confusing.  You're late.  You're forgiven.  Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.  Excuse me.  I'm going to the ladies' room.  Okay. Excuse me.  Yeah.  Please do so. Thank you.  Where's the salad ?  That's the fork I knew. DAVID MORSE (voice over) Let me, uh, put it another way. Between your public statements and the rumors flying around on this thing, we find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions are.  Who ordered this ? THE WAITER (voice over) The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appétit.  Slippery little suckers. THE WAITER (smiling) It happens all the time.  I'm sorry too.  He seems like a nice man.  I just mean it's sweet the way he's crazy about his grandson.  It's ketchup.  Haven't they ever seen ketchup before ?  Edward, you said you never come out here.  Didn't say much in the car on the way home. You thinking about dinner ? I was a maniac.  I mean, the business was good, I think. You know ?  He's in trouble. You want his company. He doesn't want to let it go.  The problem is, I think you liked Mr. Morse.  It's making you nervous ? What if I just leaned back a little bit like this ?  Would you... Would you rescue me if I fell ?  It's really high.  Look, no hands, no hands ! Okay, all right. I'm sorry.  I know. Kit's always saying to me, «Don't get emotional when you turn tricks». That's why no kissing. It's too personal.  It's like what you're saying : You stay numb, you don't get involved. When I'm with a guy, I'm like a robot. I just do it.  I mean... except with you.  I was sorry to hear about your dad. When did he die ?  Do you miss him ?  Do you want to talk about this ?  Well, I tell you what, 'cause I got an idea.  Let's watch old movies all night. We'll just veg out in front of the TV.  Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.  Where are you going ?  Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse. The guy that was here, Mr. Lewis, have you seen him down there anywhere ?  I didn't know you played.  I was getting lonely upstairs all by myself.  People always do what you tell them to do ?  I guess so.  Oh ! More shopping.  Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be.  They were mean to me.  People are looking at me.  The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, this is absolutely divine.  Edward would love that tie.  He would go crazy about this tie.  May I help you ?  No, thank you.  Hi.  Hello.  Do you remember me ?  No, I'm sorry.  I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.  Oh.  You work on commission, right ?  Uh, yes.  Big mistake. Big. Huge ! I have to go shopping now.  Wait... Thank you.  How was your day, dear ?  I got it for you.  I would've been angry at the ten thousands dollars.  What'd the shrink say ?  Well, so you got even. That must've made you happy.  Did I mention my leg is 44 inches from hip to toe, so, basically, we're talking about 88 inches of therapy...  ...wrapped around you for the bargain price of... EDWARD & VIVIAN (together) ...three thousands dollars.  Yeah.  What if someone recognizes me ?  You did.  Edward.  So, you're the flavor of the month. Hmm.  Uh, she's just being testy. Edward's our most eligible bachelor. Everybody is trying to land him.  Well, I'm not trying to land him. I'm just using him for sex.  Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo !  Tell me again why we're here.  Business mingling ?  It's always a pleasure meeting one of Edward's girls.  Oh, my God ! It's Tate Whitley Wallington.  Tate ! It's me, Elizabeth, from Workout World.  Real genuine guy. Who is he ?  You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  Are these people your friends ?  Well, no wonder.  No wonder why you came looking for me.  And I do need some help from you ladies and gentlemen in the audience. GWEN (voice over from the P.A.) We need you to help replace some of the divots out here on the grass. GWEN (voice over from the P.A.) So come on out now. ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) Come on ! Come on, folks. ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) You heard her. The stomping of the divots.  She's sweet, Edward. ELIZABETH (voice over) Wherever did you find her ?  Thank you.  Excuse me.  David.  I'm okay.  It's new. DAVID MORSE (voice over) Yeah ? VIVIAN (voice over) Yeah !  What are you looking at ?  Philip, I'm going to rip off all my clothes and do a naked belly dance for the polo players.  Well, Edward's waiting for me. I don't want to...  Okay, I'll... Just for a second, though.  I didn't know you were playing today.  Yeah, I'm having a great time.  What ?  Yeah, sure. Why not ?  I'm fine.  Asshole ! There's a word.  You know what ? Just tell me one thing : Why did you make me get all dressed up ?  No, what I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker, - why didn't you just let me wear my own clothes, okay ?  I mean, in my own clothes, when someone like that guy Stuckey comes up to me, I can handle it, I'm prepared.  What are you, my pimp now ?  You know, you think you can pass me around to your friends ? I'm not some little toy !  Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay ? I say who. I say when. I... I say who...  I'm sorry I ever met you.  I'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car !  I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today.  I want my money. I want to get out of here.  Come on !  Why ?  We were just talking.  You hurt me.  Don't do it again.  First guy I ever loved was a total nothing. Second was worse. My mom called me a bum magnet. If there was a bum within a fifty-mile radius, I was completely attracted to him. That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number three.  So here I was : no money, no friends, no bum.  I worked at a couple fast food places, parked cars at wrestling. And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed to go home. That's when I met Kit. She was a hooker and made it sound so great. So one day I did it.  I cried the whole time. But then I got some regulars and, you know... It's not like anybody plans this. It's not your childhood dream.  People put you down enough, you start to believe it.  The bad stuff is easier to believe. You ever notice that ?  Do I look okay ?  Mmm ?  Well, nothing else is gonna fit into this dress. I'll tell you that.  Oh !  They really let you borrow this from the jewelry store ?  If you were gonna buy this, how much would it cost ?  A quarter of a million dollars ?  So, where are we going ?  If I forget to tell you later, I had a really good time tonight.  I've never been on a plane before.  We're late.  Okay.  Edward, how are you ?  Hey, come here. You gotta look at this.  If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here ?  Oh !  So, you said this is in Italian.  So how am I gonna know what they're singing. These are broken.  Mine are broken.  Oh.  There's a band !  Mmm.  Did you enjoy the opera, dear ?  Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants.  What ?  Oh !  Why don't you not go to work tomorrow. Take the day off.  Yeah.  Here are the storage reports you wanted, and Mr. Lewis called.  He said he's taking the day off.  That's what he said.  I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor over there. Do you have any money ?  Well, I'm gonna give, um... you'll buy a snap dog. We'll cop a squat under a tree somewhere.  Cop a squat.  Um... There's a club up here that I'd like to stop into for a second to see my roommate, if that's okay ?  Uh, Darryl, can you just pull up into the back alleyway, please ?  I just wanna run in for a minute and see if she's there, so just stay here.  I'm hoping they don't spot this limousine as it is.  Hey, Rachel, have you seen Kit ?  No, not since, uh, Tuesday. Hey, and Carlos is looking for her too. A CUSTOMER (voice over) Hiya, honey, you look great.  Hi, Pops. Thanks. Have you seen Kit ?  Here's my number where I'm gonna be for the rest of the week. Have her call me or come by, okay ?  Thanks.  What's going on out here ?  Let's just leave.  He's a drug dealer. It has to do with Kit. Let's just go, Edward.  He sleeps.  I love you.  Well, you've been pretty tough to take.  You would ?  What else ? You gonna leave some money by the bed when you pass through town ?  How would it be ?  That's just geography.  I don't know. When I was a little girl, my mama used to lock me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. And I would... I would pretend I was a princess... trapped in a tower by a wicked queen. VIVIAN (voice over) And then suddenly this knight...  ...on a white horse with these colors flying would come charging up and draw his sword. And I would wave. And he would climb up the tower and rescue me.  But never in all the time... that I had this dream did the knight say to me, «Come on, baby, I'll put you up in a great condo».  I know. It's a really good offer for a girl like me.  You just did.  Listen, I've been calling you.  You were supposed to come by Tuesday. I left the money at the desk.  Well, if you picked up the money, you wouldn't have to hide.  Well, thanks, but it's easy to clean up when you got money.  Tomorrow.  Yeah. Edward asked me if I wanted to see him again. But I think... I think definitely no. I mean, it's just another week, right ?  Yeah.  What ?  Oh, no, you don't !  No. Kit, please. Stop it.  Kit !  Uh, yeah, yeah... I did.  I did. It was nice.  Look, I'm not stupid, okay ? I'm... I'm not in love with him. I just... I like him.  Yeah.  Who's gonna break my heart, right ?  When does it happen, Kit ? When does it really happen ? Who does it really work out for ? Did it work out for Skinny Marie or Rachel ? No !  I just wanna know who it works out for. You give me one example of somebody that we know that it happened for.  Yeah, one person that it worked out for.  Yeah. I'd like to know.  Edward's not here. I thought he was with you.  No.  No, thank you.  Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home.  Hey, get off me !  Ow !  Get off me ! Ow ! Get off me !  Get off me ! Get off me !  Wham ! And it feels like your eye is gonna explode. What do they do ? Do they pull you aside in high school and show you how to do this ?  Is that... Ow !  I heard about what you did with Morse.  It was good.  I think this is okay.  I gotta get going.  Edward, there'll always be some guy, even some friend of yours, thinking he can treat me like Stuckey, thinking that it's allowed. What are you gonna do ? You gonna beat up everybody ?  Look, you made me a really nice offer. And a few months ago, no problem. But now everything is different, and you've changed that. And you can't change back. I want more.  I want the fairy tale.  You're welcome. If you ever need anything... dental floss, whatever... you give me a call.  I had a good time.  No, I got it.  Thanks.  I can't.  I think you have a lot of special gifts.  Hi, Barney.  I wanted to say good-bye.  Come on, Barney. You and me live in the real world... most of the time.  I'm gonna call a cab.  Stay cool.  I'll wear a sweater.  Get a job. Finish high school. I got things I can do. I used to make pretty good grades in high school.  Sure you won't come with me ?  Come here.  It's part of the Edward Lewis scholarship fund. We think you got a lot of potential, Kit De Luca.  Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody tell you different, okay ?  Take care of you.  An hour.  Whoa.  She rescues him right back. THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over) Welcome to Hollywood. What's your dream ?
