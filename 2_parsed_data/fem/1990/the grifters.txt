I will. So long, Bobo. Well, you can tell them I said they're right. I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am. You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller. Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big. A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo? Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice. He's a good kid. A salesman. Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez. Oh, thanks, Bobo. Permanent damage. It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh... You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies. You mean, the insurance frammis? No. You're calling the shots. It'll never happen again. I swear. I never fucked up before, Bobo. He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick. My son was in the hospital -- My son -- Bobo, no, I -- I want to keep my teeth. I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those-- I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo. Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for. Hi, Bobo. And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call. Fine. Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there? Do you have something around back, facing away from the road? I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night. Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight. Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house. I like you, too. Roy? He's always crying. My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed. You know who I work for. Well, make it stop! What? He's going to be all right! Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way. I know. Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here. Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at -- I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it? Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related? ) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power. A future. The only future I've got. And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game. Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different. Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him. If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age? That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know. You're getting off the grift? I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money. And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy. No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up. I wonder did you ever think about it from my side. A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was. Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid. I know what's bugging you, of course. You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live. I'll get it. No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water? You want a drink? And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this. Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive. Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo -- What? Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there. A job? I've never had a legit job in my life! At what? Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that? Just a few bucks. I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead. I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but -- It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and -- I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain? As though you do what I say. No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me? She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash? Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure. Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check. I've really got to -- Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding? Somewhere else, that's for sure. Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down. It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know. You, too, Roy. After the meet. Back to Baltimore. I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another. No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air. No. That was the point. You do? Roy, I don't want money from you. What's that? If you come out to the track, don't know me. Roy! What are you doing in San Diego? I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you. You don't have the stomach for it. Get off the grift, Roy. You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy? He let me live. He let me be his friend. I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me. It didn't. That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out. The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be. My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down. No. And you have to be. That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you -- You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book! And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls! Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that? Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called. Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh? Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them. You always did. Don't mention it. Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track. I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks. Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son. Only one tooth? Only one arm? So what's your story today?Where's the five? You're too young. You should be in school. Scram. Go home. I didn't teach you that.Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you? It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation. Cole, it'll be all right. Honey? Henry, no! We're not really interested, Henry. Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring. So here we are! Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has-- -- you don't mind my telling him, darling -- -- suffered reverses. If he could... Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing -- Goody! Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything. Wouldn't I, darling? Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients! You are seeing it. You're looking right at it. I have only one thing now. Are you interested? It's not your fault. All right. It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all? But they must be! They cut glass! What is? But what's wrong? Why? What's wrong? We'll work something out, Joe. I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten? Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink? Joe, you know you'll -- Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more -- You heard the shower, didn't you? I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like -- Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh? Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other. By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly. What is it? What's going on? Bullshit! For Christ's sake, why not? What? No! Because I -- You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day. But the setup's there. It's there now. What? I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position -- You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds. But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back? You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy. I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us. I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is. I saw her. I went out to Delmar. ) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah! Open it and find out. Open your door. You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out. Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over. Think about it. Okay? Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand? I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole. Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... Atascadero. Upstate. He retired. Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year. No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off. No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole. He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker! He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark. It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game. It was beautiful. And getting better all the time. I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley. The long end. Big con. Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square. You're on the grift. Same as me. The tap. What you do for a living. Oh, come on, Roy. I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys. You already went back to work. I'll sign that affidavit. No. Big spender. What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there? I don't see why we have to take the train. I'll see you when you get home. Get well soon. You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth. And you never defend me. You're afraid of her. I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks. Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you. You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you. I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me. I want to know everything about you. Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you. You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had? No, baby. Come to Mama. I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material. No more than this? Roy? It this all we have? Look at me. Roy? Are you sure? You aren't taking me for granted, are you? Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
