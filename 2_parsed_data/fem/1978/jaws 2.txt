What is it? Too hot in the lighthouse? The lighthouse? Over here. I want you to meet somebody. Shells and lobsters and stuff? That's awful. It's all right, we're okay. Shh. Shhh.... Tide doesn't turn for three hours. I told you, remember? You going to fool around with Mike? Well, I'm not doing anything with him. The lighthouse is a make-out spot. That's you. Mike! Are you going out? She just likes to tease. I think she really likes you. I want you to meet my cousin. You're not going out right away, are you? My cousin will be here tomorrow. Seventeen. She's a senior.Okay, okay, coming.... Terry! You okay? Ready? Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally. Not when it's like this. This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite. It's either a Great White, or another killer whale. Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further. Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration. And sound. Probably. This is a mammal, not a fish. What makes you think there might be? Okay, so that's it. Carcharadon Carcharias. Do you? Could be a shark. But maybe not. You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay? We don't know that, do we? What shark? The whale's mouth? The what? Length, 22 feet, 8 inches. First things first. After we've looked, we'll talk.What is it? What's the matter? What're you doing? Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work. I'll give notice. What're you going to do today? I know you did.... They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them every- thing. For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island.... Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is. What did they.... Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened! Because of today? The beach? That you were fired. What? What's wrong? Sean's asleep. Hi. I closed a sale today, without Len. That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through. Are you going to be able to sleep? It was bad, wasn't it. Do you? All summer? Terrific. Oh. Want to talk about it? Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'? Nothing, huh? Careful. What's wrong? Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you? Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring. Thank you. I'll tell him. It's an island. Got to run. One what? Ah-ha! Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up? Where's my day book? Eat Cheerios. So's a donut. You have to smoke so early in the morning? Hey! That's my boss! As far as the office. Mrs. Silvera. Door's locked. MMMmmmorning.... Let's get the kid home. Fooling around? And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me. Why? My boss and your boss. Sure. I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal? Where the hell were you? Be careful.... Hurry, please. I'm going. Mike? Our Mike? What Kids? Who went out?I'm supposed to. I can't wait to get there. When do we get to the lighthouse? My hair's getting wet! I want to go faster! Wheee! Faster! Great! Find one for me. For me...? Come on, you guys. You going to the lighthouse? What? How fast does this go? We're going to die. It killed her. It ate her. What's wrong? Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing it now? Now I really want to see it. I've never been supercargo. Is that me? What's wrong? I love it. That's fun! Let's race for some- thing! I thought you were grounded. Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody! You do everything your parents tell you? No way. Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so. It'll be fun, come on! I'd like to go out to the light- house with you. We'll be over by the lighthouse. Is there something I don't know about? Great. I got some wine. What's the lighthouse?But the island! But we had it! We were headed right for it! Listen to Andy, Sean. Where're we going? Sean, baby, please.... Heading back? Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch. What about me? Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone! Faster! Faster! Coming about, then. Who wouldn't. Not tonight. I don't think she's such hot stuff.It's still there! No! It's still there! N-o-o-o-o-o-o.... Chief Brody -- can we go? Please? That you'll put down a blanket. I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them. Wait a minute. Promise me something. And second? What're we going to do in the mean time? What about the others? It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful. What about sailing? You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this? Double nope! Nope. With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow? Eddie, can we do that? Can we go skiing? We can use my Uncle's boat. Eddie? Take a break for a minute, okay?
