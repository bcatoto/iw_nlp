You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it. Did you ever think life would turn out like this? He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick! Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing. Oh, sure... Twice a day. Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up. Sure. Why not. I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad. You're back.Wait! First I give you special fuck! You call me Linda, just like home. You like to call me Linda now? I show you. Come. You come. Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right? How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda? I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much! Everybody love Linda.I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine. I'm just so lonely. I don't know. That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air. I see you're going hunting. You're going hunting? What are you doing? Nick? Nick. It's okay... It's okay. I have to go now. No-o-o! Oh, it's great. Fine. Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk -- Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now. Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee. Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out. Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from. I made you a sweater. Here... You have to take that off. But -- Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound? How are you? Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so! I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car... I thought someone stole you away! I don't know. Sure. I don't know! I don't know either! Okay. What? I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking -- I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking -- I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because... Oh... You know... Hi. Nick, your shoes are soaking.Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home. Sal! Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything? Right here. Right here. Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand? You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this. Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it. You can do it, Sal. Who the hell knows! I like it, Nick. How's Linda? Sit down. Nick!... I thought you went home. When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up. I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun. Three bullets -- minimum. Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got! More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other. We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way. We gotta play with more bullets. LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO! Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you! I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick. Forget Sal. Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!! Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out! I suppose you wish you were somewhere else? I thought you might be praying. What are you, hoping? Listen, asshole, it's up to us! I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come. Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know. Tomorrow I go with Vince. Hey, Nick? It's ahead, by the tree. Promise! You gotta promise! I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that. Yeah. You think we'll ever come back? Hell no! Oh. Pow? What'd he say? Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son! Nick, he just came back. Yeah. When it comes to hunting, that's true. Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do. I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo. What do you think about? You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it. Fucking A. So do I. I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind. You think about it? You do? I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year. I just wait. You know? That way it sets. You should have put that on last night. Right. There's Vince! This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this! You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own! That's it. No. No way. No. No. Sure I got boots. I got boots right here. Watch it, shithead! How much? How much do you wanna bet? You wanna bet?
