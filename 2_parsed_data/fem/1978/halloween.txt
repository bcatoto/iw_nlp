He shouts, too. Huh? You blame everything on kids. What happened? Hi, Dad. What happened? Saving the treats for Bob? What time? All right. The Wallaces leave at seven. I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda. Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight. We just talked. That's not true. Here I am. Why didn't you wait for me? He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so. If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning. He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul. I can't. This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window... You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up. You guys will make a fabulous couple. Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him. What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night? I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like. For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her. I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout. What's the pumpkin for? That's probably all he can do. Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven. Probably Mister Riddle. Lies. You still spooked? Bye. I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30. Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie. I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me? Of course. Why did you hang up on me? Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later. It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much. Poor Laurie. You scared another one away. Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep! I don't see anything. Look where? Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you. I have a place for that. I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me... Come with me. Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other... Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul. Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off? I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck. Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room! Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again. Get him out of here!You're going to be late! You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie. The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you? Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids. What? Hi, Annie, Laurie... Where? Where were you? I went back to the Myers house... I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out. More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse. Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes. You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong. Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this... You all right? I'll check back in an hour. I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations... What do we do? Looks like to me you're just plain scared. A man wouldn't do that... Come on... A skunk could have killed it... Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted. Ten minutes. May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here... Lee Brackett.Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded. Wait a minute here... Yes, you can. I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around. Fancy. Annie! Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't. I'd say you must have the wrong number. What's this big, big news? Thanks. I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied. He can still watch. He was watching me. I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard. I wasn't spooked. Sure, see you later. I've already lost it. I thought it was an obscene phone call. Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death. Annie, was that you? Hello? Okay. Bye. The guys think I'm too smart. Cute. He was standing right here. That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at. Behind that bush there. Look. I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company. I forgot my chemistry book. Shit! Exploring uncharted territory? What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling. Have a good time. They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed. No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul. Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight. Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble. I don't think so... I thought you were babysitting tonight. As usual, I don't have anything to do. I think you have too much to do tomorrow. No! Do as I say. I killed him... Yes. Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside. HURRY! DO WHAT I SAY! NOW! Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door! Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs... Tommy, let me in! I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed. Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey. I promise. And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you. We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right? What did he look like? There was no one outside. Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe. Do you believe everything that Richie tells you? There is no such thing. After the Jack-O-Lantern. After the movie. I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him... 'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'... Why are they under there? But king Arthur was always your favorite. ..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..." See you. Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade. Just watch. Yes, I am. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Same time, same place. Hi, Tommy. Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand? Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door. There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed. You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie. Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?Yes. I want to stay here and watch this. I don't want to. I don't know. I'm scared. You locked yourself in. Annie, Paul's on the phone! No, he's not. Here, Lester. You're coming with us... I'm scared! Let's make more popcorn. Okay. She's washing her clothes. Yes, she is. Hello.Fun-ny. See you. I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating. Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week. Well, are we still on for tonight? Sure. It's been totally charted. We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up. YEAH? Go get me a beer. Is that all you say? Want a beer? Fantastic. Totally. I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble. That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to... And I can't keep you interested? Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note. Totally... You idiot! Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it? Okay. Later. Well, she's totally not here. Is Annie around? Hi, Laurie, what's up? Totally. Isn't that David Graham? He's cute. The only reason she babysits is to have a place to... It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you. TOTALLY! It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!I don't think this is any time to be funny... What did he say? Shouldn't we pick him up? The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on... You don't have to make this harder than it already is. What does that mean? Only minimum security. Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor. I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.' Are there any special instructions? He'll barely be able to sit up. What did you use before?Promise? Will you call me tomorrow? Michael's around someplace... My parents won't be back till ten.
