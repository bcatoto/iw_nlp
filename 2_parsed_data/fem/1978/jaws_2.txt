Where the hell were you? I can see that. Don't you know this  is a big deal? I don't think she's such hot stuff. Not tonight. Mrs. Silvera couldn't come. My boss and your boss. Sure. Watch Sean for a minute? Seventeen. She's a senior. That's awful. My cousin will be here tomorrow. Why? And how. I thought you wouldn't  respect me. Fooling around? Let's get the kid home. MMMmmmorning... Door's locked. Put a towel down. And shh -- daddy's  sleeping. C'mere... Mrs. Silvera. As far as the office. Writing a ticket. Hey! That's my boss! Do I have to? See you later. Bye, Mr. Brody. You're not going out right away, are  you? I want you to meet my cousin. Shells and lobsters and stuff? Brooke! Hey! Over here. I want you to meet  somebody. How fast does this go? What? Far out! Is that me? That's you. I've never been supercargo. Black, two sugars. One petty theft, one domestic  disturbance, and an exhibitionist. Chief Brody? I want you to do  something about my first husband. Sure. They like to play. We may see  some today. Ready? Take a break for a minute, okay? Eddie, can we do that? Can we go skiing? We can use my  Uncle's boat. Eddie? With you, everything's next week. I  want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow? Terry! You okay? Okay, okay, coming... Terry! Help! God, help! No-o-o-o-o-o...! We heard this noise, like a 'boomp'  out there, and when we looked, there  was just this cloud of smoke. That was the explosion. One minute  they were having a wonderful time,  the next, bang! I don't know what could've done that. Can we go now? Chief Brody -- can we go? Please? You have to smoke so early in the  morning? So's a donut. Eat Cheerios. Where's my day book? He doesn't have to work all the time,  it's his vacation. Good morning -- everyone up early  today? Why don't you take a half day and  clean this junk up? One what? Ah-ha! It's an island. Got to run. You can come with me to the market. Where're we going? The lighthouse? Oh, sure, they would be. What's the lighthouse? Great. I got some wine. The lighthouse is a make-out spot. Now I really want to see it. You going to fool around with Mike? Well, I'm not doing anything with  him. Well, maybe I will, then. Nope. Double nope! Too hot in the lighthouse? Is there something I don't know about? I told you, remember? Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing  it now? He's cute... Yech! We'll be over by the lighthouse. See you later, Mikey... Thank you. I'll tell him. Sort of -- Matthew Hooper is aboard  the research vessel Aurora, presently  in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be  in radio range until half-past next  spring. Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family  affair. Where were you? Careful. What's wrong? Nothing, huh? Use the little brush there. Why were  you at Santos'? Oh. Want to talk about it? Terrific. All summer? Not so loud! Do you? It was bad, wasn't it. Are you going to be able to sleep? During the summer, the sun sets right  there... Over the water. Beautiful. A piece here, a piece there, it all  adds up. His job. This is fun! Can we go faster? Yay! Renee wants to know what that man is  doing way up there? For what? It's a shark tower. I saw one in  Florida. He's looking for sharks. Okay. Folks, if we could get back  on, we'll show you the country club,  and stop for lunch... Martin! No! It's okay. It's over... Let's go, everyone... Mrs. Bryant,  Len, please... But that's not rational behavior! Hundred! Literally hundreds. What  are they going to say about us? Hi. I closed a sale today, without  Len. That's $1200 commission, if the  papers go through. Sean's asleep. What's wrong? What? That you were fired. Because of today? The beach? Stop that! We're not going any place.  You love it here. Tell me what the  hell happened! Honey, this is nothing... I don't  know what it is. What did they... They have no right to treat you like  that. You've given them everything.  For four years, you've protected  this town, the people on this  island... I know you did... You're drunk is what you are... Take it easy... Easy... Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's  sleeping. Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed. It was okay. Who wouldn't. Now? At night? All-right. Let's go for it. Mike, you going? Anyone want a coke or anything? I'd like to go out to the lighthouse  with you. It'll be fun, come on! No way. Everybody's going sailing.  If you don't want to take me, just  say so. You do everything your parents tell  you? Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody! I really want to to be there. Who's bringing the wine? And who's  got a quarter for the box? She just likes to tease. I think she  really likes you. What're you going to do today? I'll give notice. Morning. Anything special today? Frankie. He's my cousin. Have a nice day. This guy giving you any trouble? You want to go out in my boat? Sure. Mike! Are you going out? I thought you were grounded. You going to the lighthouse? Is there room on your boat for all  of us? Great. That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy. Sure. I'm ready. Come on, you guys. Please come with us? For me...? Great! Find one for me. You want to tack, or just leave her  pointed up like this? What about sailing? It'll take us to Budapest if you're  not careful. What about the others? What're we going to do in the mean  time? And second? Wait a minute. Promise me something. That you'll put down a blanket. I've  got black and blue marks all over my  butt, and my Mom's getting uptight  about them. Faster! Faster! Coming up. Wheee! Faster! I want to go faster! Don't let him pass. Faster! My hair's getting wet! When do we get to the lighthouse? I can't wait to get there. Hey -- it's not your job any more.  I'm going to be late for work. What Kids? Who went out? Mike? Our Mike? What're you doing? I'm going. I'll do it. Hurry, please. Starving. Let's go eat now. That's fun! Let's race for something! I love it. I'm supposed to. Can't -- we're watching a race! Mike and Larry are racing! Loser  goes home alone! What about me? Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's  turning with the tide. Sailing back  is going to be a bitch. What's wrong? Heading back? Coming about, then. Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody... Michael? Be careful... N-o-o-o-o-o-o... No! It's still there! It's still there! Tina, baby... what is it? Sh... Sh... Shark... What is it? What's the matter? Come back! Martin! My purse is on that boat. Want a lifesaver? How about a skyhook? You okay? What was that? The Amity Police Boat, under full  power, surging through the heavy  swell, Brody very much alone at the  helm. Damn! What's wrong? Tide doesn't turn for three hours. Anyone want to play charades? At least. And an offshore wind. Can't we stop? They're probably looking for us. So all we have to do is land at Cable  Junction and wait. Shhhh. You have to take us off! You have  to! Why don't you take us! No-o-o-o! Sean! Sean, baby, please... It killed her. It ate her. Shh. Shhh... Listen to Andy, Sean. Larry! Can we make it? Dear Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of  God, help us, please... Keep her warm.  Jackie? Baby? God, please help us, Merciful Father,  in Christ's name, we beg you, help  us, please, Dear God, save us, help  us, please, God, help... Can we land on it? If we can get to it. We're going to die. It's all right, we're okay. You bet, kiddo. But we had it! We were headed right  for it! We're going to miss it! But the island! What is it? It's that thing. It's going to kill  us now... We're going to die! Leave her alone! Wait a minute! Listen! Listen! Be careful. I don't want to die! Mommy! I'm bleeding!
