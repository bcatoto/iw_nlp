Your finger? Honey, it's still your night. Allo oui? Yes, he's here. It's your mother. It's bad. You need to go. I'm going with you. I'm going with you. You shouldn't swear. There's ladies  present. Edward, don't! How did you get here? Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up  at the airport. You didn't need to do that. You just  didn't. I'm so glad you're here. You shouldn't have flown. But... It's good to see you. You look  beautiful. Thank you. I'll bet you need to -- Yes. Down the hall on the right. The door  sticks. You have to really pull it. He's up with your father. He's impossible. He won't eat. And  because he won't eat, he gets weaker.  And because he's weaker, he doesn't  want to eat. You don't talk about those things.  Not yet. To the day. You don't think he looks any worse. Get him to drink one of these. He  won't, but tell him he has to. Edward Bloom! He ate my dog! You must have taken a shortcut. Much longer. That rhymes! There's leeches in there! What did she look like? Was she nekkid? It's not a woman, it's a fish. No  one ever catches her. Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent  people. My daddy said it looked like  the coon dog he had when he was kid,  back from the dead. How old are you? I'm eight. That means when I'm  eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm  28, you'll only be 38. And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And  that's not much difference at all. Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.  We all do. I said you're quite a catch! How are you gonna make it without  your shoes? Promise me you'll come back. Really! That's wonderful. I spent a week in Morocco for the  story. It was incredible. We'll have to pick up a copy. Really. Of course. Yes. Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume  things you don't know. Would you say you understand  Josephine? No it's not. It's exactly the same.  Your father and I met, we dated, and  we married -- we chose each other --  because we understood each other on  some fundamental level. Just the  same as you two. Yes, you both think William Bloom is  a very smart man. The problem is, you only see me as  your mother, and not as someone's  wife. And I've been his wife longer  than I've been your mother. You can't  discount that. I know it's not easy. Just remember,  he didn't choose to be your father  and you didn't choose to be his son.  You just ended up together. You could  pick numbers out of a dark bag and  it'd be just the same. If you ask  me, it's a wonder parents and children  can stand each other at all. Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not  the mystery you're trying to solve  right now. Before I forget, your father has  papers in the basement I'd like you  to go through. I wouldn't know what's  important. Was she one of your teachers? Do you know who that is? Hi. How are you feeling? What were you dreaming about? That's terrible. No, I understand. Stop. Can I take your picture? Please? I have photos from the wedding to  show you. There's a great one of you  and my father. I had an extra print  made. I want to see pictures of your  wedding. I've never seen any. I never knew. Oh, so this is a tall tale? I'm sorry. No I'm sorry, I... I'm engaged to be  married. But you're wrong. I do know you, at  least by reputation. Edward Bloom  from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged  to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He  was a few years older than you. Stop it. It's not funny. That poor  boy. Daffodils? How did you get so many? You don't even know me. It's Don. Promise me you won't hurt  him. Stop it! Don! I will never marry you. He's almost a stranger and I prefer  him to you. How can I convince you to stop? Okay. I thought you said you didn't have a  church wedding. Is it the medicine that's making you  thirsty? You were talking about your wedding. I like your stories. Hello Jing. You weren't alone. Tell your men not to bother us! And  lock that door! Bob Hope? I talked with your father last night. You never told me how your parents  met. What about the details? How they  fell in love. The Circus. The War.  You never told me any of that. But it's romantic. Mmm, what? Do you love your father? Do you love him? But it's not true. You're not. I am always on your side. And I think  you should talk to him. The tree fell on the car, spilling  the syrup, which attracted the flies,  which got stuck to it and flew off  with the whole car. I'm going to get started on dishes. I'll help you. Your father decided he needed to  have an office, and it wouldn't do  to have it in the house. You'll know  better than me what's important. It was during the war. Your father  went missing. They thought he was  dead. Not everything your father says is a  complete fabrication. I'm going to check on him. I need to lie down for a bit. It's not that, it's just... ...there's no money. We're completely  bankrupt. You gotta promise you won't tell  anybody. I see. We need to get you one of  those plant misters. We can spray  you like a fern. I don't think I'll ever dry out. He just fell asleep. Josephine's  with him. Yes? I suppose your grandmother's house  when she passed on. But we sold that  right away. Your cousin Shirley bought  it. Heavens no. We had a hard enough  time keeping the mortgage on this  place. Go back to the start. Right hand  only. Oh. Oh. I wasn't expecting you. I am. And you're Will. I've seen  your picture, that's how I recognize  you. I almost said something at the  store, but it would have been awkward. Like this. Listen, Kenny. Why don't we skip the  lesson today? We can go again next  week. I won't tell her if you won't. This was on his sales route, so he  was through here all the time.  Everyone in town knew him. Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was  expecting to dance around this for  another half hour. Can I ask you a question? Why did  you come here today? If you found  this deed, why didn't you just ask  Eddie? Look, I don't know how much you want  to know about any of this. You have  one image of your father and it would  be wrong for me to go and change it.  Especially this late in the game. The first thing you have to  understand, is that your father never  meant to end up here. And yet he  did, twice. The first time, he was  early. The second time, he was late. Those days, your father was working  for himself. If there was one thing  you could say about Edward Bloom,  it's that he was a social person,  and people took a liking to him. One  night he was returning from three  weeks on the road, when he hit a  thunderstorm unlike any in his life. Fate has a way of circling back on a  man, and taking him by surprise. A man sees things differently at  different times in his life. This  town didn't seem the same now that  he was older. A new road had brought the outside  world to Spectre, and with it, banks,  liens and debt. Almost everywhere  you looked, people were bankrupt. Two different corporations were  looking at buying the town, if they  could get the price low enough. One  wanted to open a chicken processing  plant. The other, a municipal dump.  Either way, Spectre would be  destroyed. And so Edward Bloom decided to buy  the town, in order to save it. He was never a wealthy man, but he  had made other men rich, and now he  asked for their favors. Most of them had never seen Spectre --  they only had Edward's words to  describe it. That's all they needed.  He sold them on the dream. You can structure it as a historical  trust. But you'll need every  contiguous piece of property. It's  all or nothing. So first he bought the farms. Then  he bought the houses. Then he bought  the stores. Whatever he bought, the people were  not asked to leave or pay rent or  anything. They were just asked to  keep doing as they were doing. In  that way, he could make sure the  town would never die. Within six months, his trust had  purchased the entire town. With one  exception. You must be Edward Bloom. No one would come out here unless  they had business. And no one would  have business with me except for  you. You're buying the town. So I've heard. Now let me get this straight. You'll  buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay  in it. You'll own the house, but  it'll still be mine. I'll be here,  and you'll come and go as you please  to one place or another. Do I have  that right? Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If  nothing is going to change, I'd just  as soon it not change in the way it  hasn't been changing all this time. Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this  land? Some sort of midlife crisis?  Instead of buying a convertible, you  buy a town? I'm not convinced you should be happy. No, you did exactly what you promised.  You came back. I was just expecting  you sooner. I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that  was a big difference. I won't be selling you this house,  Mr. Bloom. It's okay, just leave it. Please. Go. Just go. Go. Most men in that situation would  accept their failure and move on.  But Edward was not like most men. As the months passed, he found more  and more things to fix, until the  shack no longer resembled itself. You can leave it there. I know. Lucky girl. Wait! Edward! One day, Edward Bloom left, and never  returned to the town he'd saved. As for the girl, the common belief  was that she'd become a witch, and  crazy at that. She became something  of a legend herself. And the story ended where it began. No, it's logical if you think like  your father. See, to him, there's  only two women: your mother and  everyone else. Well, therapy. And one day I realized  I was in love with a man who could  never love me back. I was living in  a fairy tale. People aren't like they are in  stories. They hurt each other without  meaning to. They are kind and  unbelievably cruel at the same moment.  Like me, now. I'm not sure I should  have told you any of this. I wanted to meet you for the longest  time. I did. I envied you so much. The way Eddie  would talk about you when you were  at Missouri, that award you won.  Congratulations, incidentally. And  when you got the job at the A.P.,  everything, he was so proud of you.  I mean, that's the thing. Every moment  he loved you. And as brightly as the sun would  shine when he was with me, every  time he left it disappeared. I wanted  to be as important to him as you  were, and I was never going to be. I  was make-believe and his other life,  you, were real. You knew that, didn't you? Will! Your father had a stroke. He's  upstairs with your mom and Dr.  Bennett. No. He won't. I'm sorry. I don't suppose one of us could stay  with him. In case he... In case he wakes up, one of us should  be there. That's okay? You'll call if... Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry. It seems every hour I  have to... I know. It was the same when I was  carrying Will. Like clockwork. Do you like it, being pregnant? I do. I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but  I loved every minute of it. I did.  Eddie was travelling a lot, so he  was gone, but I felt like I always  had a piece of him with me. A little  part of his soul inside me. I could  feel it. It was alive and kicking. I really miss that. Don't stop. Don't. Security! Stop them!
