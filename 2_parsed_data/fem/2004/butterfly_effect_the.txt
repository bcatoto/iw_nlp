Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with  you! I think you really need to see this. TOMMY! LEAVE LENNY ALONE! DON'T MAKE I was going to show this to the  principal, but I wanted to talk to  you first. Yesterday I had all the children  draw pictures of what they wanted to  be when they grew up. Most of them  made drawings of what their parents  did, but this... Of course. There is one more thing,  Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for  mentioning it... When I asked Evan about his drawing,  well, he didn't remember doing it. Mommy lives far away but she comes  and visits. Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video  camera and we're all gonna be in a  movie. Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin  Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and  you're the Sheriff of Nottingham! You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff. You're better off anyway. We should go soon. If Dad catches us  smoking down here, we're dead. Evan, did I tell you? My mother said  I might be able to visit her this  summer in Orlando with her new family. Where the hell are you taking us  anyway? Just blow something up  already. Oh God... what did we do? I'm sorry. You really don't remember anything  that happened? You're so lucky. Ouch. It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called  dad and blamed us for what happened  to Lenny. I deserve a lot worse. Okay. What do you mean? He's been acting real strange lately.  He won't even look me in the eyes  anymore. Did your mom say if Lenny was...  okay? I think your little homecoming's in  bad taste. Lenny's been through a hell of an  ordeal no thanks to you. Hi, Lenny. So what did you do in there? Do you see that? Do you know what you are? A monster. So... which one of you has a pet  worm? That's so gross. Shit, better explain before all the  excitement gives me a heart attack. So what's the point? So are you planning on becoming a  doctor or something? Smells like sex in here. You're kidding. He's so... big. Most guys tuck their porn under here,  but all you have are... comp books. Wow... read something. Then keep drinking, worm-boy. You're  too uptight. Deal. Now read me something. Come on, go on... Wake up, idiot. It was just a dream. Maybe because they never do. So Don Juan, you pass out on all  your dates? I've got a surprise for you, Lenny.  You'll never guess who's here. How's my sweet girl? Awww, you need  a change, don't you honey? You want to open the door, honey? Oh my God oh my God... God, Evan! I never thought I'd see  you again. How've you been? No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a  long time. Fill me in. I've stopped a hundred times. They kept him in juvy for a few years.  Now he works over at Dale's Autobody. No. I emancipated myself when I was  fifteen. Not if you remember my dad. She had a new family. Not enough  space for me. Said I should have  moved in with her when we were kids.  But... whatever. Me? Are you kidding? Why? Of course. Well, sure. I'll try to remember.  Shoot. What do you want to know, Evan? It was a long time ago. Is that why you came all the way  back? To ask a lot of stupid questions  about Robin Hood? Is there a point to any of this? Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting  your breath. Who are you trying to convince, Evan?!  You come all the way out here to  stir up my shit just because you had  a bad memory!? You want me to cry on  your shoulder and tell you that  everything's all better now? Well  fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be  all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets  better! If I was so wonderful, Evan, why  didn't you ever call me? Why'd you  leave me here to rot?! Don't you ever touch me again. I'm cold. And I'm putting on my  clothes. Honey, are you all right? Oh my God, Evan. You're bleeding!  Look at you! Mmmm... You give good compliment.  Clean up and come back to bed. Those are your clothes, silly. I wish I could get so excited about  a nose bleed. Seriously, Evan. Lay off the blow. Well I remember he had one... but  he, like, put it away after the first  day. Why would that freak me out? Such a goofus. See you tonight. Oh my God, that was good. Where'd  you learn all those new tricks? Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms  weird. Fuck 'em. As if my dad could've stopped me  from seeing you. What's he gonna do  to me? That is the plan, right? Hell or  high water? I don't understand, where are you  taking me? I don't know what to say. It's  beautiful. Why are you doing all this for me? Don't. He's probably watching. It's my fault. I should have told  you he was released a few weeks ago. Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He  wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying  to scare you away from me. It's not his fault, Evan. You knew  how bad he had it when we were kids. My father never laid a hand on me.  It's like the prick saved it all up  for Tommy. Are you okay? It's just... you've been acting kinda  strange, you know? I don't know. You seem... different.  You make weird jokes. Your accents  changed. You don't even walk the  same. I can't put my finger on it, but  everything's a bit off. Even the  dinner tonight. It was beautiful,  but... Wait. Something's not right. Isn't  that your jacket? Tommy. Shut up, Tommy! Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him! No monkey business, Evan. Sit still  and finish your drawing. That's great everyone! Just imagine  anything you want to be. There are  no limits. Evan. Stop it. It's not the time. You're acting crazy! Oh, I thought you were my eight  o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting  someone. If I knew you were coming I'd have  cleaned the stains off the sheets. What do you want? Well, time is money, Evan. So you... Well, I guess I can spare ten minutes  for an old friend, right? So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational  humor. Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work  make you uncomfortable, precious? Ha! Where's that? What's happened to you? I've seen some sickening shit. I  don't blink twice anymore, especially  in your case. Because you're... different. Let me ask you a question. Just a  little one that's been gnawing at me  for years. On the bridge. How did you know that  Tommy had your dog? That was no  fucking hunch. You're right, Evan, I don't believe  you. I'm the only person you've told?  That's a great line. Does that make  other girls swoon? Do they actually  eat up this bullshit? Oh? There's proof now? Anyone with fifty bucks could tell  you that. Know what? There's one major hole in your story. There is no fuckin' way on this planet  or any other that I was in some  fuckin' sorority. Sure you don't want your wallet? Off to change everyone's life again,  is that it? Maybe this time you'll  pop up in some mansion while I wind  up in Tijuana doing the donkey act. Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've  already done so much for me. Hell,  why don't you go back in time and  save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then  maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and  ruin my family. Oh, here's one! Go back when I'm  seven and fuck me in front of Daddy's  handicam, you know, straighten me  out a bit... We have to get you to Sunnyvale.  You're having one of your famous  hemorrhages. What are you geeks looking at? Must  be nice to be so goddamned perfect,  huh? Fucking losers. Let's go for a stroll. You know how spiritual he's gotten  ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and  Katie. Is something the matter? Sure, Evan, why not? You were the  first person I really ever cared  about. That's why when I was little I never  went to live with my mother. When my folks split, they gave me  and Tommy a choice who we wanted to  live with. I couldn't stand my dad,  but I knew if I moved to my mom's  I'd never see you again. It's crossed my mind from time to  time. Well a lot of things cross my mind.  I've always been a fast thinker, Ev.  I can play out the movie of our entire  lives in under a second. Boom -- we  fall in love -- get married -- two  kids, your keen analytical insight  matched to my generous nature --  kids grow old as do we, relatively  stable relationships, matching burial  plots, the whole bit. It took a lot  longer to spit out than to imagine. Why not? But that's not how things  wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's  your friend. And there it ends. When my folks split, they gave me  and Tommy a choice who we wanted to  live with. I couldn't stand my dad,  but I knew if I lived with my mom,  I'd never see you again... What did you say to her? What  happened?!
