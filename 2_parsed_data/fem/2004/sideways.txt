Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"? I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals. It's all in the wrist. You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school? The wallet! He took Derek's wallet! I liked it when you caught me fucking him. I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.Bye. Bye. I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you. Why are you being so defensive? I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important. Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend. The problem with that is that then there's one extra -- Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that -- Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables? Good. That's good. You guys having fun? It'll just take a second.You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged. I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper. Tell him I'll call back. Are you there? Miles? I'm sorry, Miles. So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing. And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call. Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning. How's the trip? Miles.Well, in that case... No, we're paying for the wine. You are not. That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys. Anything I'd know? Oh yeah? What kind of stuff? Are you a writer too? Highliner, please. Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles. Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message. You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine. Yeah. But you wanted to fuck me first. Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to. Do you know what he's been saying to her? Don't touch me. Just take me home. Were you ever going to say anything? What rehearsal dinner? Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend? About two-thirty. You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today. You too. I had class. Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me. Goodnight, Miles. Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course. Okay. See you around. I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did. You know how to get back to the Windmill, right? Yeah. Like what a fraud he was. I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about. What about me? Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you. Can I ask you a personal question? Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos. Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think? Well... I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week. Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it. Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes. Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even. So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...? Oh. You mean... today? What's the title? So what's your novel about? Yeah, weird. But great. It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost. Yeah, same here. You got kids? She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie. Yeah, Siena's a sweetie. I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit. Eighty-eight Sassicaia. I started to get serious about seven years ago. The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion. It might be too late already. What are you waiting for? Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read. You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up... So what gems do you have in your collection? Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs. Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want? Hey. Are you all right? I'm having the salmon. I know. I love that. I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time. Twelve months in oak. Try it. A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc. Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack. Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying? Good for you. So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked. Sure. Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today? I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight? Hey, Miles. Good to see you.I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money? She was good for you. And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right? You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you. I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding? Spray and Wash. That's the one. And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger? I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast. They're just leftovers. Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable. You boys hungry? If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on. Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin. A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special? Miles, when are you going to get married again? Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday. Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids. And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming. Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die! Hi. Maya's in the kitchen. What happened to you guys? I'm thinking about the duck breast. Not so bad yourself. Good. How're you? I know. I might need to be spanked. Sure I know Maya. Real well. Oh yeah. In Santa Ynez. And I agree with you about Cab Franc. Stephanie. That's what people say. Hey, guys. How's it going? You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me? See you, Miles. You take care. Hi, guys. We should probably get going. Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once. Oops. Sorry. Huh. So what are you up to today, Miles? Where's Jack? Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her. That was fun last night. Anything but the Jayer Richebourg! We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever. What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine. Cabernet Franc. This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year. So what do you think?See you over there, Miles. I'm pregnant. Not me. I'm not drinking. I guess. I am. Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do? So what's happening with your book? So how're you doing? Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate. Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband. Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding. I'm going to hang up now, Miles. Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not. Ken. Miles, don't call me when you're drunk. Where are you? Oh, Miles. You're drunk. Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind? Miles? Hello?
