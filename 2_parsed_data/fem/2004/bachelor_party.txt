Make one more move and you'll both  be staying late for the rest of the  week. I didn't hear you. Step away from the curb, children. You're late again, Rick. There can be no excuse for tardiness. All right, stop that... Children, on  the bus. Get going, Rick... you're late enough  as it is. Klupner. Mrs. Klupner. I'm separated. Of course. Huh... What... Oh sure, wait till  this song is over. Right over here. Bobbie, what are you talking about? What's happening? ...Really? Yes, it's true. Ohmygod. Would you get out of here. Really -- you went with him for two  years. He still thinks I'm going with him.  I'm going to break the news to him  tomorrow. No. As far as they're concerned the  only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I  don't care... it's my decision. I'm totally blown away. You're getting  married. It seems like only yesterday  I showed you how to have oral sex. Oh, that's really sweet. I'd love  that. We'll invite all the girls. God, you're a slob. What are we having? I think your dinner's burning. Want to hear something great? Bobbie  and Phoebe are throwing me a shower.  It's really gonna be fun. You're going to have a bachelor party? It looks awful. Are you going to have women at your  party? I'm not talking about does. I'm  talking about hookers. Because from what I've heard, it's a  tradition and you're a traditional  guy. I need you to promise. Cole?... Cole! Cole? Cole, we've got to talk. No, Cole, I... Cole, listen to me... I've got to  tell you... Cole, I'm marrying Rick. I'm not. I just thought I should  tell you myself before you heard it  somewhere else. Cole, I'm sorry, I... I'm going now, Cole. Rick... Mr. Goldsmith, this is my brother-in- law. He's getting married. Nurse, will you take over? I'm so happy for you. You do, Daddy. Er... perhaps we ought to stop now. I'm using the same caterer for the  shower I had for our Christmas party  last year. Great, Mom. If I were you, I'd worry less about  the shower and more about Rick's  bachelor party. Ilene, why would I want to do that?  I trust Rick. Of course you do. I trusted my ex,  Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk  from experience. What do you think  they do at these parties, have tea  and play scrabble? Ilene, Rick promised... Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs. Girls, why don't we go inside for  lunch. Boys, would you mind bringing in  that lemonade? Why is Cole here? You know your father enjoys his  company. You can tell a man by his friends. Cole, what are you doing here? I can't sleep. Stop fooling around... I need to  talk. I don't know... I just feel scared. The wedding, my parents, your family,  our friends, my job, the future, our  relationship, the caterers, my gown,  your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the  apartment, my shower, your bachelor  party... Before or After I have my nervous  breakfown? That feels so great. Um... that's very relaxing. Larry, how are you? You better not have too much joy. Gonna get married... Gee, I really love you... Can't I just go with you guys? Remember, you promised... no screwing  around. You're really pissing me off. Your mother's not dead. Have a good time. Don't make it too  late. I love you. Do you have any more of this dip,  Mrs. Thomerson? It's really excellent. You just ate Purina Cat Chow. Gross me out... What do you think's gonna go on at  the guys' party? What do you mean? You're kidding. Yes? Yeah, hi. Look, is this... 838 North Franek Avenue? Yes. We're here. How nice. I'm Tina Stahl. Of course. Stan's wife... Everyone  come in. Tina! You know everyone here, don't you? Yes. One of these, huh? Looks that way. Buck's a buck. It's so heavy. Is there an empty outlet in here? Are you sure this is a good idea? Look, you heard what those hookers  said. They were supposed to go to a  bachelor party. That doesn't mean it was Rick's party. Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can  have women, we can have men. I don't know about this. C'mon, Mother, it'll be fun. Look at that guy. What a hunk. Let's sit over here. C'mon, Mom. Is this the foot long? She looks up just in time to see the  guys close the kitchen door. Who's first, guys? I had his weiner right in my hands. I told you. Men are pigs... I saw  them standing there. What a gross thing to do... gawd! I bet right now Rick and his pals... ...are knee deep in whores. A strange wang right in my palm. Ilene, we don't really know that. I feel like I'm spying on Rick. Good. That's just what we're doing. I'll kill Stan if I find out he's  been screwing around. Brett, are you with us? Yeah, sure... I was eye to eye with  an unfamiliar pud. Hello. Is there a party going on in there  or something? The name's Tim. I'm always available. Take me... please. Don't go back on your word, Rick. Be  true; be strong. Stay away from me. Think so? I borrowed it from one of  the girls. I don't look too fat? Rivas. Who, me? That's a good question. From the way  I understand it, according to supply  side economics, when supply exceeds  demand, recession is the result.  That's why I think we should control  the credit markets and increase the  prime rate. That way, the consumer  price index will stabilize and we  will have economic recovery. Nah, I used to fuck a librarian. I don't believe we're doing this. Yes, we're looking for the Stahl  party. You're making a big mistake. What kind of job? I'm a housewife. Quiet, Mother. Guys, take it easy. Guys. Make love to me... please. I can't believe it. This is the  happiest day of my life, and I owe  it all to him. C'mon, Mike... Come to Mama. You mean it's... Let's give them what they want. What? Let's go. Everyone inside. Right in here. The big show starts  in one minute. Let's go. Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and  hold them off. The rest of you break  for it! Ilene, are you crazy? I know what I'm doing... Go! Gentlemen, the gods have answered  your prayers... Bonzai! I hope Ilene's all right. I hope those guys are all right. No, not yet. Where is he? Don't turn on the lights, sugar. I'll lead you around. Why don't you get undressed. I can't trust you! Rick, you're lying! Let go of me! The marriage is off. Now you can  screw around with your friends for  the rest of your life. And I want to be with someone who  understands the meaning of the word  commitment. I don't believe you. Yes... Let's get naked. Daddy? Ed! What are you doing here? Ed... you're kinky! You've been having strange sex...! It's all right... So have I. I've seen another man's diddly. Yeah, like you're in the movie with  them. Yeah. You're so romantic... Absolutely amazing. Hi, honey. Rick called me.
