Is this really happening? Because you're afraid! I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now! YOU'RE A LIAR! You're a liar. How... how can... how can you be here and say this? You killed them. Then what? Yes... What? No, I do. It's nothing. It's just a picture. Okay. I speak English.Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now. You do? It wouldn't have changed the way you feel. But you found another choice. I love you, too. Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this. There must be another way! What if it's not who you think it is? Where are you going? -- hang on -- -- it's just him? -- Jesus! -- -- is he back there? -- -- where? - What? -- where's left to go? -- I don't want to move again... I like it here. ...but you're not -- you're not sure... Where -- That's crazy. So... But you're sure? But we were so careful. No... How? One day it will be different. It just takes time. We'll make new memories. You and me. You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over. Sleep. Sleep now. I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it. I worry when you get like this. We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good. -- it hasn't been two years -- You're sure? We should still -- we should write it down. I'll get the book. Where were you, Jason? In the car....it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!... No... Jason... please... You never worked Berlin... Your first assignment was Geneva. No. You never worked Berlin. What do you mean? He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris... Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott -- Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you! And you got to him before we could. It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was. Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national. What is this, a game? They know! They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know! You hear me? I believed you. I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you... Yes. So? I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him. It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know. Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us. I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway. What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out. These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans. You mean, did I want a date? You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice. If you say so. I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown. Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him. Am I a doctor, no, but... Good luck. Before this? Before Bourne? No. Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --No. You lost your way. No good options left? And Danny Zorn, what was that? And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it. 'Why' would be enough for me. I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you. I'm sorry, Ward. Don't know. Did he say anything to you? They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time. Sorry to wake you. Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission. I want the Berlin police fully briefed and -- -- get this out to all the agencies. So what's he doing? You believe him? Don't you want answers? Hold on -- he said he wants to come in. And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him... I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family. What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin! May I finish? Excuse me. ...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars. ...this is Conklin's computer. ...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This... I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off. They were killed by Jason Bourne. And Bourne? Where's he now? So you had Conklin killed. I mean, if we're cutting the crap... I want to know what happened. Let's talk about Conklin. He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward. I want to know about Treadstone. That's not gonna fly. Treadstone. Why you're alive? You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive. Because we want you back on our side. Sounds like a threat. Do you think you can read? Are you well enough? Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie. Are you disappointed? Careful... Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital. Okay, Jason, your move. Who? Okay, how do you want to do it? What do you want? Bourne? What? The tapes? We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes. This stays between you and I. We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it. Alright... take it down. I want to look at the room. Check it out. -- the hotel -- how far? -- -- uplink all relevant files to Kim -- -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone -- Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with. Who's going? Us? And the Germans can't match it? We need to get in there. I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again. How's that scan? For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price. We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop. That's where we came out. Felt promising. It's a start. Let's give him half an hour. Alright... What do you think? Is he coming in? Is it fresh? And why is that? See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from. Some women like Dobermans -- Did you? You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death? Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story. Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through? So he fooled you. Believed what? Are you an expert in amnesia? I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions? You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us. Amnesia? What kind of problems? And what about you, anything? Are we hacking or asking? Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there... By who? Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here? Are we locked up? Anything? What the hell is a "Treadstone?" Do we know what this says?
