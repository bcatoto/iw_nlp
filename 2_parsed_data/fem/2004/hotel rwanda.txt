What was the response? Have you requested re-enforcements? If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed? We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.? Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president? You�re drunk. Let�s go, Jock. Fuck you. Oh my God! What is it? Great. No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then. We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection. We�re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules. Very soon. The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force. Good. I'd like to book a massage. Great, I really need a shower.I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans. Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen. I managed to get the President of France on the phone. Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime. Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over? Can I have your name again?Oh, my babies. What's wrong? Please do not talk like this. What sort of plan? We are almost out of water. Paul! Then another voice. Let me go. Children get off. No! Sit down now. No. Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins. A little longer, Paul? Please, please try one more time. I will not leave without the twins. A Volkswagen! I want to know. What sort of car? Tell me what it was. What was the bribe? What am I worth to you? Why? What? Yes. In Ruhengeri? I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this? Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof? You cannot go alone. No, no. Go out! Where? What's the matter? So where is the lamb? What for Paul. Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please. You could leave, Paul. But who is left? What about us? My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children. Please go back, bring the children to us. He needs to be in a safe place. Have you heard from Mr. Garindi? No, Odette says he's in shock. No answer. Please send someone to get them, please. It will do just fine. I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room. What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me. Paul, don't let them die. What is it, Paul. Oh, my God! Please, Paul, 'til first light. Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence. They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do? I tried already. The phones do not work. Where are Thomas and Fedens? The president has been murdered. Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste. They do not have your connections. Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor. You could have asked for a favor. Why didn't you call your contacts in the army? We must do something. Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake. Do something. Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy. Of course. He wants your wisdom. Yes, with Fedens and the children. I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
