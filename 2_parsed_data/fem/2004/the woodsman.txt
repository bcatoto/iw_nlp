Robin. What does that mean? I'm not pretty. I have friends. It's my bird book. See anything interesting? My daddy likes me home before dark. I have to go. Were you watching me? Not too far. Are you a bird-watcher too? You should hear the bird. Something like that. It's a bright sound. I can't. It's hard to describe. Their sound is quite musical. You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare. When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here. They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy. I don't like starlings. They're starlings. There's little chicks! You want to see? There's a million birds here. What are you looking at?People have the right to know. Lovers' quarrel? Just trying to be helpful. You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean. The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you. I'd keep away from him.Will I see you again? Can't I stay a little longer? I don't mind. Do you still want me to sit on your lap? Walter? I don't want to hurt my daddy. How do you know? But will he... ? What will happen if I do? I can't. Ms. Kramer. Yes. My daddy lets me sit on his lap. They sound like finches. Do you want me to sit on your lap? I'm sure. Thank you all the same. No thank you. What? Yes? Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them. It sounds like you were banished. How come? Do you have many friends? I will be in three months. I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world. I'm twelve. Yeah, like the bird.If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her. Have you seen Walter? Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you? Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice. Why's that? What? Not when they fly. Fucking liar. You okay? Do you want to talk about it? What's going on? What's your fucking problem? Do what? Prove it. Don't be scared, Walter. You're such an asshole. Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine. What's it look like? Fine. Guess that makes you pretty special. Who doesn't? Just think about it. I think it's a fucking good idea. Move in with me. We should live together. Neither am I. You're scared. What? Not ever. Are you serious? I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you. I love my brothers. All three -- in chronological order. I got poked around... here and there. Well, most people are stupid. You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds? What odds? I know. What? Bullshit. And what do you tell yourself now? You really believe that? They seduce you? Is it their innocence? Their beauty?... Why young girls, Walter? My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave. My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories. I'm sorry, Walter. You mean the time you're locked away? Yes! I want to know. What was prison like? You don't molest little girls anymore, do you? Walter. Hey, I'm not -- What? I told you I'm not easily shocked. Twelve years in prison? How young? What did you do to them? How many girls did you molest? You're not joking. Molested little girls? So, what did you do? The worst? Because I like you. Hey, there. I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else? Is that all? Did I say something wrong? Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck. I thought I'd stay the night. How about in the morning. Tell me about it. Since you've had sex? Do you? What's the problem? No you're not. I didn't say I didn't enjoy it. Hey, that was... intense. Not tonight. Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex? So? Don't you think I should know before we have sex? So... what's your dark secret? I'm not easily shocked. Something happened to you. You're damaged. I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else. Yeah, they could. What about them? I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two. My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking. Doesn't it get noisy? Is that a school? You plan to drink both those beers? You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything. Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good. Southern light. What do you think? You never spoke to me before. They're all assholes. You don't hang out with the other guys. You're quiet at work. Guess I'm not like most women. What's weird about that? Very weird. Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore? Yeah, you. I'm talking about you. There's something wrong with this picture. It's fucking freezing out here. Want a ride? Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic. What?
