I will not leave you. Never -- More Power!! Don't let the level  drop!! Grigory! Your eyes. What did they do to your  eyes? The NYPD has yet to issue a statement.  We've got SWAT vans, paramedics, you  name it...  and now here's -- a  garbage truck -- -- a garbage truck? Only seven more days to the eclipse,  Grishka... Move. There's a big red guy down there! Not Santa. Big and red. With gold  eyes. And he has beer! Back so soon? To wash down my lithium pills? I may get a few perks, H.B. But I'm  still a patient. You better have that looked at. No. Not this time, H.B. It's been  months since I've had an episode.  And you know what? I'm learning to  control it. I'm learning where it comes from. And for once in my life I'm not  afraid. Looks like your ride is here. Listen, H.B. I've got a chance out  here. If you truly care about me,  don't come back anymore. Goodnight. I don't like the term "firestarter."  I just don't. And "Pyrokinesis" sounds  like psychosis or something. I dunno --  maybe that's right. Not being able  to let go -- Scary. Sometimes you hear so-and-so  lost control and just exploded. They're lucky it isn't true. With me -- it is. Liz!! Liz!! Come on, darling, give  Mummy a hand. Freak! See? She knows her name. Go home, you freak. We don't want  you here. Not again, please, not again... Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Help me! I'm burning! Help meee!!! Doesn't sounds like him. Choice, huh? That's cute. I've quit  the Bureau thirteen times. I always  go back. Where else would I go? My kittens!! My kittens!!! Thank you -- It feels good to be outside!! It's  been so long... Don't get used to it. It's only for the weekend, Professor  Broom. Then I'll be on my way -- Nothing's changed. Home, sweet home. A little something I learned in  therapy. I'm depressed -- One rubber band. I'm impatient: two  rubber bands... Oh, my God... Look at them all! Who  had babies? C'mere, Tiger...! Well. Is it long?? I'm going out,  but -- For a cup of coffee, but go ahead,  read. No. Myers is taking me. What did you want me to hear -- ? Oh, okay then. Maybe later then. He's just pushy. Cocky. A brute. I know. Don't know. Really. I grew up with  him. I've missed him too, but now, every  time I see him, I get confused. Hardly  a day goes by he's not in my mind.  Even now, I feel he's here -- Coffee's warming me up. You offered me a cup of coffee. I've  got one, so just sit down. I've never seen him like this. Never. Should I stay? With him, I mean? Hi -- I've changed my mind. I'll come to  Moscow. If you -- are still going -- Red, I -- I like that... He is aware. Sparky to Big Red... Come out and see. Marco... What -- ? You want to know -- Now -- ? Here?  Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all  the same. Oh, my God... Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big  Red butt over here! Hit me. Hit me -- All of my life I've run away from  it... Now I want it to happen! Do  it. I know now: I love him. I've always  loved him. Go now. You are the key! The right hand of  doom! What did you think it was made for?  Open the locks. Silence!! Imagine it: An eden for you and her -- Hell will hold no surprises for us. In the dark -- I heard your voice --  What -- did you say -- ?
