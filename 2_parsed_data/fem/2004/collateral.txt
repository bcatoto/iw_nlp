Wow... No, no way, I couldn't take that... How often you go? When was the last time you took one? Just had one. Like you, I'm good at it. But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning. Most of the time. Yeah. Not quite. He did defense. I'm a prosecutor... Bottega. You psychic? Like what? You're an anomaly in today's world, Max. You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...? No? How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money? Why'd you do that?

He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing... ...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.
