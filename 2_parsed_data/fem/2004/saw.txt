This one�s not fresh anymore. At least  three weeks out. (Detective Tapp squints  as he peers in and studies the body)  Victim�s a 46-year old male. (Quick  flash of a crime scene photo, a closeup  of behind the man�s head and upper back.  There are deep cuts all over. The camera  cuts upwards to the detectives.) Died  of massive blood loss. Mostly through  the femoral artery. (The camera pans  around to Detective Tapp, who moves  around the side fo the cage to get a  better look inside, shining his flashlight  in.) He started at the back of the cage  and tunneled his way through the razor  wire so fast it�s amazing he got as  far as he did. Cut himself so deep,  we found traces of stomach acid on the  floor. (Another more gruesome crime  scene photo shot of the body from the  side; we can see the razor wire digging  in under his arm. Also, a close-up shot  of some of his wounds; long, deep cuts.)  We also found this. (She holds up an  evidence baggie with a micro cassette  tape recorder, just like the one Adam  and Lawrence found in their cell. She  presses the play button, and Tapp and  Sing listen. It�s the same chilling  voice from Adam and Lawrence�s tapes.) (stopping the tape) The door was on  a timer. It was unlocked until 3:00.  Then it slammed shut. He was given two  hours. I found something else. Well, two things,  actually. (She moves past them and we  go with her over to a wall where there  is a small hole cut, about an inch or  two in diameter. The light from the  outside shines in.) There was someone  standing outside here watching through  this peephole. Looks like our friend  Jigsaw likes to book himself front row  seats to his own sick little games.  He was there at the last one as well.  (She walks over to Sing and Tapp) Only  this time, he left us his penlight.  (She holds up the penlight in an evidence  baggie, clicking it twice then handing  it to Tapp.) (taking the baggie, moving out of the  room) Copy that. (VO) I woke up. All I could taste was  blood. (The camera moves back quickly,  and we see her tied to the chair, her  wrists bound to the arms of the chair.  She pulls against her bonds, moaning  loudly, trying to speak or cry out but  cannot.) And metal. And then I saw the body. There was a knife. (softly) He...helped me. Diana, Honey, are you okay? (she pushes  back the covers and gets up, crouching  down in front of her daughter. Looking  up at her, she places her hands on her  daughter�s arms.) Diana, Honey, can  you hear me? (very softly, but showing almost no  fear) Mommy? Oh, what is it, sweet pea? (very calmly) There�s a man in my room. (sighing, but not rudely. This is not  the first time this has happened) Oh  Honey, are you sure he�s not just hiding  in your imagination? He talked to me. (sighs) Okay, I�ll come and check your  room. (She smiles a small, assuring  smile) I want Daddy. He�ll get the scary man. (her smile fading a bit) Alright, if  you want. Come on. Larry, sorry to bother you, but your  daughter had a bad dream again. She wants you to check her room. (softly) You know what sweetie? I�ll  go check with you. I�m still scared. I hate that thing. You�re not going to leave us, are you,  Daddy? No one. (very softly) Okay. Good night, Daddy. (with a small smile) Okay. I don�t know how much longer I can do  this, Larry. (pissed, in disbelief) How can you walk  through life pretending that you�re  happy? (confrontational) That is complete bullshit.  (cut to a shot of Diana, laying on her  side in her darkened room, clutching  her teddy bear to her chest. Her eyes  are open, she can hear everything. We  stay with her for the rest of Alison�s  line, her voice now off a bit in the  distance but still very audible) I�d  rather you break down and tell me that  you hated me. At least there�d be some  passion in it. (VO) How can you walk through life pretending  that you�re happy? (pissed) That is complete bullshit.  I�d rather you break down and tell me  that you hated me. At least there�d  be some passion in it. (firmly) Just leave. Diana!? Diana! (opens the door and flips on  the light, gasps when she sees a figure  covered by a blanket looming over Diana�s  bed. The figure suddenly grabs Diana  and she screams, struggling against  him. Alison goes for them. Don�t do that! Leave her! Get away from  her! (through her gag) Keep your motherfucking  hands off of my daughter! (on the phone, sobbing) Daddy? Daddy, is that you? (cut to a shot of  her being held by Zep, the phone to  her ear.) (sobbing) I�m scared, Daddy. She�s here with me. The bad man from my room is here. He  has us tied up and he has a gun. Please come home Daddy! (Zep kisses  her on the top of her head and takes  the phone away to give to Alison.) Larry? Is Adam there? (through her sobs, trying to calm them  and get this message to him) Don�t believe  Adam�s lies. He knows you. He knew all  about you before today. (Zep quickly  takes the phone away, hangs up. Cut  back to the bathroom, Lawrence on the  phone.) I didn�t know if you were going to make  it. (turns, goes and sits on the bed.) It�s not like I know the rules for this  sort of stuff. (She starts unbuttoning  her shirt. Lawrence holds out his hand  and stops her. She looks up at him,  concerned.) What�s wrong, Dr. Gordon? (confused, hurt) But I thought we- No. (She stands, goes over to the phone  and answers it.) Hello? (She listens,  turns to Lawrence) It�s for you. (She  holds out the phone.) What happened? Sweetheart, are you okay? (Diana shakes  her head no) Mommy just needs you to  be really, really, really strong right  now. I�m not gonna let anybody hurt  you. You got that? (Diana nods) Okay,  that�s my good girl. (She starts crying  as her hands work behind her to loosen  the rope around them.) (crying) Mommy help me! Larry? (looking right at Zep, firmly) You failed. Don�t move, stay on the ground. Give  me the phone. Give it to me! (He sits  up a bit, carefully slides it to her.  He is watching her, looking for an opportunity  to overcome her once again. She picks  the phone up, still keeping her eyes  and her gun at him.) Larry? No! No we�re not...(Zep starts to move  up a bit more, his right hand out, leaning  against the edge of the bed. Ally threatens  him more fiercely with the gun.) Get  down! Larry, where are you? (disbelief; she sniffles a bit) What?  What are you talking about? (desperate) Honey, we need you here.  (Zep slowly readies himself to move  forward, wide eyes still staring at  Alison.) (cries out) Mommy! Mommy, help me! (on cell phone) Larry? There�s still no answer.
