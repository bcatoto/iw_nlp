What? Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture? What is it? I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work -- No dances, just tell me. So what did you find. Evan wake up, oh please wake up! How soon?... Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off. Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple. But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have? But you must have something to go on? And the bad news? Why? What for? Anything. Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness... Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition? Just. Like. Jason. How. Did you. Know that? You're. Acting. Like your father. Fix? What does that mean for Evan? Cute, Evan. Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now. I found these. The others are still in storage. I don't know. These things take time. ...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient. And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could... I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them... When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past. Why do you ask? Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him. I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes. Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one! Something must've happened! What set him off? Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay? Honey. What were you doing with that? Great. I'll see you soon. That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss. You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him. Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there. I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I? We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him. You know the answer to that. Darn it! Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time. When did you ever care about getting to school on time?Maybe because they never do. So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates? Come on, go on... Deal. Now read me something. Wow... read something. Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books. You're kidding. He's so... big. Smells like sex in here. So what's the point?Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends. Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine. It's crossed my mind from time to time. When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again. That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother. Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about. Is something the matter? You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie. We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages. Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family. Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act. Sure you don't want your wallet? There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority. There's one major hole in your story. Know what? Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that. Oh? There's proof now? I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit? You're right, Evan, I don't believe you. On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch. Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years. Because you're... different. I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case. What's happened to you? Ha! Where's that? Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious? So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor. Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone. Evan. Stop it. It's not the time. Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him! Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket? I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but... I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same. It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know? Are you okay? My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy. It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids. Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me. It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago. Why are you doing all this for me? I don't know what to say. It's beautiful. I don't understand, where are you taking me? As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me? Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird. Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks? Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out? Those are your clothes, silly. Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed. Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better! Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath. Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood? It was a long time ago. What do you want to know, Evan? Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot. Of course. Me? Are you kidding? Why? She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever. Not if you remember my dad. No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen. They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody. I've stopped a hundred times. No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in. God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been? Hi, Lenny. Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay? He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore. I deserve a lot worse. It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny. Ouch. You really don't remember anything that happened? Oh God... what did we do? We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead. Shut up, Tommy! Oh my God oh my God... I'm sorry. Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already. You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff. Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham! Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it. Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it... Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this... I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first. Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
