Creasy... Wait. You're lying. I don't believe you. I don't believe you. Planned what? Why are you here? Why didn't you die? Jordan! The traffic takes some getting used to. Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends. It makes it all seem so serious. No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that. You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends. Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy? How are you getting along with Pinta? It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment? Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat. Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need. You've done much of this work before? You're American. The world of our children. How dare they? I'll call you from Detroit, baby. Don't forget your towel. Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby. You do? This is Mr. Creasy. We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked. Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back. Good news. You're going back to school. You should be sleeping, baby. She's young. She'll get over it. He has to go. It's not. Pinta likes him too much. She thinks of him as a father. Creasy. He has to go, Samuel. Creasy. Pinta likes him. She likes him. You realize that you've brought a killer into the house. I think it's nice he's American. Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy? Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy. Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed. Our child's safety is at stake. I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter. A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.You got that right. Dyslexic? I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number. I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you. There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained. You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim. Frank. Frankie. You think too much? My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy? I know because I go in your room and check the bottles. You don't drink like you used to. Could I ask you a question? I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free. Why today? And why'd she have to go with him? What's so important in Los Angeles? I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you. The gunshot holds no fear. Are you afraid of me? I'm not afraid you, Creasy. It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you? Where's my mother? You were never late before, I was worried. You're late. Did you used to? Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy? Good things happen, too, Creasy. Like meeting me. Yes. I don't understand. What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes? So how come you know so much about those countries? [Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?] It must be difficult having lots of wives. But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be? It was in a book at school. Concubine. Doesn't matter. I always finish second. It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle. Yes. I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends. The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you? My ankle. Everywhere! It hurts. They can stay for two weeks. I don't care. It's better to be free, right? How do you think he got out? Maybe. Did you hear him? Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him. Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late. I go to school, don't I? I'm not crying. Oh... So you were unhappy? Hmmm? But why not? Not at all? Did you like school, Creasy? We're taking a different way home. There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy? Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico? Someone gave him more money than we could. Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit. Potential? I don't understand. Why not? You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you? I know. But which state? Where are you from, Creasy? Creasy... In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy? My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon. That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left. Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside. Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German? Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy? You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead. Bye, Mom. I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick. He's like a great big bear. 'Creasy bear'... I like him, Mom. Yes, mom? Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English. When? I'm trying, mom.[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.] [Daniel Rosas Sanchez.] [Daniel.] [We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.] [Si.]Deal. I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you. How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info. He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide. He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list. Where do I find you? I have connections. So what do I get in return? So where do we begin? It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you. We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story. A lot of people are looking for you. Camila. Camila Valencias. Last night. Do you know something? Where are you? Rosanna Guerrero. [Who's that?] [And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.] [You only give information so you can fuck me.] [No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.] [And left three more dead men.] [Then what do you have to lose?] [Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.] [Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.] [He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.] [That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.] [A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.][The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."] [Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?] [No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.] [She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
