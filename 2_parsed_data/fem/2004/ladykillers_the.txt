Afternoon, Sheriff. You know the  Funthes boy? No no, WeeMack! Mackatee's eldest! Well, he's a good boy but he done  gone down to the Costco in Pascagoula  and got hisself a blastah -- and he  been playin' that music! Loud! "Left my wallet in El Segundo!" Songs like that! Hippity-hop music! You know they call it hippity-hop  music, but it don't make me wanna go  hippity-hop! And Othar don't like that music  neither! How could it help but do! That kind  of music! You know what they call  colored folks in them songs? Have  you got any idea? NIGGAZ! I don't wanna say the word.  I won't say it twice, I'll tell you  that. I say it one time. In the course a swearin' out my  complaint. NIGGAZ! Two thousand years after  Jesus! Thirty years after Martin  Luther King! The age of Montel! Sweet  lord a-mercy, izzat where we at? WeeMack down to Pascagoula buyin' a  big thumpy stereo player?! So he can  listen to that word in the house  next to mine? Sheriff, you gotta  help that boy! You gotta take an innarest! EXTEND  that helpin' hand! Well God bless ya. Don't wanna be  tried and found wantin'. Many many tunkalow parzen, Sheriff  Wyner. Many many tunkalow parzen! You have been tried and found wanting.  Don't want that writin' on the wall! Feast a Balthazar! John The Apostle said: Behold there  is a stranger in our midst, come to  destroy us! He's a good man. Just needs  instruction. Dog, you in peoples'  way. You need somethin' to eat, Angel? Mm... gizzards... Othar, I went'n complained about  WeeMack, I hope it'll do some good.  That boy hangin' by a thread! Over  the pit! Fiery pit! "I Left My Wallet  in El Segundo"! ...Sixty-seven years of life, forty- six years of marriage, you mean to  tell me you never one time suffered  from piles? It's the human condition,  most humans anyway. Like that ball  player said: world's got two kinds  of folks -- them that's got piles  and them that's gonna get 'em. But  you was always healthy as an ox... ...Passed on before you got piles.  Mmmmhmm. Thank the Lord you wasn't  sick. You don't wanna sicken 'n die.  No, you wanna pass nice 'n peaceful...  go to sleep one night, wake up in  the glory land... woof... ...Well who's that now, Pickles? PICKLES! Go get 'im! Go get Pickles, I didn't let 'im  out! Oh, he's up the tree again. Your  gonna have to shimmy on up. Huh? No, he won't come down less you  fetch him. He'd set there til Gabriel  blows his horn if someone didn't  shimmy up. Up with you now! Look, I don't want no doubletalk. If  you ain't gonna fetch him down I  guess I gotta call the po-lice... They ain't gonna be happy. Every  time they come fetch him down they  swear they won't do it no more... Don't upset him, now! Well you let him out. What, like Elmer? Fudd? Sore bone, well I guess that's  appropriate. You ever study at Bob  Jones University? It's a bible school, only the finest  in the country. I send them five  dollars every month. I'm on their mailing list. I'm an  Angel. They list my name in the newsletter,  every issue. I got the literature  here, you wanna examine it. I was wondering, til you let Pickles  out. Then in all the excitement-- Yeah, I got a room. I'm lookin' for  a quiet tenant. Fifteen dollars a  week Well you can see the room, but I  don't like double-talk. Wait a minute. You got some kind of  band? So you don't play hippity-hop, "I  Left My Wallet in El Segundo," songs  with the titles spelt all funny? Gospel music? Rococo, huh? Well, I guess that'd be  okay. Little dank, ain't it? You containing it okay. That would be a shame. One, Mountain! ...Scrub two! Scrub three! Four,  Mountain! Okay. Okay. We're prepared for that... ... Mountain, bring Otto with the  apparatus. World War I vintage gas mask. It's  authentic. Strapped on, of course,  so it can't fall off. The animal is  free to be as active as he wants,  doesn't inhibit his movement, and I  think it really sells the whole  doughboy thing-- ...Nnnnrnff! No, nothing, uh... you're absolutely  right, the gas mask is a whimsical  concept-- Well, you're absolutely right�- Of course not, that would be  inappropriate-- No no-- Easiest thing in the world. I just  thought -- but the canteen is much  better. Good concept. Let's go with  that-- Well, he's uh... Just breathe  normally, Otto. Oh, he can breathe, that thing is --  just breathe normally, Otto. Of course. Easiest thing in the world. ...It's on good and tight, I, uh...  Just breathe normally, Otto. Don't have my Leatherman. Mountain!  Give me your Leatherman! Chop chop! Good idea! Ice water, treats-� Right! Of course! No, that's me -- I -- the  Leatherman... here we go. Come on, Otto! Mountain, have electric run me a  stinger! Don't give up on me, Otto!  Mountain, I need two live leads! Clark, the gennie's a hundred yards  away! Goddamnit! Otto's gonna have brain  damage in about ninety seconds! Okay! ...Kiss of life! Yao gin nyap! Hi-Ho. You preach a wonderful sermon, Brother  Cleothus. That man has a lot to say. Yes he does. And every word of it the truth. Mm-mm. Jesus well pleased with him. Deed he is. Pleased as he can be. Mm-mm. Stout, too. Mm-mm. It was a good sermon. That man has a  lot to say. ...Stout, too. It would've been a  comfort to you... And the choir was all in good voice.  Mm-mm- ...Who could that-- Somebody die? No smoking in this house. You ain't gonna make a racket, are  ya? Hmph. Happy to be on board. That's okay, don't stop on account  of me. Huh. I just thought you might like  to see-what a you gotten up to, honey?  Why you sweatin' like that. You mind! I don't want that kind of  talk in my home, even in the root  cellar. This is a Christian house,  boy, none of that hippity-hop  language. Sometimes it's the only way! ...I'm tryin' to help you, son! ...Better yaself! Don't make no never-mind he's  transported! You been smokin'? My youth I was in church, I wasn't  walkin' around fiery. Youth ain't no  excuse for nothin'! Well, anyway...  only came down to show you the fife. ...Othar's fife. He burned his own. Mm-hm. I thought maybe bein' a musical  man you'd be interested. Cut it himself and burned the holes.  Israelites called it a kalil. Kalil, fife, same thing. You can  read about it in the Bible. Ain't  nothin' new under the sun. Gone these twenty years. He was some  kind of man. ...Blowed the kalil. I don't know nothin' 'bout that.  Othar didn't study no shofar, to the  extent a my knowledge. The kalil was  good enough for my Othar... ...Some kind of man. He can't do that. You could sue him.  Open and shut case. This is not 1952. I'm afraid there's a setback on the  tunneling front too. We've run into  a pretty large rock, and-- Oh, we can get through the rock, no  worries there. Simplest thing in the  world. Why we blow right through it;  I've got a pyro license, we bore a  hole in the rock, pack in a little  plastique; igneous blows pretty good,  and we-- ...Who? Hello Clark. Am I ordering the prima  cord? Yes, Mountain, we were just talking  about that, and some plastique. This is Mountain Girl. Mountain is  my right hand. She helps me with  ordnance. Helps me with damn near  everything. Of course. I understand that. But  this is Mountain... ...I don't keep secrets from Mountain.  That's not how you maintain a loving,  caring relationship. Look, you, I'll thank you to stop  referring to Mountain that way. She's  the other half of my life. You son of a bitch punk! Shut your  goddamn mouth! ...Nobody talks to Mountain Girl  that way. She had an abusive family! Little punk. I got syrup on my safari  jacket. Mountain Girl. Of course. Wouldn't have it any other  way. Up yours, punk. ...You just a readin' fool, ain't  you Mr. Dorr. Mm-mm. Wisdom of mankind, what about the  wisdom of the Lord? I know who he is. Kinda creepy. Who was Helen? She wasn't a loose  woman, was she? Some kinda whore a  Babylon? Oh Mr. Dorr, why you are such a  gallant man... Othar loved that music... Yes, I got  a widow-lady friend... Huh? Excuse me. Sheriff Wyner, how you doin'... Mm-hm. Hang on there, Sheriff, somebody I  want you to meet. Why, you chasin' a gang of bank  robbers? Get on in here say hello. ...We was just havin' tea, talkin'  about Othar-- ...Hm... Bussed his own dishes. You  can always tell a gentleman. Mm-hm, with me'n Othar. Come on up to his room. Mm, he's neat. Probably went down to the cellar to  play with his friends. What the... ...What the... Why, Professor! ...What you doin' havin' tea down  there?! ...Land of Goshen! Get out from under  there! Why of all the... Why I never! The drill bit's getting awfully hot.  Gawain, maybe you could fill a hudson  sprayer and spritz it down while I  drill. Look, are you gonna have a bug up  your ass for the rest of the time we  work together? No no, me and this gentleman here  have to get square. Let me tell you  something, MacSam. You wanna know  something? I'm gonna tell you how I came down  to Mississippi. Wasn't born here,  you know. I'm from Scranton,  Pennsylvania... ...Nnnff! ...Scranton, Pennsylvania. Came down  here in 1964. Greyhound Bus. With  the Freedom Riders. You know who the  Freedom Riders were, MacSam? The Freedom Riders, my fine young  man, were a group of concerned  liberals from up North -- whites,  Negros, and yes, Jewish people --  all working together, just like we  are here. Concerned citizens who  came down here so that local black  people could have their civil  liberties. So that people like you  could have the vote. What, brother? Why you fucking-- That's it! ...Let's step outside, MacSam! My friend Mrs. Funthes is here so  I'm about to go on out. I just wanted  to leave y'all with some cinnamon  cookies... ...Y'all sound pretty good. It'd be  nice if you'd come by the church  some day, give us a recital. Oh, I see all right, but we don't  make a big whoop-dee-do about  denominations; everybody welcome at  our church. We've had Methodists  come in. Episcopals. Even had a Jew  come in once with a guitar back in  the sixties. Professor, this is Rosalie Funthes,  Rosalie, Professor G.H. Dorr, Ph.D. Oh my, that's an awful lot of letters. All right, safety meeting, let's  listen up. General, could you hand  me the prima cord and the compound  there. Before we set the charge we'll  run through our procedure. ...I have earplugs for whoever wants  them. Just wedge them in your ears.  Now here we have -- not yet, Lump. ...Now. Prima cord. Gelatinite. C4.  Time comes, we pack the hole in the  rock with the C4 and insert two leads. ...and B. ...Charge comes from a battery that  is inside this plunger. Ordinary  auto battery, you can pick it up at  Sears, easiest thing in the world... Mm-mm. He a man of learnin'? This is the same procedure we will  be using when we collapse the tunnel  after entering the casino vault and  returning to the root cellar. ...This is for your own protection,  so pay close attention. Once these  materials are combined only the  professionals may handle them. That  means me, or the General. Separately  they are harmless-completely inert.  Why, you could light this stuff on  fire, hit it with a hammer-- ...What in the name of heaven was  that? Didn't hear anything?! ...why, it's nothing to make a fuss  about. Perfectly all right... happens  all the time... ...No, no. Really, I'm perfectly all  right. Sure, but-- Of course. Simplest thing in the  world. Microsurgery-- Oh yes, they have remarkable abilities  in the, uh... They using the house to practice  music a the rococo. Mmmm-hm. I don't know what all the fuss is  about. PICKLES! ...You catch Pickles now! You let the cat out! Of course. Why, it's child's play  now, easiest thing in the world.  Only a couple of feet separate us  from the vault... ...Just the usual spadework until we  hit the masonry of the vault, and  then we drill through. Oh, I should think so, it's only one  finger. Inhibits me in doing finer  work, of course. I'll always have to  live with that... Ahem. Maybe, and  I'm just thinking out loud here,  maybe since, as you say, it will  present problems later... Well, maybe -- and this is something  I've talked over with Mountain Girl,  and she agrees with me, so it's not  just one person's opinion -- maybe I  should get a little extra compensation  for the accident. ...Somewhat larger share. Why, if  this were any other line of work I'd  be getting workmen's comp, wouldn't  I? Might even have a pretty good  lawsuit. Well that is simply asinine-- But if it were-- Look, you-- Well, okay, majority rules, like I  say, it was just a trial balloon.  Hand's not so bad really, I even get  some phantom feeling. It will be twelve-fifteen? Hnnnn. Arrunggggh! Rnffff. ...Mmmmnggh! ...IBS! IBS! Irritable Bowel Syndrome! Is  there a men's room down here?! Or a lady's room! IBS! Quickly! No choice! Quickly! It's a medical  condition! Feel thirty pounds lighter. ...Thank you for being so  understanding. Not everyone is, of  course, which is why the biggest  challenge of IBS is educating the  public. Afflicts over two million  people yet most of us have never  heard of it. And it strikes without  regard to age, gender or race. That's the kind of attitude we're  fighting. ...I guess I never told you, that's  how Mountain Girl and I met. They  had an IBS Weekend at Grossinger's,  in the Catskills. Of course the  tourist business up there has  suffered, with the demise of the  Borscht Belt. So they have different  promotions, mixers, so on. This was  a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles  to meet and support each other and  share stories. Well, some of them are very-- Huh. Looks like an Ikegami. ...Oh yeah. Mm-hm. I'm not sure  whether it's broadcasting... ...Um-hm... No... ...Hard wire... Look, I didn't choose to have IBS-- There's no cure, you know. Only  control. Lifelong condition. Not  complaining, just fact. And I did  meet Mountain. Charge should've gone off already. The charge to collapse the tunnel. I  set it for eight minutes. Of course. I understand. She certainly does. Huh. Nnnnrungh... ...Huh? ...What the-- Perfectly all right. Not a problem. Professor, I'm surprised. I hadda fix tea. I wanna talk to  you, Professor, don't you be leavin'.  And don't make any more noise! And  you! ...I told you, I don't want any  smokin' in here! You get back down those stairs! Hush! Down those stairs! We havin'  tea now! I be down shortly. ...He's the tenant. I don't know what you boys been up  to but I wasn't born yesterday and I  know mischief when I see it. Now I  want an explanation, but first I  want you boys to get your fannies up  here with y'alls period instruments.  I been tellin' the ladies about your  music and they wanna hear you play. ...Hmph. Hmph. That was soooome poem. ...You know any? Now, I wanna know what's goin' on. Hmph. ...What about all that money? That's right. Don't trust the banks. Never have. This don't smell right. I'm callin'  Sheriff Wyner. Mm-hm. Lord have mercy! Stolen money! ...Just one penny? Well that's prob'ly true... Well... it's hard to see the harm in  it... One penny... ...I'm sorry, Professor. No. It's wrong. Don't you be leadin'  me into temptation. No, it's just plain wrong. Stealin'.  I know your intentions were good,  and I won't call the police if you  give the money back. But I gotta see  that you do it. And all a you gotta go to church  with me next Sunday. I made up my mind. You can double- talk all you want, but its church or  the county jail. You think it over. I gotta feed the  cat. Sure, easiest thing in the world. I  could whip up a little mortar in one  of those snow saucers, lay the bricks,  anchor in some chains, Mountain has  a source for the manacles... Well, sure, fair enough. ...I'm thinking, though, that since  I lost my finger -- I mean, literally  lost it because of that goddamn cat --  maybe I should be excused from this  thing. Hard for me to squeeze a  trigger anyway-- Listen, punk-- Well, okay... it was just a trial  balloon... Long straw. You all see it. All your  fuss over nothing, punk. What you got there, Gawain? Nothin' my ass! You got a dog there! A filthy noisy little pest of a puppy  dog gonna shit all over the house! I'm gonna train you real good! I  told you don't bring no stray dogs  into this house! ...You wait til your Daddy gets home,  he gonna lay into you proper! Daddy gonna kick your ass! ...Bringin' in a filthy dirty dog! Mama's whuppin' Gawain's ass! What you doin'? What you doin' with  my pillow there? I'm displeased with you! Colored boy  like you, falling in with that trash  downstairs! ...Ashamed a yourself! Didn't your  mama raise you right! Wait a minute. You've got to accept  your responsibilities, young man. Now look here, it's the easiest thing  in the world. Pretend her head is a  casaba melon, and the gun is a melon- baller, and-- Look, with equal rights come equal  responsibilities-- Why you sniveling little coward! You think you scare me, you mewling  punk! You don't scare me! Bull Connor  and all his dogs didn't scare me! ...Be a man! Be a man! WHY YOU BASTARD PUNK! MOUNTAIN GIRL ...SHE COULD RIDE YOUR ASS TO JELLY! ...Oh my god... ...I think he's hit! ...I'll just check the carotid artery. ...That's a negative. Sure he's dead. I checked his carotid  artery. Mm-hmm. I don't care they was receptive or  not! Well that is a shame. Well I'm glad y'all came to see the  light, anyway. I'm gonna have some  tea and go to bed. They back yet? Good. I'll go dump these in the  hearse. No extra share, huh... ...Nnnrnf. ...Oof! Mountain. Clark. ...Nnrungh! Aaarmh... Ninnnff...  Offffflleghhll... IBS, dear? Nnnnnmmmmfffgh! Hmm. Mm-hm. Professor! ...Hmm. Couldn't face the music. Scoot now! Outa the way! Sheriff, I gotta make a statement. I guess it can wait, but it's about  that casino money. Something? Everything! I got it at  home. The money. Two point six million  dollars. Down in my root cellar. All  stacked up nice and neat. Bunch a desperate men that stole it  put it there, that's how! They was  musicians of the Renaissance period,  played the sackbutt and so on --  well, it turns out they really  couldn't play, although they could  recite poems to break your heart.  Their ringleader speaks in dead  tongues. I tried to get you to see him! That  night? I had to yell at 'em 'bout stealin'  all that money and I guess I made  'em feel pretty bad 'cause they picked  up and left without takin' the money.  But I was peeved with 'em, Sheriff,  they'd been up to all sorts of  mischief, come close to blowin' up  the house, disturbed Othar no end. Wouldn't you be? All that racket! And they let Pickles out too! No, he's back, but what you want me  to do with the money? Keep it? Well... I know it's only a penny  offa everybody's policy... I know folks don't much care. Could  I... You s'pose I could... Could I give it all to Bob Jones  University? ...Well, long as everybody knows. You're welcome, sheriff. Just doin'  my duty. Leaning, Leaning, Safe and secure  from all harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean  on Jesus, Leaning on the everlasting  arm. ...What a fellowship, What a peace  of mind, Safe and secure from all  harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean on Jesus,  Leaning on the everlasting arm... ...Pickles! ...Pickles!
