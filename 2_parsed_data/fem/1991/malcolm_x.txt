After I hit the number that woman wasn't no good  to me at all.  Will you let me tell it?  Red's in the head, man.  Hey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you.   Man, don't scare him more than he's scared  already. Ain't too bad...   Git his forehead and eyebrows.  Hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.  'Lo. I've got to freshen up.  Why don't you take your little girl home, Red,  and come on back?  I ain't stupid.  I know where you're going.  What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.   Malcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen white  breasts like these?  ...That isn't a whore?  That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's  not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't  run.  Who wants to talk?   What you mean took his own life?!  Do you pay or don't you?  You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?  Sweetie, they're almost ready.  You the man.   You evil this morning.   Me?  Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.   Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got  class and you're smart.  I do know I love you.  Oh, Malcolm, I love you. Please, there's no one  around. Now?  Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say  you're running around town with her.  She raised me, my mother died when I was six.  Is your mother alive?  I did knock.  Did you hear me say come in?  There's no point in fighting about it. I'm  sorry. May I sit down?  As you nice enough to ask, we'll git you one.   It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the  death of your husband--  Murder.  -- there is a serious question as to whether --  I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the  only kindness.  Get out.  Your control over your children, therefore--  Did you hear me?!  You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.  If you don't move out through that door, you're  going to be past all regretting.  This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep  it clean.  This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him  like a brother.  He's bright.  It's not the end of the world, Malcolm.  I said it just as plain, I said, don't let them  feed that boy no pig, because he got enough of  the devil in him already. I told her she ain't  got no reason talk to me that way cuz' my hair  blow in the wind. You want my skin. All right,  I'll give it to you. I'll scrape it off. See  how you like it.  I saw it in my dream. 5, 5, 5. And last week my  sister had a dream and she hit.  Baby, I was gonna give it to you.  August 2nd. I think. Yeah.  I thought you said we were going to the movies  last night.  And like a fool I believe it.  Daniel come in yet, Honey?  Ain't that him now?  You know that gal?  'Bout every other night, Red.  If she got eyes, she do.  Not yet. But the way things going, that boy  gonna turn her out any day.  You had the number.  Earl, I know you a better shot than that. You  shoulda killed 'em all, shot 'em dead.  We'll take it easy. I got a place fixed up on  Harvard Square. How's that sound?  You want eggs, baby?  How about Rudy?  Don't.  Red, for God's sake--   I can't stand it.   Beacon Hill survey.  We're doing a survey for the Athenaeum Society  -- We wondered if you'd permit us to include  your collection in the catalog of Great New  England Antiques--?  Now these are my prizes. My Paul Revere silver  coffee service.  Lovely, just lovely.  And my husband's collection of scrimshaw should  be included.  May we see it?  Won't you step this way?  He ought to try to make it a little easier,  Brother Bembry.  The Sister wonders if the Brother knows what  Harriet Tubman did between taking souls to the  Promised Land?  She ate.  If you want to tell me.  Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose  marriage?  I think you've made your points, Brother  Malcolm.  That you haven't time for either marriage or  eating--  If you'll start eating, there is a question I  have. Go ahead. Start.  Yes, I understand, Brother Malcolm. Purely  scientific.  I see your point.  Could we sit down someplace?  You've been on your feet for days. And didn't  even finish your salad.  What?  How do you like it?  There's nothing to talk about.  Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.   You have enough worries of your own.  Why do you ask?  If it's just idle, I won't answer it.  There's a few things you don't know about  women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and  vain.  And dogged when I set my mind to something.  Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good  wife.  It's Sidney.  The Honorable Elijah Muhammad would like to see  you now.  Hello.  Yes.  I know.  Yes.  Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?  Yes. Did you eat?  Just hold me.  Hush your mouth.  You're with me even when you're away.  The simplest thing in the world: I want to have  a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love  you.  Attallah is fine. Our firstborn is an angel and  a beauty. And misses you as I do. But the news  that you've dedicated four new temples is  almost as good as having you with us.  Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so  he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good  law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you  a question?  Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black  supremacy? Why do you teach hate?  You put it very well.  Entirely.  Let him finish.  Because you're in trouble.  Dear heart, because I know you.  I'm not made of glass.  We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But  we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.  The talk is everywhere!  We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just  talk any more.  "Both women, in their 20's, charged they had  had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since   To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?  No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are  you so dedicated that you have blinded  yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face  the truth? Bembry is the editor of the  newspaper you established. Ask him why your  name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a  year? Ask him why you rate front page in every  paper in the country, but not a single sentence  in your own.  Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so  blind, everyone can see this but you!!!  A long time ago. You've repaid them many times  over. Ask them why they have new cars and  houses full of new furniture.  What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down jalopy  and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own  our own home. What about our children? What  about me? You don't even own life insurance.  Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are  you blind?  We need you too!  Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a  day; but the possibility of betrayal never  enters your mind. If you won't do that for  yourself do it for us.  Her name is Eva Marie, she's 2 years old.  Brother Minister, I did nothing wrong. I did  nothing to be put in isolation. I believed in  him. I believed in the Honorable Elijah  Muhammad.  This is Saudi, she's 3 and you have Lisha,  she's 2. Brother Minister the Honorable Elijah  Muhammad is the father of my 3 children.  Yes sir.  Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is  support for my children. He should provide for  his children. That's all I want.  C'mon girls, it's bedtime.  I arrived in Jedda, Saudi Arabia. I have never  witnessed such sincere...  Get some sleep.  Shhh!  Dear heart, I love you.  Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone.  I'll kill you. I'll kill you.  Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us.  I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?  Dear heart, where are you?  I just put them to bed. Can we come to the  meeting tomorrow?  Say thank you.  Thank you.  Son, you all right?  Good. We need you. I recognize you, don't pay  them folks no never mind, you keep on doing  what you doing.  I'll pray for you too, son. Jesus will protect  you.  I apologize Brother Minister, we'll have it  next week.  Brother Minister, I understand.  Somebody call an ambulance. Somebody call an  ambulance.  They killed him. They killed him.   I'm Malcolm X.  I'm Malcolm X.
