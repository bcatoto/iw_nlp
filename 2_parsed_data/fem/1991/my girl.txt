Thank you. Bye. Will you tell her I came by? Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J. Hi, is Vada home?You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you. Why do you think she says that? Do you think she is? Oh yes, yes. So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.Ex...ex, ex... This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss... God I guess i'll have to introduce you now. The boss is watching us... Keep your voice down! I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine. Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here? I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter. Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot; Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead. Perfect. I would never marry anybody I didn't love. Pointing upwards Look... Can we see it from the back yard? Well, you were pretty great! Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say! Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise..... Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God. How's it going chef? You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time. It's for Shelly's famous potato salad. Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along? Goodnight. Goodnight. It's only eight o'clock. Good. Kiss me. Do you want to? What are you wearing? See, you're not that out of touch. You're good. In ages, I know, me neither. This is where we are. Dance with me? Did she ever see Vada? What happened to her? I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and... Are you mad at me? You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush. I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces. Home sweet home. Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute. I had a good time tonight. You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want. Kinda like men. Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry. I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon. I just had a terrible thought Harry. Does it make it easier to win? Okay. I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in. I'll let you get back to work. You have to learn how to take a complement. Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it? In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest. Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu. No kidding? Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society. Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing. Hi. I'm sure she will. I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much. Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up. Harry, I really think she..... I don't think so, I think she's confused about death. Well the other night at dinner... Harry? I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada. I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image. I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972. You don't like it? Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter? I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks. Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal. Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common. I need the job. Excuse me, what about the job? The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot; Stiffs?? They're dead? I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease. I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving. It's still available I hope? Bye. Sure. Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days. Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone. Hi. Goodnight. Okay, get in to bed. I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing. It's okay sweetheart. Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently. It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada. It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk. How old are you? What do you mean you're hemorrhaging? Well he just left, what's wrong? Vada, Vada, what's the matter? Yes!! Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish? Oh great!! Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine. I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis. This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit. We used to be married. Uh huh, why? Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada. Aarrggh. Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet. All right, open your eyes. They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow. Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth. Come here, sit down. Have you ever tried any? A girl's always gotta look her best. No. Okay. Sure. Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back? Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other. No, I'm divorced. Mostly love, and romance. Uh huh. Thomas? Ohh, right. Would you like a soda? Sure. I'll give you the royal tour. Hi. Come on sweetie. Vada? VADA?? What happened?? Well you don't know that. Ask him. I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad? Maybe black means you're happy? Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing. Chocolate? You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you. Who's winning? Oh. Yes it is. Oh great! Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day. Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place. They're just fun to read. Liverpool? Uh huh. To chocolate? Thomas J?Wanna play? Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way. I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday. Arthur!! Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy. You're such a baby. Hey, you didn't pay me! Leave him alone! Come on, let's go. The bee stings! I can't breathe! It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop. I can't breathe, I'm suffocating. Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty?? It's there. Can't you see it? Yes. That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms. I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J. Do you miss her? Really? What was my mama like? In the garage. I found this. The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother. Did I kill my mother? Get away, get away!! He's okay isn't he? Why not? Maybe I should go over and yell at him. I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung? Yes. Feeding my fish. Hi. I'll ride on the bumper cars with you! Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish. I like the freak show. Yes.. When?? When? Are they ready yet? Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad? Sorry. Can I go too? Why? You never cared before. Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo? The money? Dad?? Dad? Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer. It's for school, for summer writing class. Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars? Then who's it for? Is it for a child? Daddy, how come that coffin's so small? Dad? Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em! Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday. Ahem. I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction. Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing. Cancer. I'm dying. Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart. I can't stay, I just came to read my poem. Get away from me! No.... Who's that? No he wouldn't, I can't go home. I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here. Mr. Bixler, I love you. Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel. Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode. I wrote a poem too. Uh huh, I wanna be a writer. I paid the money. No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace. What do you get for that? How much does it cost? How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working? This is one big house for one single person. Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house? Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun. It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading. My Dad was funny? Really? Why? Do you like her? Does he love her? He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life. Goodnight. I will I promise. I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again. I think it should be outlawed. My Mommy and Daddy did THAT? I'm eleven and a half. I don't want, I don't need your help.... I'm hemorrhaging. Where's Daddy? Daddy??!?!?! NO! NO!, He's fine. Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish. I won, I won!!! Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs. Are you here to take Shelly back? I like my name. See food! Hey Shelly, like seafood? Hi. Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me. Do you like putting makeup on people? The boys at school don't think I am. Shelly, do you think I'm pretty? No. I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color. So how come you're putting lipstick on? Are you going out somewhere? You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late. Can I use your bathroom first? Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced. Are you married? What are they about? Did you read ALL these books? I would. Big Ringo fan. Can we look around in your camper? My ball, I lost my ball. He won't give it to me. Shut your big fat mouth! I don't think so. Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars? It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in. He's allergic to everything. I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating. I am. She's shy. That's really cool. Is that your camper? For what? What? Seeya tomorrow. Well, let's spit on it. Just, hurry. Say something it's too quiet. Okay on the count of three. Just do it. Close your eyes. Uh huh. Okay, enough practice. Here, practice on your arm like this. Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal. Uh huh. Have you ever kissed anyone? Not true. It is not. I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler. I dunno.. Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys. No, I'm hiding out. Leave then, some friend you are. Then go home, baby. He likes her better than me. I don't like her. You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring. My Dad gave Shelly a ring. Get up!? No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family. California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch. Bye Mrs. Sennett. Hi, wanna ride bikes? Do it! Jump in the water!! I am running faster!! My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it! What do you want it for anyway? Are you crazy, you'll get stung!! So? What? HEY YOU!!!! I'm gonna get you!!! I'll get you!!!! What? Go??? Duck! We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch. Bed wetter! Pacifist! Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight. Sorry. Here. It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud. I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last. What? No. Grammoo said she's in heaven. It's my mother. Yes. Never mind. You have no personality. Hmmmm, interesting. Come on, it's fun. That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head. Oh, in the garage. Walk me over. A girl can never wear enough eye shadow. No. Uh huh. It'll bleed. You could pick that scab on your arm. Hey, we can become blood brothers. Reel it in. He's only tiny, throw him back. Hurry! Big deal, I can do that too. Thomas J, you got something! Maybe they had a big breakfast. It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer. It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood. Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat. No, I'm going home. Hi Mr. Bixler! That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him. Oh wow, a real evil canieval. I knew he wouldn't come.
