M'Lord Arthur!  Where is my brother? Did he not ride with you? Foul thing!  A pox on your throat! Thou art a Murderer!  A black Murderer! May you be consoled by their suffering in the pit. Aye. Into the pit with the bloodthirsty sons of whores! I pray thee to forgive me.  I believed thee one of Henry's men. I'm sorry m'lord. Please understand... T'is a cruel time for us. The Wisemen say you are the promised one. Our only hope against the darkness that has descended on this land. I think not.  I feel that there is reason for your being here. It is no accident. YOU SHALL DIE! YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE The Evil lives.  Slay me and ten will rise to take my place.  All will die.  ALL WILL - ---DIE! I still believe that thou wilt help us. I still have faith in thee. In my heart I know thou wilt still succeed. M'Lord Ash!  Help me! Don't touch me!  You foul thing! The Promised one will come for you.
