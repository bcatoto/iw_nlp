Could it be so? Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez? I know. (amused) Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving... I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here! (still kissing him) I find that hard to believe. Rise...!  Come forward! I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool. The ocean is uncrossable? (a beat) That she was impregnable. I cannot ignore the verdict of my council. How little you know. (with a smile) You show no inclination to speak otherwise! (amused at his familiarity) A woman? Then we are equal... since you are the only sailor I know! How old are you, Senor Colon? Thirty eight... You will be informed of our decision. You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted. (with a smile) Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it? (turning to Sanchez) Call him back! (moved) Thank God... (softly) I'm not asking you to swear to anything. (smiling) That's something you can't decide. Speak to Diego. Do they have such thoughts? We are more than gratified. (with a smile) You don't usually ask. For once I wish you weren't right. Will he survive? We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time. Is this true, Brother Buyl? Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez? And who would you think of, for such a task? Is he? Really? Rise... Please... We have decided to allow you to undertake another voyage to the new world... But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent. There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this? I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence. Because he is not afraid of me. They tried... but I didn't let them. They took everything... I am busy inside. What is it, now?  Tell me...
