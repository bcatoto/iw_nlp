It's just a dream, Jimmy, just a  dream It's just a dream Jimmy, just a dream Oh God, Oh God. Not the President  for Christ's sake. Oh God -- WHO'S Wow! Hi... You have a problem with doors? Wow! You followed me? Why? Wow... neat... ...maybe you should meet my old man? Pam... That's Jim. My new friend. No it wasn't. It was worse! No what? What! You're crazy! Okay... just talk though. No funny  stuff. I've been real upset. I lost my car  on the freeway yesterday. I left it  somewhere and I can't remember where  and when I went back it was gone. My  sister... I really don't want to know These are like beautiful! I never  read much poetry in school. I hated  it. What's a "shaman"? Are you a "shaman"? I don't know. Experience. Freedom.  Love... Now. Peyote's like love.  When it's given it's blessed. When  it's sold it's damned. I like peyote.  I like acid, it's easier to get. I  like the spiritual voyage. The first  time I did acid I saw God. I did. I  had a friend who was Christ. And he  was Judas too. I suddenly knew the  secret of everything -- that we're  all one, the universe is one. And  that everything is beautiful. I think you're alive by recognizing  beauty -- seeing truth because when  you discover truth you discover what  love is... we're all saying the same  thing. It's "love me and I'll love  you." Do you love Death? Why do I look at you... and see my  death? No, that's ridiculous. How did you know! What was your father? I bet you moved around a lot. How many sisters and brothers? One... she's the pretty one... I  love your neck. That's beautiful. Who did you write  it for? ...take your time, Jim... there's no  hurry, I'm all you have to do  tonight... I think it's hot!! Is that horny motherfucker in the  black pants here tonight? Oh please. I forgot my I.D.. I'm on  the list. So Jerry... do we get paid for this? ...make sure you get Barb and Sue  Anne to come. And tell them to ask  for Jim! I want to! I want to! I'm ready.  Let's go to the desert... do the  peyote, the good peyote. "Love". They're the best... better'n the  Beatles. And who are you? The Doors. I heard of you. That's  the dumbest name. I wouldn't go to  the Fog if you paid me. Let's go Jim, come on. I don't have a phone number. So give  me your number then. Well, would you leave my name at the  door? Caprice. I don't know what I am. I'm on the  cusp of Sagittarius and Capricorn.  Sagittarius is wild and Capricorn  domestic and safe, so I don't know  which one to be. Oh my God, the light, it's so  beautiful Ray. Can you see it...  it's all one... honey? Jim! Jim... come here, dance... don't  go away. As compared to what? I don't want to die ever, what a  weird thing to say. Oh Jimmmmm, pleeeaaase look, I looove  youuuuu, Jimmmmmm, pleeeeeaase,  Jimmmmm, here, sign miiiine... take  a picture Jim?... Jim, Jim, oh please  look at me Jim!! Don't wash it. Don't set it. He likes  it the way it is... What can I do, what do you want me  to do?... Jim? It happens to other guys too... It's not so complicated Jim, it's  just sex, y'know. It's the hours man, the pressure,  everything's like your last  performance, you're setting yourself  up. Aren't you doing this for you, because  you're a poet, not a rock star. Ed  Sullivan's not a place for you. What are you saying! Why are you doing this to me? And this is gonna help! It's probably  the cause. 'Least put some soul in  your success asshole! Right. Give it to me!!! Fuck you man I'm outta here. ...how many dogs have you fucked!  You don't say No to anybody! Drugs,  dogs, uglies, you'd fuck a doorknob  with butter on it! You're the first one who couldn't  make it with me anyway! You're the  only limp dick in the lot!!! NO! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME!! WHAT ABOUT ME! WHAT ABOUT ME! LIAR LIAR LIAR. YOU PROMISED. YOU Yes yes yes. ...with me. Yes... yes... ...yes, yes, yes. ...yes... You want to do some more cocaine?  It'll loosen you up. 14th Century. I practice the Craft. I'm a witch A white one. The Kennealy's were Celtic cheiftains  and pre-Christian shamans when your  Druid ancestors the Morrisons were a  minor Scottish clan founded by a  bastard son of the king of Norway. It's a religion, witchcraft. Witches  are the protectors of the seasons,  the harvests, goddesses of the grain.  And when crossed, destroyers. You ever try drinking blood? It works you know. You drink blood  the right time of the moon... they  used to dance in the forests naked.  I think that's what offended the  Puritans and led to the Burnings.  They were a sexual threat to their  male order like the Bacchae -- five  days a year for Dionysus, they used  to wander the hills in ancient Greece,  the first witches, clans of wild  women fucking, looting, eating animals  raw, the wine in their blood running  hot -- looking for Dionysus... to  tear him to pieces -- isn't that  wild? Blood is the rose of mysterious union,  symbol of potency... now you. Don't be such a child! If I do it,  you have to do it. Come on rock god, fuck me, fuck me  good. Come on... Cut me! Cut me go on! Yeah YEAH! FUCK ME! FUCK ME!! GO ON FUCK ME!!! Take off your shirt. You remind me of a Russian peasant.  I see you standing in a wheat field.  The pride, the arrogance. You love  to look at yourself don't you. You  love yourself. ...good... big cat stalking... ...the camera is like a roulette  wheel Jim. It becomes whoever you  want it to be -- a woman you want to  seduce, a man you want to kill, a  mother you want to upset, a wife you  want to lie to or love, whatever you  want it to be, it is... Forget the Doors. It's you they want,  Jim. You're the Doors. You control the audience, like dogs,  manipulate them Jim, one picture can  control a million people, be anything  you want -- growl at them, be ugly,  be frightened, be selfish. Be man,  woman, whild, animal. Live, die,  return again. Anything you want.  Everything is permitted. Go on look at yourself, fall in love  with yourself. You're your own  audience now Jim. They want you.  Worship and love and adore you... ...Jim Morrison, the god of Rock and  Cock... Exactly... Oh Jim this is Tom... Baker, he's an  actor, he was in Andy's movie and  this is Count Ruspoli. He lives in  Paris, but he's Italian. He's from a  very famous family over there. They're  seven hundred years old. Don't you like the way he talks.  Isn't he cool? Like? I loved them! "Mad bad and  dangerous to know." That's what they  said about him. Your poems should be  taken as seriously. Y'know I don't even like rockers.  They're sleazy. I made up my fuck  list the other night -- out of 30  guys there were maybe three of them,  y'know. I'm not a groupie. You like that hunh? Beg! You wanna fuck me, Morrison, don't  ever lie to me again. Ever! Your father. Why do you tell me  bullshit like your father's dead? If he's so dead, then who answered  the phone when I called the house? You didn't really think you'd get  away with that, Morrison. An Admiral  in the United States Navy. Who's at  the Gulf of Tonkin when Vietnam  starts. Your Dad's a Deputy Chief of  Operations. Well naturally he wasn't too happy  when I called. Your Mom wanted to  talk but he shut her off. What, I'm a "fuckin' cunt" because I  called the house? Like it's hard to  trace your school records. University  of Florida, Albuquerque, New Mexico,  Arlington, Virginia, Washington,  D.C. Brother, sister, it's seven  miles long baby -- it's all in the  "The End", it's so easy. Don't ever try to hide anything from  me again. Okay? Go on... tell me.  Did he make you cut your hair? Did  he hit you, was he a bully? Did he  love you? How much? And your mother? It doesn't matter anymore does it.  Listen to them. It's you they want  now. Not the Doors, not your mother  or your father's child... They want  you Jim. You have no choice, Jim. I see you  up there like Icarus. I see you flying  closer and closer to the sun. And  your wings are melting... You idiot, don't you know who... Help! They got Jim!!! What do you know what Jim needs? Fuck you Morrison. You're outta here  you fuckhead, get out! Jim, I need some safflower oil. Do  you think you can find me a bottle? And get some Gravy Train for Sage. I'll meet you up front. Jim you got any cash? It's only another $95,000 but I could  get the best clothes. From India,  Morocco Jim, clothes you can't find  anywhere, we could get the richest  people to come, Miles Davis, Cher,  the Stones, it's gonna be the best  boutique on La Cienega Jim... why  are we walking, how come we don't  have a car? ...that was months ago. We got another  car. The red one with the black interior.  Remember it was a shift and I didn't  like it. What happened to it? Oh Jim! Damn! Where's the Gravy Train?  Whatsamatter? What are you on? You  promised you wouldn't drink today. You're not gonna drink any more are  you Jim. And you're gonna change those stinky  leathers you been wearing for three  weeks. What the hell are you on? Jesus Jim! Goddamit! You PROMISED. I  made the duck! People are coming!  Ray and Dorothy think we're flaky  enough and I... you said you'd wait  till after, you're going to peak  before me. Yeah sure. What are you saying? You wanna marry  me Jim? I like it when you sing to me What am I going to do about these  papers! Jim, Jim -- you really need  someone to organize this stuff. Your  handwriting's just like a little  kid. My God look at this. I wonder if  William Blake was ever this  disorganized. Oh the duck! I'm gonna be your editor now,  seriously I'm going to organize all  your stuff. I'm gonna take out all  the fuck words. I'm not -- I'm not. There's some great poetry here Jim,  some wonderful ideas. But what am I supposed to do? How do  I fit in? Who am I supposed to be  around all these people? I'm not your girl, don't give me  that shit. I know you fuck everything  that touches you. Hi Jim... Come on Pam, let's put out the  plates... Anne O'Riordan. Are you Anne  O'Riordan? You must be Pamela You actually put your dick in this  woman Jim? I understand... I really do but don't  ever think that Jim's gonna love you  or take care of you. You're one of a  hundred you know Look who's talking I'd like to think Jim can make up  his own mind who he loves and who he  doesn't. Don't kid yourself sweetheart, Jim's  crazy but he's not that crazy. He  loves me. Yes, let's go into the kitchen. The  duck's ready. Jim, you should meet Chuck Vincent.

What do you need? What are you drinking? I'm going to have to call the captain  if you can't control these people. I  guarantee that. I saw it!... Yes, yes! Jim! Jim! Where? I didn't see it. I can't fucking believe you just  said that! It'd be a fucking genius, that's  what it'd be! You and me. The child  would be a god, goddess! You're a COWARD!! A LITTLE BOY!!

FUCK YOU. I'm gonna have the kid. No you won't. Bullshit Morrison You know who you are... NO. What difference does it make.  You know, you never pretended. I  did. I don't even like kids  particularly, but I don't want the other thing  either. I guess what I really want  is to throw myself off this fucking  balcony Well now that you've fucked the  future, Morrison, have you fucked  everything?... Have you looked at yourself in the  mirror. Your stomach... Fuck me one last time, you worthless  piece of shit. The question that will be answered  today: Did Jim Morrison or did he  not take off his pants last March?  This is... I booked you round trip to New York  for Thursday, Pamela's called six  times, Patricia, Kathy, Judy, Gayle  is pregnant, she says but... you  gotta get straight, honey, go to  sleep, get a massage, go to the  dentist, get a haircut honey, you  gotta cool out...
