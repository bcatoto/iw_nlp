I'm sorry... This is great, I could've spent four months on a romantic comedy with Warren Beatty, and instead, I've got a horny zombie trying to cop a feel! Uhgh, there's water everywhere... Can I get a cigarette? Geoff? Anybody see my boy? How long have you been here? How did it go with your father last night? I miss him too... I just don't want you to get your hopes up, okay? We're trying to work things out, but... You know everything, don't you? Yep. That's what you said the first time... Hi. I'm Marjorie Hargrove. Your new housekeeper. Is something wrong? I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews... I've always admired Ms. Hallow. That scene she did in Blue Midnight, where her lover meets her at the train station... I must've watched that movie four times. Oh. I'll get that... This is gorgeous. She wore this at the Emmys, didn't she? People, this is Geoff Matthews. He'll be joining our class for the rest of the school year... Why don't we save that for later, Doug? What about Julia Roberts? Susan! That'll be enough. Now is that any way to talk to your father? Gus, please... Really, Gus. It won't bother me. Knock it off, guys... Jesus, Gus, what have you done? Zowie? Unlock it, Drew! Open the door, Drew. I never knew an open wound could smell so bad... Honey, he should have been looked at this morning. I don't know what you were thinking. It's a wonder he's still alive. Fine. So who're you going as, Wayne Gretzky? Jason? Who's he play for? He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years. Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things... It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young. Hold still. Hold still. You make sure you're home by ten. If Gus finds out I let you go... Drew, I know Gus isn't your father, but you never even knew your real father. He walked out on the both of us, and you remember that. Gus isn't that way. He has it in him to love us both. You just have to give him a chance... You're home early. Uh... in his room... The Pet Sematary. Jesus, Drew, do you know what time it is? Did Gus ever find you? Drew? Drew, what happened? Gus, hon. I'm sorry about tonight. You coming to bed? God, you're ice cold... ...and you smell! Lord, what did you get yourself into? My God, Gus, what happened? Gus... stop it! What's wrong with you?! Gus!!! We saw your sign. Are there any kitties left? You'd be so much more interesting with blue eyes... I'm immortalizing a poodle. State your business! Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be? The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church". Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat? There's no "blood condition." The dog isn't sick, it's dead. And so was Creed's cat. And so was his wife the night she was killed for the second time... You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town. God damnit, Gus! This isn't funny! Chase. I miss you so much... I can come back, Chase... I didn't mean to... I was going to empty the hamper... What happened to you? You sure did... Here, let me do that... I hope he doesn't have rabies. Did you ever play that game where you pass a story down a row of people and see how screwed up it gets by the time it's done? People say Louis Creed's son came back from the dead and it drove him crazy... He killed his wife and himself, and that's the end of story. Anything else belongs in the National Enquirer. Sorry. Now tell me what that has to do with Zowie? Those poor people. I saw Gus this morning... he looked terrible. Doctor Matthews, you've got a call. It's the caretaker at the funeral home. Something about your wife's grave... I need you, Geoff... You sorry bastard. You stayed. I have nothing more to say to you, Matthews... What do you think? Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead. Geoff? Geoff? You okay up there? Jesus, Geoff! Don't sneak up on me like that! Did you really think you could be like me? Such a young face... but you've got potential... We'll do the eyes first. You always start with the eyes... I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again. Hello, Chase. We can try again, Chase. We can make it work this time. Don't you love me anymore, Chase? Geoff, honey, why don't you go downstairs. Your father and I need a moment alone. Do it for me? Geoff... I love you. Don't leave me again, Geoff! Don't leave me alone! NO, GEOFF! NO!!!
