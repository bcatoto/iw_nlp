Babe? Babe was a cute little piglet. He hasn't got any ID. No, you can't leave him with me. I've got...Hold on, I'll... She looks around, helplessly. She begins to unhook the red rope. Sidney tries to hide his excitement. Well, well, Sidney Young. Girl. Prick. Fuckwit. Why can't George leave? This magazine you are working for? It is good? Hollywood. Sodom and Gomorrah. Now everybody is celebrity. You take out your breasts, you are celebrity. In Poland, someone was famous because they had done something...Marie Curie...Pope John Paul... They brought your things yesterday. When do you start work? Well, you need to be fresh, make a good impression.(Leaving) Go to bed. A Kona please. I'm sorry, my boyfriend's sitting there. That's his White Russian. He'll be here in a second. (to Sexy Woman) This is a library card. (Reading it) From Glow-cester... Just doing my bit for the gene pool. Morgan Freeman? You had this laminated? Shit! Just...just leave it! Are you going to get off that seat? Do you know the meaning of Karma? (inscribing a circle in Hello? Hi, honey.(Beat) Oh. (Beat) no, no, it's...don't worry about it. I'll see you then. Bobbie? Hey! You want a seat? I'm just leaving. Thanks. The Woman takes Alison's place at the bar. I'm gonna powder my nose. Why don't you put on something a little more romantic? She staggers off down the hall. Sidney, giddy with excitement, searches through some LPs and puts one on his old turntable. It's Ace of Spades by Motorhead. He staggers around, playing air-guitar for a moment. Kowalski. You know what time it is? The music blaring, your door open... I hear the Cultural Editor's job is up for grabs? No. Get off my desk. Okay. Which way did you come in? Sidney stares at her. Alison takes some contact sheets from her desk and shoves them at him. Chris Blick exhibition opening. Caption it. Now get off my desk. One of the magazines gorgeous Fashionistas - INGRID - walks past. Hi! Hi, Ingrid. Ingrid stares at Sidney's outfit, thrown. This is Clark Baxter. (Noticing Ingrid's gaze) He's English. (That explains it) Ohh...right. Why do you have an alias? He uses it when he's trying to pick up transsexuals. Nice to meet you. She walks on. All right. But I am wearing Prada. The lift stops and she gets out. Alison gets in, sees Sidney and winces. She takes out a book and pretends to read. The lift begins to rise again. Through it's glass doors we see the different floors passing, different publications - each a hive of sober, hard work. Sidney stares at them. What did you expect? It's called being a professional. You should try it some time. By "you" do you mean "human?" Not that it's any of your business, but I'm from Port Huron, Michigan. You...you...arrogant... The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters. She is expensively dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of granite and an air of superhuman froideur. Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares tensely ahead. Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to the plunge in temperature. For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift. Then Sidney begins to choke on some burger. He wheezes for a moment, gagging. The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her. Alison closes her eyes. Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back of the oblivious Woman's Prada jacket. Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the offending item away. Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist in a vice-like grip. Are you insane? That was Lawrence's wife, Elizabeth! Her father owns Sharps! No! Listen to me - you do NOT approach Elizabeth Maddox, you do NOT talk to her! Don't even make eye-contact with her? Do you understand? Yes. I'm sure there are many words you don't know the meaning of! When I think of all the people who would kill to be where you are. And you lumber in here, spitting food, haven't got the brains God gave a mollusc...why  did Clayton hire you? What? His glory days? Sharps has won fourteen National Magazine awards and increased its advertising pages by more than 60 percent since he took over. He's paid millions of dollars a year. He  lives in a Bank Street townhouse, and weekends in the Hamptons. Clayton Harding is one of the lynchpins of the media-industrial complex. Sidney stops to examine his reflection in a window. Wall to wall what? Do you mind? Sidney was just marvelling at the abundance of "Totty" here. Lawrence Maddox? Oh my goodness... Long time. Rachel! Well, I'm just wonderful. Wonderful. How are you? Funny I should run into you. I've just done this great little film called Five Boroughs and it's you know, low-budget, first-time director but very, uh, moving and... Hey, maybe you could do a little...? Is that so? Right... What's your name, honey? Sidney Young. I'll remember that. Well, that's...I don't think there is one single film that... I don't, uh...well personally I love La Dolce Vita but... I beg your pardon? I don't think we've been introduced? Well, it's always nice to have fresh blood at these things. (To Maddox) Which reminds me, I'm here with Sophie Maes, I want you to meet her. New film, The Suffragette coming out, the buzz is A-mazing. The release is tied in with the roll-out of the Reebok campaign, and now Louis Vuitton's on the line. This train is leaving the station Lawrence. I don't really like that word, Sidney. You can call me Eleanor. She stares past him, across the pool. (on cell phone) Where's the car? What's it doing at the back? Forget what I said. I want the car at the front. Now. Sidney finds himself walking alongside Sophie and Maddox, trying not to stare at Sophie's breasts. ...I just think it's terrible the way we're still exploiting animals. That's why, you know, I won't wear fur or leather, I won't wear make-up, I'm vegetarian. I'm sorry, I can't understand your accent? I don't know. Have you? No. Are you ready dear? Okay. Good night. Maddox slips his jacket around Sophie's shoulders. Aren't you cold? No he isn't. For your information he wasn't pawing her! He was just doing his job! In case you haven't noticed Sharps has to have a star on the cover every month. And most of those stars are clients of Eleanor's. So do not piss her off. Will you...? Oh, and next time you want to do the hilariously ironic I love Con Air skit would you mind...? ...would you mind not involving me, especially in the presence of Vincent Lepak who happens to be very important. Who? No. Girls like Sophie don't date journalists. As far as she's concerned, you're the help. This is New York, Sidney. Women only date men who are successful... (as she goes) ...and tall. No, I'd love these but I'm so fat I couldn't... Get out of here! You look totally rexy. Alice? Alison hides her irritation with a smile. Alison. Tell Vicky she looks rexy. Rexy? Anorexic. Well...you do look like you could do with a few more pounds. Oh god, that's so sweet. By the way, post-shoot clear out. Got some Gucci pants here that are way too big for us. You wanna try? (another tight smile) No, thanks. I don't mean to be rude Sidney but...what the fuck do you want? I thought all this "fluff" was beneath you? What's changed? You're loathsome, you know that? Like ring-worm. He likes you. No, don't! It's so embarrassing! That picture's everywhere now. And I had no idea the dress was so see-through! And people are talking like it was some kind of stunt. Such a cynical age. Hello Sidney. Embarrassed, Sidney gets up from under his desk. Lawrence is taking us to lunch at Cipriani. Lawrence? Could I leave Cuba here? He doesn't like Italian food. That is a lovely ring. Where is that from? Oh, you Sweetie. That is very, very...(dismissing the topic) So, listen...You've met Vincent Lepak haven't you, Sidney? He has a new movie coming out soon and Lawrence is over- stretched as it is. How would you like to write a story on him? Well, great. Maybe we could get together and discuss the angle? Well, I'd need to know how we're going to present Vincent, check the story, so on. Any stories written about my clients need to be in their best interest, that's all. If things work out with Vincent we could maybe talk about a follow up story on Sophie? What do you think? Sidney dear, think of it like this: you write about one of my clients, you are borrowing some of their "star-light" to help sell your magazine. All I'm saying is quid pro quo. Sidney is unable to hold back a snicker. That's my bag. Stop it! Give me the... She tugs violently, pulling the bag open. A small PAW lolls out. Alison freezes staring at it. Silence. Oh my God. Oh my God. What are you doing? You can't...!  He jerks the window open and empties Cuba out of it,  slamming it shut just as Sophie, Eleanor and Lawrence walk  in. W-What? She darts a glance over to where Sidney stands with his back to the window, gazing at her pleadingly. From behind him comes a faint creaking sound. Sophie's dog! Have you seen him? Sidney hangs his head, awaiting the coup de grace. Uh...no. No idea. Sidney stares at her in amazement. Behind him Cuba's body appears at the window, rising into view on a WINDOW WASHING PLATFORM. A Window Washer, stands at the other end of the cradle, bobbing his head to the music in his headphones. Alison stares at the dog in horror while the others talk, oblivious. Cuba? Cuba! Cuba trundles on up to the sky. My God, you're like a serial killer. I don't want to know. It's okay. You don't need my help to screw up here, Sidney. I mean, the only things you make are mistakes and stains. It's...it's a novel I'm working on, alright? Go ahead. I know. I'm a walking clichï¿½. Yeah, it...I don't know. It keeps it separate from the magazine work. Makes it seem special. Uh, yeah, so... Actually he's a poet. What? He's very handsome, thank you. You know what I don't understand? You're desperate to get a story in the magazine - so why wouldn't you play ball with Eleanor, write the puff-piece? Well, that's good. Sidney smiles back at her. They look at each other...it's almost the start of a MOMENT... Then suddenly on the TV above the bar, a MOVIE TRAILER begins. Distracted Sidney turns to watch - it's Sophie Maes' new film - The Suffragette - Sophie, a glamorous Emily Pankhurst... Sidney looks back to Alison but she has turned away, suddenly awkward. Are you Lawrence Maddox? The new deputy editor? Well, I've just come to say congratulations on your promotion. I'm your present. The Woman produces a Beat-Box from behind her back and switches it on. She drops her coat to reveal underwear and stockings underneath. Maddox stares in frozen horror as the STRIPPER dances over to him, removing her bra. Hey Mrs Harding. Two Impeccably-Dressed Little Girls follow Mrs Harding into the room. Oh my God! So adorable! (to the Little Girls) And this is the Fashion Department. [To Ingrid] Where's Mr Maddox now? Oh he's down the hall. Room 217. You hired a stripper? I thought you wanted to be a success here? The famous alter-ego? How long's he been hanging around? How old were you? What did you expect, Sidney? Vincent's one of Eleanor's clients. I told you. They're Untouchables. Troy who? You cornered me. (beat, smiling) Alright. I'll have a beer. Sidney walks off. You write poems? Hello. (Turning back to the others) No, Lawrence is a wonderful writer. I really felt like he got to the heart of me. Sidney snorts. Rachel turns back to him, faintly irritated. I'm sorry, have we...? You okay? I said are you okay? Yup. (Beat) No, actually. I hate my life so, you know, I'm gonna get drunk. Sidney nods, vaguely. They stand in awkward silence for a moment. Then... What? I couldn't. That's why I've broken up with him. Which leg did you hurt? You know what? There's something very damaged about you. Like an animal that's been hit by a car or something. Like a deer or...like a pig maybe? When they walk funny and the other animals keep away from them. Little limpy pig. I'm drawn to sick animals. That's why I picked Cuba - because he had like psychological problems? (Her eyes well with tears) Poor little Cuba. Where is he now? Jesus, I'm wasted. Are you wasted? I'm wasted. Thanks. What's what like? Weird. It's happening so fast and...it's like it's got nothing to do with me. It's like I'm not even really here. She laughs softly. I'm so hungry. Are you crazy? There might still be a photographer around. They lie in silence for a moment. You know what would be nice though? Some coke. She rubs her face, close to falling asleep. None of your business... Firstly, you are a stupid asshole and I hate you and Secondly... Secondly... She muses on what she was going to say next. Sidney looks over his shoulder, imagining Sophie waiting for him. Secondly... Who'd care if I did? Beat. Suddenly she bursts into tears. Surprised, Sidney stands, uncertain what to do. I've got to go. Got to go. Sidney holds her to stop her falling. He stares back at the pool and then down at Alison. I thought I had it all figured out. A - get the hell out of Port Huron, come to New York. B - do the serious journalism thing to pay the bills while I, you know, write the novel. C- Win a Pulitzer. E... D - I don't know what D was. Then I took the internship at Sharps and I met Maddox and he was...he was so...and before I know it I'm writing, you know, Ten Tips for the fucking Metrosexual and pretending this is what I wanted but this ISN'T what I wanted! And that's...that's why I hated you... ...because you were right about me. I'm a ghoul, writing fluff! But he isn't the person you think he is, okay? Maddox. That's just a front. He thinks he's let himself down by giving up the poetry and he's unhappy. And the marriage is a sham, I mean... I just...I couldn't end it. I just couldn't and... Fine. Need a cigarette. Where are my fucking cigarettes? Oh yeah. Do you think I have low self- esteem? Am I afraid of a real relationship? Do I think an affair is all I deserve? I mean, okay, he's handsome and successful and he's great in bed... When I told him I couldn't see him any more...I don't know if he cared. I love him and, and I don't know if he cares! I'm so fucking sophisticated! I mean there's not even a little bit of Port Huron left, right? I've got the haircut and the job and I've got the parties and I've even, I've even got the affair because that's what sophisticated fucking people do! Oh G-God... (as she goes by) Love this song... Sooo, Sidney's dad. Good to meet you. I'm Alison. I'm from Port Huron. (To Mrs Kowalski) And you must be Sidney's mom? No I am not! Oh, okay. My dad married again too, so that's cool. (To Richard) You wanna dance? Okay. Where are my cigarettes? (feeling in the pocket of the jacket) What is that? Oh, hey, is that....? So, hey, visiting your boy. That's nice. You must be pretty proud of him, huh? He's doing just great at the magazine. First we all thought he was kinda creepy because he was always hanging around the water-cooler, hitting on women... But I think that was pretty much an act. So, Mister Sidney, whatcha doing here? A book! Hey - I'm writing a book. What's yours about? Don't tell me - it's a thriller, right? Philosophy? Really? Have you written any... Oh my God...Richard? R.C. Young? You're R.C Young? (To Sidney) You...you didn't say... What would Sidney know about philosophy? You're shitting me! Sidney? He...he likes Con Air! She stops laughing, hit by a sudden wave of nausea. I...I don't feel very well. Mrs Kowalski stands up. Come on. It is time you went to bed. (To Sidney) You can sleep on the couch. Okay. Better go before I find out something else I don't know about Sidney. Mrs Kowalski turns to Richard. It was a pleasure to meet you Lord Young. Alison stares at Sidney who smiles weakly. I don't remember very much but I'm so, so sorry. I'll get myself together and get going... Oh God...your father. And that woman. Thanks. Who's that? No way! Was she a model? Wow. Movies? Is she... Must have been pretty cool having your mom in the movies. You do? I don't know. I don't even know if I'm going to bother finishing it. Is that from Troy again? I'll jump in the shower and then I really will get out of your hair. Sidney watches, not wanting her to go. That's...I don't know what to say. (Beat) I haven't got a turntable. Are you kidding? I could throw up on you again. Hey, Alice? Versace. You like? I'm good, thanks. Honey, everyone needs to change their look every now and then. Especially if they have a new man in their life. What are you talking about? Tell me it isn't so. Of course not. Thank God. Can you imagine? He's such a creep. These are gorgeous, but I'm just too fat. Oh don't be crazy! Alice? Is Anna fat? Not at all. Why, she's so thin I could just take her little spindly body and snap it over my knee like a dry fucking twig. Thanks. Oh, and for your information Sidney Young has got more going for him than most of the men in this town. She gets up to leave, the others gawping after her. That's why I don't go there any more. They smile, but Alison seems a little nervous. I've been looking for you actually. There's, uh, there's something I need to... What? I can't understand what you're saying. I wanted to tell you. Lawrence has left his wife. We're going to be together. Officially. She watches for Sidney's reaction. Yeah, so...maybe he does care after all, right? Yes? I don't think so. The window begins to slide up. Sidney hangs onto it. Right. (Beat) How hot is she? The new talent? I guess you're right.(Quietly) What goes around comes around. Maddox is about to say something but changes his mind. Sophie's going to get a Golden Globe nomination for best actress. That is correct so we have absolutely no way of knowing whether or not she will be nominated. (Beat) So, if she is nominated we want Sharps to do a feature. Someone to cover the whole lead up, unrestricted access, the trajectory, the building of this unique brand. I'm going to have a logo. Here's the deal. Sophie wants you to do it. Sidney stares at her and then at Sophie, stunned. You can be my bitch. Merry Christmas, Sidney. This is a cover story. I think a little celebration is in order. Sexiest philosopher? Um...most evil philosopher. Most Hollywood philosopher? What'd he say? Oh honey, tell me something I don't know... Sidney stoops and snorts a line of coke. Hey. Nice robe. Who from? I just wanted to say I heard about you getting the promotion. Congratulations. I'm happy for you. Good. Fine. Everything's ...uh...I'm working for this little literary magazine. It's not the New Yorker but... (awkward) So, I've left you a bunch of messages... I thought so. Okay, well... Oh, well...still working on it. You know... Sidney? (a little wave) Hey, Alice. You didn't do it! You let me down! What are you? What? That's right! Okay, limpy pig. You need to pay a forfeit. Whatcha got? Give me your ring. Sidney stops dancing, his smile fading a little. Give me the ring. I want it. Okay, give me the ring and if I win tomorrow, I'll let you have sex with me. The on-lookers shriek with delight. Sidney stares at her. He looks past her to his reflection in the window - a drunk man in his underwear, swaying from side to side... (Celia Johnson accent) Don't worry Mary...you'll meet him one day. Oh, when you meet the One, you'll know... She walks on. Sidney stares at the screen. (smiling, hissing) What are you doing? Let her go! What the fuck are you doing? Soddom and Gomarrah. Oh God no...not the Versace... Security pile on Sidney... Finished.
