Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh? Travis? Thank you, Travis. How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers. Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days. Hello, Travis. Keep it. I'm getting a taxi. It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis. No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all. No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home. My God! I mean porno movies. You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to? These are not the kind of movies I go to. I'm leaving. What's wrong? But this is a porno movie. What are you doing? So you haven't heard this record yet? Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music. Travis, you haven't even played the record? You didn't have to spend your money -- ? Kris Kristofferson. The singer? That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". You know what you remind me of? You must be rich. You mean you work seventy-two hours a week. What hours do you work? That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet? Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night. That would have been quite a coincidence. The DMZ? You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable. Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else. Huh? Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis. The moon? That's really something. What did you do? Really? What kind of people? After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while. So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night? Where do you live? Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before. We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering. Thank you, Travis. Yes? All right. All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie. I don't know... Why? Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do? Well, we're all working tonight. If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something. Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging. You want to canvass? Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president. Is that so? But what do you think of Charles Palantine? No, I don't think so. That's someone else. What is it? I'm busy. No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure. No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point. First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it. Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary? As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them. He's Black, OK? No, why? He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when -- No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can. Oh, are you all right? This I gotta see. Try holding the match like this. I don't know -- but it feels like a long time. That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here. Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us? Have you been noticing anything strange? That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious -- Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it. Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere. Just what? Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious, Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings? Oh, Tom, please. No, I didn't forget "sexy". First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man. Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway. Tom, come here a moment. I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county. And don't forget to add the new photo releases.That's a dollar forty-seven. We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola. Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want? Awh, come off it, Pal.What do you mean? You don't have to. I sure hate to go alone... Sure you don't want to come with me? Do you really think I should go to the commune? You're not much with girls, are you? God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue. How? Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once. What should I do? Call the cops? Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls. God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me. Yeah. You a narc? What's so important? Why? You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell. Why not? Why don't you come to a commune with me? Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here. What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from... I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs. I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well. He never killed nobody. He's a Libra. Who's a killer? God, you are square. Didn't you ever hear of women's lib? Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there. Pittsburgh. ...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out... Well, you want to or not? Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow. That's not hard to do. I understand, mister. It means something, really. I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself. I can leave anytime I want. I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away. You can do it in my mouth. Don't you want to make it? Can't you make it? Oh, come off it, man. I musta been stoned. Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live. You want to make it like this? We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it? I don't remember. No. Why? Who are you? That's what you think. Iris. I don't like my real name. It's easy to remember. Easy Lay. Easy. It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long. That cigarette burns out, your time is up. A girl needs protection. All right. You see that guy over there? His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here. You looking for some action?Nice talking to you, Travis. I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes. There must be something... Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most? I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors. Why, thank you Travis. Yes I am.
