Breakfast is just about ready, Nick. Can I call you at the office? I don't know. I just thought I might  want to call you. I don't know. You say something? You sure you're OK, Nick? ...probably nothing at all. It's  probably just a bunch of, I don't  know, fatty cysts. You can have them  removed in a doctor's office. Has  Nick seen a doctor? He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers.  He never goes to doctors. Well, look. How's this? You go on  down to the clinic and tell that  nice Dr. St. Luc... ...you tell him that Nick's ill,  he's got these lumps, and he can't  get out of bed. Tell him to come  when you're sure Nick'll be home.  And don't tell Nick anything. Let  the two of them fight it out. He'll be really mad. So? You'll find out what's wrong and  then you'll be able to relax a little  bit. Let him be the uptight one for  a change. Oops, sorry. Hi. Haven't seen you  here before, have I? Ashen & Gaunt, Insurance Appraisals.  Mr. Tudor? One moment, please. I'll  buzz him. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'll  put you on 'hold' again and see if I  can find Mr. Tudor. Nicholas? There's a call for you. Nicholas? It's that man whose  Lamborghini caught fire on St.  Catherine Street and burned to the  ground. He's very angry... Nicholas! What happened? We're going to get you to a hospital.  That's what we're going to do. Do you see this? This is blood. It  came from your insides. That means  it's serious. Probably an ulcer. You  executives are all the same. Now, Nicholas, it doesn't cost  anything to be sure everything's all  right. I think you should definitely  go to the emergency ward and... Nicholas, I think... All right, Nicholas. All right. Excuse me, Brad. Gotta go. You'll come up and take a look at  him? That's great, Doctor. Thanks. Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting,  Doctor. I'm ready for you now, Brad. Now, you just take off all your  clothes, put this on, and hop up on  to the table over there, OK? Doctor'll  be in to see you in a few minutes. Don't be a tease, Brad. I'm still  working, you know. Hi. Hi. Want a drink? No thanks. Just wanted to tell you  that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see  Nick at ten or so. Was he nice to you? Good. Well... I've ordered in some vrai cuisine  fran�aise from Jean-Phillipe at the  C�te d'Azur restaurant. Escargots in  garlic butter... the works. They  have lovely strong delivery boys who  fight their way through sleet and  hail and the gloom of night just to  bring me my coq au vin. And after  Dr. St. Luc has told you that there's  nothing wrong with Nick that a  vacation won't cure, and if Nick  falls asleep early again, you just  come on back here for company and a  late supper. You hear me? Now, I mean it. I always order enough  for two and I'll just get fat and  lonely if you don't show up. C'mon, let's smoke one of the  cigarettes right now. Your father'll  never miss it. OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the  store and buy my own pack and smoke  'em all myself. With some milk jugs I just happened  to pick up on the way home. Jesus! Nick? I didn't know you were home.  What's wrong? What are you doing?  You're almost falling out of bed.  How are you feeling? Nick, does your stomach hurt? Can I  see those bumps on your tummy, can Oh, why won't you let me help you? OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you  wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor,  Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers  published by Hobbes, Linsky, and  Lefebvre in a couple of issues of  the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical  Association and also the Journal of  the American Medical Association.  And, as an added extra, a couple of  odds and ends from the files I helped  compile before your time here, Doctor.  I thought they might interest you. Do I get a kiss? Kiss, kiss? Another kiss? No. Dotty's the last. Roger? If you're going to be staying  here anyway, why don't you come up  to my place for a late supper? Doesn't matter to me how late it is.  I can keep it warm. Anything wrong? Well? Supper at my place? Great! Go back to your files. Bye. I'm hungry! I'm hungry! Hungry for love. Hungry for love. Eh, the children in this apartment,  they're such little thieves. You  have to put a lock on everything. Yes? Can I... can I help you? A man... I think I recognized him...  a man who lives here. He just... ...he just attacked me for no reason  at all. I just opened the door... I  was making supper for you, and he  grabbed me, he tried to kiss me... I think I... I think I killed him. I  stabbed him with something and he  fell. Oh, no! You're not leaving me here  all alone. I'm going with you. But where are you going? Nick? Are you up? I can't see a thing,  I took my contacts out. Nick, you're so strange... Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this. No, no. Nick, please. Stop. Let's  stop. I... I want to put my contacts  in... I can't see anything... I want to be able to see us, Nick.  I... I'm going to go into the bathroom  now and put in my contacts, OK? Is  that OK? I want to be able to see us when we  make love, OK? I'm here, Nick. Janine is here. Betts? Betts? It's me. Hello? Hello? Oh, Betts, Betts, everything is so  hideous. Everything dies and rots  and disappears. I'm going to die,  and you're going to die, and Nick... There, there, there. It all gets  sorted out in the genes and  chromosomes. It's not for us to think  about at all. It's not our problem  at all, 'Nine. We're just here to  exist and to have a good time. Exist  and have a good time. Do I feel good, 'Nine? Do I feel  good to you? Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You  have such a cosy body. I'm jealous,  I'm so skinny. Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you  to make love to me. Please, please  make love to me. Betts! You can't really be saying  that! You just can't! Let's not talk any more, 'Nine, shall  we? Let's kiss and make up. Let's  kiss... kiss and make up, shall we?  'Nine? Roger? Roger, are you here? Why don't you do something about all  that noise? We like parties, but  this is ridiculous. Oh, no! What a drag! Sometimes I have a recurrent dream.  Have I ever told you about it,  darling? I guess you could call it a  Freudian dream, because in this dream  I find myself making love to Sigmund  Freud. But I'm having trouble because  he's old and dying, and he smells  bad and I find him repulsive. And  then he tells me that everything is  erotic, everything is sexual, you  know what I mean? He has a very thick  accent, but I can understand him  perfectly. He tells me that even old  flesh is erotic flesh, that disease  is the love of two alien kinds of  creatures for each other, that dying  is an act of eroticism, that even  chemicals combine out of sexual frenzy  and longing. That breathing is sexual,  that talking is sexual, that just to  physically exist is sexual... And I  believe him, and we make love  beautifully... Hellooooo? Oooooo? Is there anyone  here who's all alooooooooone? A kiss! Give him a kiss. Give him a kiss.
