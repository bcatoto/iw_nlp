What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue. You'll visit again? Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer. Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not. Dead, dead, dead. She's dead! As fair as me? Is she fair, this princess? Princess? I know of no princess. Ask away, sweet man. Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map. Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night... You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth. Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury. That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished. Couer de Noir! A demon if the Devil ever made one. Why then, there thou hast. We be lucky worse has not befallen us. I like well your conceit, Jack. Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world. The moon is too round of face, methinks. Think me fair, do you, Jack? Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks. Well spoke, boy. You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be? What's this now?To be strong and free... that is all I desire. Yes. I feel that, too. Weakness is what is ugly. Now I want to live forever. I've never felt so strong or happy. It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust. I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die... And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures... Might we watch, too? It sounded like it came from the courtyard. What was that? Did you hear that? You're a beast! I don't expect you'd understand. Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul! I see... What will become of me then? And then? Oh, yes... What do you want from me? Don't please... I'll do what you desire... No more... please... Kill me... I want... so nice... Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me... Do it now! Damn you! I'd soon die. Why have you brought me here? Do you feed on mice and rats? Like some vile toadstool. Protection? Then why hide behind a mask? You are ashamed! And you... are you not also afraid? You... you're a beast! God protect me. You lie! You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough! Grotesque... monstrous... But I'm hideous! You are cruel! Your heartless jesting worse than torture! How can you speak of love when you see what I am! Your words sting more sharply than your whip. What do you want with me? Oona? Do you suppose it's a faerie? I can't see a thing. Pinching? Where? Biting you? What's the matter? And I love you, my husband. You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack. Like a true Prince... a champion! Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband. I want none other. Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word. Seemed like weeks and weeks. Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you... Sweet Jack. I'm so sorry you found me asleep. Don't know what came over me. Oh! Green Jack! What a dream I've had... proper nightmare. And I... love you... In the dark... where I join him... That's why he goes masked during the day... Sunlight... It destroys him. No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light... You've freed me, Jack... I was bewitched... it's better this way... Only what's right... Jack... Forgive me... Do you wish it, Jack? Wish you this our wedding band? Then, perchance you'll me. Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack? Let it. Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in? Oh, la... Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions. If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...? Do you wish to marry me, Jack? A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me. Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so. I don't want to be reminded of what happened. I don't want it on me. Oh, yes, and the mare with him. It happened so fast. He was hurt and ran away. My own father... I didn't know... I didn't... It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I... My father and the Baron. I don't know. They've hurt the unicorn. Where are you going? I've no fear of failure. Your implications are most unbecoming. He'll not flee if I show myself? Jack! Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one? It would thrill me so. Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia. I am a princess. You have no right to order me about. How much longer? The napkin will keep. I'd rather not be alone. Don't leave me now. I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you. I've lost my napkin. It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so. Oh, dear. What shall we do? I detest serpents. A gentleman would offer water. Let's rest a minute. I'm so thirsty. A promise is a sacred oath. Oh, fie. What about the unicorn? The Baron is a frightful man. They say he's an ogre. He wears a mask so none may see his face. It's my father, gone a-hunting. The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport. Liar! But you did... you did! You promised! If you like. Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.True north... Straight up that pass, through the net. Is this a May Day pageant? Are you all off on a lark...? The raven passed this way hours ago! You beware, Jack! You and your porridge-pot heart! I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter. What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel! Why should I feel such pain? Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away... You... you... you mortal you! What shape I take matters not. Long you for another? I'll give you your heart's desire. A faerie's love makes anything possible. Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack. And sweet? Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag. Jest with me then. Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth? And am I not fair? Do I not please you, Jack? Fie! Don't speak of charms. I should charm you for being so dull- witted. Only that? I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk. Mayn't I come visit sometime? Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night. Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it. No need for bells, Jack. I'll nay enchant ye. Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you. Sorry. Courage, Jack.This time you're really going? You know where I'll be. Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye? Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help. We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack. He said he'd... look into it. I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns. It's one thing to know it... This is a brutal land. Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday. Didn't Paden tell you that? You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again. Goodbye? I'm surprised to see you out here tonight. I guess I put a good scare into him. They've been kind to me. Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back. More than enough. I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman. Because they don't like what I want. They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts. A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it. Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together. Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it? We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that. I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back. It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings. Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody. Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people. J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking. McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.You can't do this. What are you talking about? You wanted to see me? Howdy.Shut up. You need help, don't you? Because I'm your sister. What makes you think I could? What's stopping you? Why come to me? Get out. We have nothing to talk about. I don't have any family any more. It's none of your business. Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed. Who did it? What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.I've got a place I can hide her. He can't hurt me if he's dead. How about you? I'm ready for that. Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it. Nah! What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it? Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about. If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening. Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good. What is it that I can't figure? Where's the dog now? You really are a gambler. That's the good stuff. I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather. Here he comes right now. I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly. Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked. That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side. You see that fellow over there in the gray coat? Me too. What's wrong with us? You like a good saloon? Thanks. That's what I call it too. I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night. Stella. The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations. I run the place. What can I get you? From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money. I wouldn't worry about that. That was my plan.I don't know... I don't know... I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened. I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished. It's not my time of month. It's not that... it's not that... Yes, Mother. They were stained. I burnt them. No. It made them holy. In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins. Yes Mother. I don't know. I'm being punished. Of God. No I don't... the host is enough. I'm not hungry. But she watches... she listens. Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen. God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said... No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp. I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven. Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child. That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful. Look at the statues, they're thin. It's a sin to be fat. No he doesn't. He hates fat people. I do, I have to be attractive to God. Because... I'm a blimp. I am, there's too much flesh on me. Because I'm getting fat. No. She'd punish me. I can't say. Yes. No. I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can. I put her to sleep. She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake. Yes. Yes. Yes. I don't remember. It was dead. God! It was God. And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him. I hate him. For what he made me go through. I hate him for what he did to me. I hate him... Not your fault... No... Stay away from me... It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop. Let go of me, I wish you were dead. Yes. Yes. From the belltower the day she before she died. She'd seen him too. Him. So I could go to him. Yes. The statue. She had shown it to me the day before. She said Michael. Yes. Yes. Yes. Frightened. No... don't hit me please... Go away, I don't want you here. They can't hear me that's why. Oh God... I don't wanna... Of me. Oh... God! My God... Water... it's all water... I don't know which one I have to throw up... I feel as if I've eaten glass. Yes. For me to get sick in. No. A wastepaper basket. A crucifix. My bed. Sister Marguerite I think. Someone's following me. I left early because I wasn't feeling very well. We went to chapel for vespers. I hate them. Fish... ... brussel sprouts. I ate. I'm afraid. She made me promise not to. I can't tell you that. No. Yes. It grew. May I open my eyes now? Yes. Because I wasn't worthy. Because I was afraid. No. Yes. It came out of me. I had a baby. Of telling you. I'm frightened. Because I'm in trouble. To help me. Doctor Livingston. Yes. As much as Mother Miriam does? Do you really love me or are you just saying that? I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake... Yes I am. No I'm not. Yes. No I'm not. Alright. I'm afraid. She touches me down there with a cigarette. Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more. And then... Her headaches. Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby. She says my whole body's a mistake. Yes. Yes. ... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me. ... makes me... She... She watches... she listens. She can. Yes. I can't. No... I breathed! I'm always bad. Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her. Answer me! You never answer me. Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you? That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget. I'm not sick. Everything... I don't have children. I was a mistake. Not my fault. I can't help it if I'm stupid. If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... A mistake... it was a mistake... A mistake... From someone who didn't want to have a baby. Because I don't want one. Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby. I could never be a mother. Yes. She'd get angry. No, but I can never tell her that. No. No. An angel, when she was having one of her headaches. You'll laugh. I don't know. Somebody told her. She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away. I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew. No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep. Where did you go? Oh, it's even more wonderful then. I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head. Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end. Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things. No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died. She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that. She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful. I don't know. No... do you? Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes. Where do you think babies come from? One. No questions. Why do you smoke? Why not? Would you like some? Do you have any children? Would you like to be? Are you married? What's your real name? Anything? What do you mean? No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions. No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me. I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby. Don't you know? I... I don't understand. From God. No, they say it came from the waste paper basket! From their heads... What baby? Yes. I fell asleep. I got sicker. I went to my room. Down... there. Yes. Something I ate. No. I was sick. I don't know. I never saw any baby... I think they made it up. You want to talk about the baby don't you? In the confessional. Oh, yes. At least once a week. Yes. No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell. Oh, I know he does. Oh, yes! Oh, there are so many. Yes. I love you. Right now? Everyone. Yes. Love. God! But there's nothing to say about God. Yes. I don't know. Let's talk about something else. No I'm not. That wasn't me. No I don't. Yes.The bishop is breathing down our necks. The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us. Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law. Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison. Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.Who are you? I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood. And you believed me. You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God. Not any more... now I like chocolate. Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite. Who are you? Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.H... how? What did you do? And then... what did she do? Agnes what did she do? You saw it all didn't you? She took the baby in her arms? Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she? It was alive wasn't it? Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him. Agnes, who did this to you? Who? Yes. Of course you do. Who was it? Agnes who did you see? He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women. Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand? Agnes... Agnes... Are you frightened? So she sent you? Where? How did she know about him? Who? Why? And the passage to the barn? What did she mean? I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember. Agnes, can you hear me? That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand? Do you remember what just happened? Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three... It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel? Is someone in the room with you? Who? Why isn't anyone coming? Of what? Which one? What do you do? What do you feel? Are you ill? What do you think it's there for? Do you know who put it there? Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it? What else? Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby? Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night. Who? What is it? Hm hmm. And then what happened? You don't like brussel sprouts? Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner? Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed. Who? Who made you promise? It's alright Agnes. It's alright. Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick. Will she be angry? Did anyone else know about the baby? Would you like to tell me? What made it grow? Do you know? No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you? Why? To be a mother? Why were you afraid? Why? Did you want it to come out? Did you know what was going to come out? How did you have a baby? But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble? Of what? What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble Agnes? Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here? And why am I here? Who am I? You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me. As much as God loves you. I really love you. Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you. You're a mistake. Are you intelligent? Agnes, you're stupid. Are you pretty? Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Please! I want to help you. Let me help you. Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright? What? Oh, yes. How does she know that? Why? That you're a mistake? And that you're stupid? She tells you you're ugly? Yes? Yes? Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her. How? She can't hurt you any more. She's dead isn't she? You can tell me. Agnes. What did your mother do to you? If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you? Did she make you do something you didn't want to? Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it? Did it embarrass you? Did it... did it hurt you? What did she make you you do? What did you do? What did you do? Sometimes, yes. Agnes... And you're unhappy. But you're troubled... aren't you? Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you. Agnes... What the child? ... and that you don't believe you carried a child. ... that you don't remember getting pregnant... Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex... Is that what she said? Agnes, how did your mother get you? How would that person get one if they didn't want one? Like you? If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one? Why not? Why not? Did you ever want to be a mother yourself? Agnes, did you love your mother? Why not? Mmm? Do you believe she really saw them? Do you? Did your mother see angels often? I promise I won't laugh. Who told her? Agnes... Who? How did she know that? What things? You have trouble sleeping? Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else? It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl. What happens if the bell rings and you're under there? Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down. I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head? Like what? No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies? Sister Paul was in her eighties? Did she climb up here often? What else did she tell you? You liked Sister Paul? Why should I? Do you know a Marie? From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know. What? Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions? Does it bother you? I've stopped menstruating I can't have them any more. No. Not at the moment, no. No. Martha Louise Livingston. Anything. Just that... you ask and I'll answer. Would you like to ask them? Agnes... Then let's talk about something else... Yes I do, but I want you to... Agnes, how are babies born? After God... before the waste-paper basket. Where'd it come from before that? Is that where they say it came from... ? The baby they made up. Where did the baby come from? In the middle of all the pain? And then what? And what happened? And what did you do? Where? Did it hurt? How were you sick? Do you remember the night they said it came? Why should they? Would you like to talk about it? Where do you meet? And you like that? Often? You've been alone together? He's told you? Do you think he loves you? Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau? Who? Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ? Uh huh. Well, who in particular? Who? Have you ever loved anyone? Second thing that comes to your mind. First thing that comes to your mind? Anything... may I sit down? What would you like to talk about. Hasn't anyone ever told you that before? Was it Sister Marguerite? I just heard you. You have a lovely voice. Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I? Sister... What? Agnes? Who? Mother Superior? And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be? Why? No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit. Eve, she strangled a baby! Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here. Thanks. Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be. Larry... I don't know. Something they... that they overlooked. Larry there's got to be something missing. Larry... Thanks... Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will. I can get you new evidence next week. Next week. I'll have it. Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby. I'll have a decision by next week. Yes, that's because I'm getting to her. All I want is one more week. I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this. Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here. What about Roger? He's free. I... I'm Martha, Mama. Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me! Marie's dead Mama. Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right? I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite. It's Martha, Mama. There you go. It's your favourite... Hello, Mama ... brought you something. Uh huh. The one up on the third floor? Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room? Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you? How do you survive? I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..? Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to... What business is it of yours..? Who told you this? What does this have to do with..? Why do you call it an investigation? I never have. No. Wasn't it! What happened to the baby? Agnes, what happened to the baby? I doubt that's what she'd say. Before or after you killed the child? You tied the cord around its neck. And the baby. You hid the wastepaper basket in her room. You wanted that child out of the way. You went to the room to help with the birth. The baby? Too late for what? For what? An abortion? And you didn't send her to a doctor. Did you know she was pregnant? Was it you? Who knew she was pregnant? I have a few more questions to ask her. Where is she? Who was that person Mother? Was it you? Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room. Oh, would you stop lying Mother! Somebody told her. There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out. That's what I have to believe... But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line. But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing. I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother? But how did it happen? You're saying God did it? This is insane. Well give me a reasonable explanation How ? My God, you're as crazy as... Who is he? How? How? She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle. You think she's a saint? For the Church? One that will ask the questions you want asked. You're what? NO... no... I said leave her alone. Of course. No. The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove? I'd like to begin. Do you think Agnes is still attached to God? Well you can try, can't you, to be good? Do you want to become one? Do you think they ever existed? Right. What do you suppose today's saints are smoking? Oh, you've come a long way baby. Right... Saint Peter? Hand rolled. Long, thin and filtered. Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then? All right? Would you like one? Huh? My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. Does my smoking bother you? No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles. I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me? I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston. That's all? That's enough! She was a beautiful little girl. It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said? She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers. Nothing... You just said... Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality... Bullshit! Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh? An unhappy woman... I don't give a damn about her spiritual health. The woman's health is at stake. Don't deny it! I'd like yours too. Oh, God. Why didn't you do anything to stop her? Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic. There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets. She molested her! Do you know what she did to her? Listening to angels? Like keeping her home from school? And Agnes' father? No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it? Your niece! You lied to me Sister Paul? When was that? What sheets? What is it? Was the child full term? Take at look at it. Do you have a... a diary or a day book? Visitors to the convent. Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time? When would Agnes have conceived the child? Answers. Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court. Aquittal. There's another choice. No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world. Then help her. ??? ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by. And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God... ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant... ... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are? You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child. How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured... How dare you tell me to run my affairs! I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church. I hate ignorance and stupidity. What? And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it? It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim. Not simple, no. She has it now. She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand! She could have bled to death. Why didn't you take her to a doctor? This was before her pregnancy? And what happened? And you weren't shocked? When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks? Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him. That possibility never occurred to you? One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal. It's possible isn't it? That she was unconscious, yes! So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the... And in your eyes? So, someone else could have done it. If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child? That's ridiculous... How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth? From other nuns... Yes I... I've noticed. What's your opinion? I am not with the Inquisition. The science of psychiatry. Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here. Why do you think that? Look, someone gave her the baby. Why haven't you asked her? And you didn't try to find out who? Could there have been anyone else? What's his name? Was there a priest? What man had access to her? Who was the father? Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time? How did she hide it during the day? Is that normal? How did she hide it from the other nuns? Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy? I can beat that. You were a smoker? ... Thank you. Yes... I...That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets. For what? Should you see a doctor? What do you mean? A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility. Say it! How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of. Why? Then tell me. Where are your sheets? It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets? Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin? We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister. Why? Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true? Dear Jesus... Why? Yes, of God. My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything. You've got to eat something Agnes. Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat. Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead. Who? Oh my dear child. Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where... That's not what he meant. Who tells you these things? Agnes... Why? Who told you this? He loves you the way you are. ... You needn't worry about being attractive here. Why does it matter whether you're fat or not... Agnes... Oh, for Heaven's sake. Who? One of the other Sisters? Why? Who? Through someone else? He talked to you Himself? Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES I've been commanded by God. Oh, don't do this! She can't remember. That's enough. Then she's a liar. I left it with her and I went for help. I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked. No! I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets. That's a lie. She didn't want any help. The scandal... I don't know... too late to stop it. Oh, don't be ridiculous. I didn't guess until it was too late. Yes. Is it because she's a nun? Why do you insist upon pressing... My God, but you're determined. Hasn't she had enough? This is permission to take her apart. If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes. I'm concerned about her health. Why would I lie? Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years. That's crazy. How could she find out about it? Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her? You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why? That's what you believe she is? The sum of her psychological parts? She is an innocent. But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe. You'll never find the answer for everything God did. There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out. A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb? Don't be ridiculous. Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying... Why must he be anybody? The father! She's been touched by God, yes. For Agnes. One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect. If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case. Stop this, she'll hurt herself I'm not going to allow this. Then let's begin. May I be present? Would it stop you if I did? Begin what? Listen to her singing. Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth. No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles. Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles. Become? One is born a saint. Yes I do. There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking. And Saint John would chew tobacco. Mary Magdelen? Pipe! Even Christ would partake socially. Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet. And of course Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More... Fine thanks... I'm out of prac... ... practice. I'd love one. No, it reminds me. So you left the Church because you had freckles? And what has that to do with it? Stupid woman... and that's all? What have we done to hurt you? And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do? Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin? What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you? Who said anything about the Catholic Church... Bullshit yourself! Because I am a moral person. She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone. I know you don't. Her spiritual health. I haven't decided yet. We'll see about that. And my permission? Because I didn't know... I knew that after the fact. Oh God, if only I'd known. Oh, dear God. I don't think I care to know. She drank too much. That's what killed her. Yes. I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened. I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important. About what? Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room. The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away. Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed... The sheets... Oh, Dear God... There's nothing here. Yes. Nothing. Earthquakes? Oh, some time in January. All right, what do you need. How? What? What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin. I am... I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. ??? She is not a child. I'm only interested... It's my affair too. Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else... The Catholic Church... Nuns... you hate nuns. You hate us don't you? God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God. I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that? I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple. But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that. It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again... About two years before. She stopped eating completely... I was appalled, just as you are now. Shortly after she came to us. Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made. This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark. No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes. That's absurd! Who? You don't really believe something like that happened do you? I've already told you what I thought. No... not in the eyes of the police. She didn't! This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her. In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book. Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God. From other people! I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying. I believe Agnes is different. Well... what do you think? Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar. And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are! I don't want that mind cut open. Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination. Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally... Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient. Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial. She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception? Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes. Obviously there was. Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate. Yes, but I... None as far as I know. I haven't a clue. We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits. She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to. Yes. She undressed alone... she bathed alone. No-one. Unfiltered. Two packs a day. You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters. You can call me Sister. I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...Yes. Oh that one there, in the corner. No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public. Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves, some wheat, corn, some vegetables. The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.I think I know exactly what you mean. You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date? I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you. Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous. Hi, Marty! Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet. But he didn't ask me. Nine o' clock. Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later. Then you'll be going to school here....? Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay. You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night. You remember me...? Hi, Marty. Have we ever met before? Poly-what? Here's your jacket! Seventeen. I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl! You mean you're going to stay up all night? That's good. Learn anything? How was school today? I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me? How are you? Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance? George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation. By the way, that reminds me... Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food. Now, George! Dinner's ready now!What did you do to yours? Hi, Marty! Is something going to happen Saturday night? Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did? Can you imagine your parents in bed together? No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.Do you mind if I use your bathroom? Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise? You don't have to sing it. It's reply paid.I'm waiting for my daddy. Layton. Her name is Jill.Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up! I bet you'd like to touch them? You think these are tits don't you? You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you? But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now? Where do I get it stamped? Stamped? Yes. I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in. I want to report a wrongful arrest. What do you think? ... is it me? Take care. Don't do anything silly. Where are you going? Don't you like parties? Yes. They're gone. Your face ... are you hurt? Yes. No you're not! Oh ... Jesus! I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special. You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me? Leave me alone! Go away. Are you still following me? Yes. Come out, I know you're in there What? Shit! The house is on fire! We? Don't blame me! Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here! Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us! Let go! We've got to stop! Stop it ... damn you! Get away! Cut it out, Sam. I thought you arrested me. You're joking. Who will? What? Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day. Look at that - right on time. How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists? Who is this war against, Sam? Say, all wars have innocent victims. Why don't you say, no system is perfect. They couldn't be worse for the Buttles. We've got both. Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does? I mean, it doesn't suit you. No, really. What are you doing in Information Retrieval? A heavy Christmas present. What parcel? What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties. It does doesn't it? Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me? It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going? I didn't like it. I didn't run away. I left the flat. I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I? It's my fucking life. Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval? I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams! Don't litter my cab! Them? No. Who are you? Good! How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm? Who are you? Let go! Mrs Buttle, are you alright? Are you alright?I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ... Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please. We're meeting Mrs Terrain. You remember Samuel, my son. Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas. Not now ... please Sam!!! It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor. Yes he is - he wants to talk to you. Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here. Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams. Sam ... you haven't had dessert. Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval. By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens. What were we saying? It's something for executives. I hope you like it. It's very exclusive. Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there. No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body? What have you done with his body? My husband's dead, isn't he? Mistake?Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie. My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother? Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace. I know, I know ...! There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ... Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists? That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive. It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman. Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have? I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to... But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them! I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done. We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will... You are dying, too. NOOOOOOOOO! Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest. TONY....TONY.... Dios mia.It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on... We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly. Tonight? I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by... THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS... Sir. It's quite clear that... ...Captain Rhodes is trying to... I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab. Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is... You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it! Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned. If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson. Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright. You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH! Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!! You gave them a fresh taste of blood! You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat! God....damn you, Rhodes! I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and... I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland. I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need... I want you to leave. Then maybe... It's because of me. Some of Rhodes' men. At the door. Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.Come on. Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look. Look. What is it? No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know. Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him. Help me get him to the boat. How long do we have to watch him? It's...he was...one who came to the island with me. Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes. There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat. Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel! What? Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys. Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in... They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment. No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here! I can find it myself. I didn't come that far. Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic. Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch. We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet! It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain. Curse? The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth. Thanks. I can fight my own battles. We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns. Governor Dickerson? Of Florida? Gasparilla?It doesn't hurt. Why doesn't it hurt? What was that? Why you don't feel love? Not allowed? Dead inside, maybe? You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you? In-vulnerabo? Bullshit! Yes you can. I know. I go with you. Go United States. See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics. Buy Cadillac. Watch "Dynasty." You try get across Laos? Get to Thailand? In-vul-nerabo. But you get ass kicked without me. You think you are... . Carefully. Don't want to get shot by you. Bad karma. Anyway, you need me. Took bus, most of way. I knew you would come here. Rambo. NVA coming. Pig dog Kinh say meet them here. Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out. They heard about escaped prisoner on radio. Make deal. More than we pay. Yes. But I lose many merits in next life. Very bad. Nguyen is good boy. Huntington Beach, California. Nguyen. He twelve now. Not see him for eight years. Oh. They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon. Make deal. Spooks? Crazy motherfucker. Where did you find this clown? I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there. Empty for years. I have arranged transportation. We meet soon. But I think you to be disappointed. Sure. I only sound like forty-year- old in your language. It means "virgin." My mother was comedian.I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you. Not mine, stupid. Yours. God, I haven't seen you since the wedding. John Ultramalensky, right? I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I? Where are you going?Till then. Cash. I'm impressed. This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages. That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars. You may be right. I agree. You should have proved that in a court of law. I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out. Until she remarries, Fletch. I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence. You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars. I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband. Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.Who's Frieda? And, I'm sorry, who are you again? Jim Swarthout?I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.' I want to hear this. Don't worry, I can take it. I'm terrified. Don't tell me I can't -- I'm calling the police. Right now. Bastard. Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist??? What is this.... Oh God, I hate things that start like that.... I've never lied to him before. It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.' But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking. I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today. I was afraid you'd say that. Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours? What are you talking about? No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill... Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know. Stop it. Are you saying my husband is defrauding me? But I've seen the deed. Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in -- What does all this mean? How do you know about that? What are you talking about? So? Who. I'll cover it. You have any other surprises? A four hundred dollar lunch tab! Why did you do it? I think you should call me Gail, now. What is this? He never sees them and I never met them. Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there. Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom. Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry. No. I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else. Depends on the question. Just like Alan. It's freaky. Your bone structure, shoulders, neck... It's amazing. You were in the war? All this goes on Underhill's bill? God... Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you? I mean put clothes on. I really should change. Down boy. You ordered it here? I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want? Uh... I'm just out of the shower. Hi. John Ultramalensky? Who is it? None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off. See what I mean? If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman. Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you? Alan's in Utah. I bet you do. Stay! I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player. I love the outfits. Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one! What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied. Damn, I thought I had that one. Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little. That's a strange combination. Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really. John who? John! You used to fly together! Oh, mine! Thank God. Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's? I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are. In a minute! I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute? You don't know the Underhills? John! Yes?I guess not. That's it. Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here. Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign. Is there anything particular you're looking for? Here you are, Doctor. Yes, right away. Oh my God! Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted. Can I get you something? You're in the Records Room. Are you all right, Doctor? Nothing. They're still there.Will you kill me? What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service. That's right. Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else. I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent. It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent. Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM. LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you. Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment. Do you have a passport? Get me on the first shot, if you can. Precisely. Are you a good shot? Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray. In this drawer.... I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets. I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off. These will be open. I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will. Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you. You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks. My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not. I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it. I want you to murder me. Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent. Come inside. Who? Alan Stanwyk. It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you. One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr... I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut. I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk. Because we can't. We can't talk about it here.How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party? Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception? She's cute as a button. Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some. Cute thing. His bride. Cute as a button. Cute young thing, too.Yor dad picking the music again? I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks. Any cute guys gonna be there? Hi, guys.He can't hold you Jesse. He's losing his grip - you can get out. I love you, Jesse. Come back to me. I'm not afraid of you. You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back. I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch! I want him back. Jesse, talk to me. Jesse! Where's Jesse? Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him! Jesse, help! We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital. Hi. You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear. Fight him, Jesse! No, Jesse. This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up. Who? Who's doing this to you? Who, Jesse? Oh, Christ, you're hurt... Jesse, God - what happened? We'll figure it out together. We'll stay up all night if we have to. I won't let anything happen to you. You're not being fair to me. I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing. Why won't you talk to me? I wish you'd talk to me. We can figure it out, you know. We can figure it out together. You should eat something - you'll feel better. You want to talk about it? you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here. You had another nightmare, didn't you? Will you stop and tell me what's wrong? Oh, Jesse... What is it? What is it - What's wrong? Ghostbusters are fearless. Maybe we can do that. Strictly scientific, of course. Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it? I'll get over it. About what? Anything? Shhh. Just concentrate. I don't know. Concentrate or some- thing. C'mon, cut it out. I thought you might be able to make a connection. So, you feeling anything? Here. Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room? Fred Krueger worked here. It's an old power- plant - a steam generator! It's a surprise. What about "essential energy" the soul. Does that go into the air too? You think there's a good energy and a bab energy? Make a left at this corner. And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die? Look, you got electricity in your body, right? You don't have to. You just have to believe in energy. At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before. But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do. It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals. Research. Hi. C'mon, let's go for a ride. I just got here myself. Went to the Public Library. Cut four classes! I don't know. Who? This is amazing! Your dream told you where this was? World History. But, I'll see you in the morning, right? Are you okay. Wow... "March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again. I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love." I think it's sad... Uh-uh. Before my time. I figured you might like some help. I know. You mean a shithead. You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk. Let me look at your eye... You okay? That's okay, I wanted to. Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that? How come? Mom's trying to keep him upstairs. All of them. Hi, Kerry. Thanks, Mom. You're going out? What's that? Okay...thanks.I don't know! I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him. He needs professional help. I think we should take him to a psychiatrist. Ken! Oh, please... I wasn't sure, Ken... How'd you sleep, honey, okay? Jesse, please, let's talk about this! Sure...go ahead. Maybe we should call a doctor. Making friends? So, school going alright? I know it's warm... I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken. You okay? Eggs? Jess? 'Morning, honey.We're going up to bed now. We're going to bed. We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night. There's a Jesse on the phone.The moon's not down yet... Sure, Uncle Al. I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either. Blue. This blue. Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters? If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters? Uncle Al- You're a real booger, you know it? Are you all right, Marty? Don't you touch me, snotbrains! Will you? Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains. Went shopping. Why? Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning. Let me help you up. What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed? I don't want your money. You're a booger. What's the money for? If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it. Brady's a booger and so are you! You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!I will- be good, kids. You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow! And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come! Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and- So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this. Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty? Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know. And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's- Rattling. Rustling. I've been hearing noises in there. There's something else scary. I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but... For getting a divorce? What's that? You booger.John, why?... John, I don't understand any of this. Who are these orphans, anyway? That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut! Anyway, they like Fred. Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think? How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company I don't know where he is. Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace! He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know � anybody who knows John � knows that's a goddamn lie! Did you find him? Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay? No? Why not? God, Fred... What's so funny? You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work? Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John. You didn't have to... Oh. John said you're Amish. Everything okay?Here. Whenever you want them. I want you to take this... to remember by. That's God's way! What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven! There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land! I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough. Just as I could live yours! You're so sure of that? I was being foolish? There was a time when I would have welcomed it. There was a time when I thought you might have stayed. You should not bother with that birdhouse. If you're leaving tomorrow. I see. But I hope you have a lot of sugar. Eli is ready to go to Zook's. When will you be going? But... You may not be well enough. I'm sorry. I'm sure it is. Whacking is not of much use on a farm. What else can you do? You know carpentry? We had some lemonade and he left. Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago. Oh. The bullets. You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry. But Stoltzfus said... Well... the store at Saltzburg... But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while. Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even. You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint. Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain. Buttons are Hochmut. I should tell you these do not have buttons. See? Hooks and eyes. Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers. Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these. Enjoying your reading? It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for. That is not for Samuel. John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible. You tell him. When you're able. But you can't. Two days. What? Only the elders. The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life. But � But why? But John... why didn't you go to a hospital? What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial? Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast. You said we would be safe in Philadelphia. You couldn't wait until morning? Where are you taking us now? I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home. But why would they murder... Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman? Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows. She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility. Your sister said you don't have a family? But not a good tired. I would not be too sure. No you're not � You're glad, because now you've got a witness. I heard the other police talking last night. They don't seem to like you very much. We do not go into your courts. Yes. And I also want to leave this city. The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people. He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you. It's not a joke. You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws! You have no right to keep us here. Where are you taking us? Samuel. Samuel Lapp. But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon. You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way. But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night. At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way. Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him. I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first. Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit. Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee. I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night. Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish! Good morning. Yes. Yes, thank you very much. I have to help him! You shame yourself. I will be the judge of that. I am not a child. That is idle talk. I have committed no sin. I have done nothing against the ordnung. Eli, John is a carpenter. As well as being a fine policeman. I know God help me, I know that, Eli. But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel. We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows! I know. No... His name is John Book. Yes. Samuel! We're going. John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant. He's from... Ohio... My cousin. My son is out there! You might have killed him! You have no right here! No, you listen. Get out! I know. Sleep now, Liebchen. They are English. They don't understand. No... No. It is just the English way. Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
