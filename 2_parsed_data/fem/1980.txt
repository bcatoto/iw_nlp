That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me. No. I'm all alone. Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff. I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me. Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer. Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to. Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.? No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men. Ah, won't you sit down? That's very nice of you. Thank you.No. No one that I know of. Well... No. Just how serious is it, doctor? He had fish, too. Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too. He had fish. Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish. Certainly. A hospital? What is it? We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them? Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor? Uh-huh. The gear is down. I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud. Ted... But Ted, you're the only... What happened, Ted? What went wrong? It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts. Sluggish. Like a wet sponge. And a little ice! Rain. Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane! Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war. What's his problem? Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately. Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful? It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news? You got a telegram from headï¿½quarters today. But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past! Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us. I remember everything. All I have are memories. I love you. Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much. What's the matter? You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now. Ted, what are you doing here? It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry. It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility. Your war record ? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history. Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing? I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run. It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect! I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that. I just don't want to go over it any more. Ted! I think so, but I've never seen it so acute. Who wants to be first? We'd better get back now. We have a visitor.Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling. Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill. Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time. Every day. Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.Oh, I'd love to. I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar! Hi!Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why? Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please? I will, but Jim won't.Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here. Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there. Something about a plane with no pilot? Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there. Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up. Oh, I can't stand it. Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped. Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.Of course. Oh yes, I saw. Poor child. Yes?Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment. Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful. I've always thought that myself. And here is one of Frederick's mother. Oh? One or two? Mr. Merrick, sugar? Oh Frederick. Frederick, just what is it that you are saying? Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you. Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you? ...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening. More romances for John? Dinner will be served, shortly, dear. And here are my mother and father. Do you? Well, these things take time. I'm sure I don't know, Freddie. Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess? Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case? But I thought you said that he was rather... simple? What do you mean? Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged. Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now? Did it go well, darling? You won't be long?Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits. O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies. Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me". Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.Welcome home, John. Well... A dressing bag? Very smart indeed. Yes sir. What's that? Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick. I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it. But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends. I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir. Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you. Watery headed bunch. Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here. Good Lord, Mr. Treves! Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir. Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it. Won't come out, eh? Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten? The workhouse. Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in? I've heard. Fine.Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick. The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this? What's this? It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all. The hallway? Oh, the wastecan! Where did you get this box? But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good. What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right. Good morning, Mr. Merrick. Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now. Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?None of your fuckin' business. You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out. Where you going at this hour? Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait. Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here. It's not done.Can't you get the money from your friends? Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?! But they don't have a case against you. What are you doing? All right, just don't make any noise. The kids are sleeping. Are you drunk? I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind. I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids. No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me. No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out. I'm leaving you Jake. Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry. Why don't you just call him? I don't know. No, not that. Why don't you just call him up? I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack. Jake -- Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest. You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me? You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal. You're rotten. Rotten. Rotten. You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital. Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me. Kill me. I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal. You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it. Yeah, I sucked his cock. I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock! Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it. I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there. Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks. Jake, no -- I am answering... What're you talking about? Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything? "Father of the Bride." I went to the movies. I got bored so I went to the movies. I took the kids to my sister's. I went out. What's the matter with you? Jake... But Jake... I didn't say anything... You're hurting my arm. All I did... What did I do? Positive. I never noticed his face. What did I say? Nobody. I love you, remember? Yeah, what? Yeah. What? Jake, c'mon now. Don't start. No, I'm not. I'm not interested in him. No, I'm not. I'm looking at you. I was just... But, Jake, I was just... Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should... Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking... Oh, Jake. I like the gym smell. Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited. Jake... You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks... You said never to touch you before a fight. Are you sure we should be doing this? Jake... Jake, this is your father's bedroom. What does that mean? Can you see it? I can't find my ball. Should I hit it? It feels real good. You go first. Let me watch how to do this. I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school. You don't talk very much. I don't know. 'Cause you're cute. I just wanted to say hello. And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong. That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him. You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared. Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time. I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time? What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she? What do you mean &quot;our&quot;? Ha ha, you have been treating. I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating. No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can-- Then you knew of the inheritance? So--friendly or otherwise--? Gosh, you had me fooled. Okay--I'll be here at eight. Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news. He hardly knew of them him- self. I believe it was his uncle in Australia. He's inherited a fortune. It is--you know what a struggle he's had. You mean he doesn't work for you? I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--. How? What can I do? You can't double-cross me like that. You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power. I'm going to call the police. Dr. Meirschultz, please.I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night. It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later. Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.Great. Sit down. Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes. Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some? Well how can I repay you?Oh! Danny! Danny, come here! Danny. Danny, stop it. Danny! Are you having a bad dream? Danny... what's the matter, hon? Danny? If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves. That's all there is to it. Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay? Well all right. But really don't make a sound. Come on, Doc. He only went to bed a few hours ago. Can't you wait till later? Not right now, Daddy's asleep. Yes? I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you? It's so pretty. Oh what a Maze. Isn't it beautiful. Give me your hand. Oh, isn't it beautiful. Okay Danny, you win. Let's take the rest of this walking, huh? And you're gonna lose. And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right? The loser has to keep American clean, how's that? Okay. You behave yourself. Danny, come on over here. Jack... Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound? We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay? We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay? What about Tony? He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet. Yeah, I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends. Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun. Yeah. Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night. And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm. Ah he dislocated his shoulder. No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school. Tony. Only about three months. Eh we're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there. But eh what was the matter with him? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him. Please... Shall we go into the living room? Sound good to you, Danny? No, we don't mind. Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that? Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now. I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did. God. This is the kitchen, huh? I'm a Wendy. Nice to meet you. I'm gonna go now. I'll bring back a doctor. Go away. Go away. Go away from me. Get down. Jack, stay away from me! Stay away from me. Stay... stay away! Stop it! Stay away from me. Stay away from me! Please... Stay away from me! Stay away from me! Stay away...! Stay away from me, Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! I just want to go back to my room. Stay away from me! Oh Jack, what are you talking about? Of course I am. Jack... Yes... Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor. I don't know. I can't really remember. I... Jack! Jack... Yes. Yes. Somebody did that to him. He's still asleep. And you didn't see anything at all? You went into the room Danny said - to 237? Did you find anything? No. It's the truth, really. I swear it. Danny told me. He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub. She tried to strangle him. It's okay. It's okay, now. Really. Yes. Yes. Okay. I understand. I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then. Ah, come on hon. Don't be so grouchy. Yeah. It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place. I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey. It's really nice up here, isn't it? Well, something'll come. It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day. Any ideas yet? It's really pretty outside. How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast? I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up. I guess we've been staying up too late. It's about eleven thirty. Good Morning, hon. Your breakfast is ready. Yeah. God, I've never seen anything like this before. Are all of these Indian designs authentic? Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different. Hi, hon. How's it going? Just like a ghost ship, huh? It's amazing how much activity is going on today. Hi. Thanks. Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon? Oh, I'll say. Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors. Oh! Royalty? Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen. Oh, it's beautiful. My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?Good. My heart can't take it. I like trees. I wouldn't know. I've never had one. Look at this! Snow. Ice. Your idea of a good time. You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really. A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex. C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ? There is some good in you, Lex, after all. Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis? That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . . Wrong. It's beautiful. No, me, me, me. Thank you. Genius! -- Lex. This way Lex. Why am I doing this? Why am I here?And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you? Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton. Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility -- You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to -- You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest. Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream. The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that - The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question. And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity. The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty - For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals." -- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.Everything on it. Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go -- Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know. Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not. . . . Superman?. . . . . I'm fine. . . . . . What was I talking about? Before? See what happens when I don't have my orange juice? The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ---- . . . gee . . . Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . . . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that. Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me. Oh, I'm not blaming you. I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity. Some rival, huh? Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick. Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do. Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . " I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying? Never closed my eyes. Oh, hi. Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . . But what can you do? There's no way now . . . I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with. Let's get you inside . . . . Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . . You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say. Your place? Maybe I should change, Maybe you should, too. I want to. "What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk? I'm listening. I'm in love with you. How do you feel? Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . . Maybe you wanted to. I was right. you are Superman. It's true. It's true. Oh Clark, no! Because of what I'm betting. My life. Uh-uh. Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it? Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool -- Don't fake me out, Clark. Or whoever you are. And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that? I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear. Where were you? Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold. Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry. Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry. That's because you can hardly see through those things. Mr. Smith - -- the "complimentary couch." Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill. Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls. I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter - -- uh, reporters -- on this. Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes. Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers. In July??? Of course, that's what friends are for. Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care? Be my guest. Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis. No, this was good enough for my mother -- Well, you shouldn't Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do. Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you. Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism? Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you. Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills. No, this is -- -- natural. Well, you never will again! Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day. When was the last time you heard me sneeze? Do I detect a note of jealousy? Then maybe you should get your glasses checked. But him is you. Now I'm confused. It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent. Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it. Like it? It's magnificent! Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time. I must be. But I'm not. Your home. This is your home. The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its -- Superman! The --"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
