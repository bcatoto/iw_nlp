...Tonight! My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night! Shush. It's only been a day. And it's seemed like forever. This night is too beautiful to have again. You scare me. Nor I! I... accept your proposal! Did it work? You've been here before? You are. And I'll come again. Thank you for inviting. It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long. Wake up, William. Wake up! And I with you. But you must wake. Yes, you are. And you must wake.Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui? A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did. Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for. Last night I slept with a member of the War Council. When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love. I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people. I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace. When will his trial be? Is it true? Wallace is captured? Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush. Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way. I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion. Good day to you, M'Lords. Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord. No, M'lord. ...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand -- Scotland. He intends -- You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended. He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them. I have faced him. Have you? Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule. No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war. Humbly, M'lord. ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord. He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him. No. He did not. Shall I leave, M'lord? Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead. ...I wouldn't know. This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman? He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed. How do you know this? I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it! Drink this! It will dull your pain. You will die! It will be awful! Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live. Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy. No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you? You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king? I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises. Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met. It does me good to see you. I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman. Peace is made is such ways. Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally. That is not possible. Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin? I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight. But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman? I come as the king's servant, and with his authority. I am the Princess of Wales.He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday. No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script. Murray's dead. You seem to feel fine about it. What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you. I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late. I miss Murray, Harry. What a spectacular view. Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like? Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.What took you so long? Go get your stuff. You don't act like it? Were you scared up there? Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry... Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake. You're as bad as Harry... Are you going down? He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV. Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital. Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu. Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu. Harry... My God... Hey, Chili? Look at me. Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow. No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general. I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it. Really. Yeah? How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure. So what about your story. You thought of a title yet? For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then. You don't like Martin much, do you? Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why? Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number. That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it. A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid. Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy. You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant. And you think the movie business is any different? Yesterday, you were a loan shark. I want to know. What do you get out of it? I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin. You and Harry'll make a great team. I'm gonna make a deal with him. Then you've read it? I think it's not horrible. I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house. I just caught the end. Right. See how your story ends. Don't go out of your way. Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out. Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help. He must mean after "Slime Creature 3". I married Martin. That was a full- time job. Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...' Yeah. It's a real gift. I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..." I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream. Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie. You saw that one? ...That's what we finally decided. I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons �- Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out. Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before? What're you doing here? How much is the wife offered? A real bargain. But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year. The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand? I know what a vig is. What if it was? You broke in? Harry -� Chili and me. Harry, we spoke with Martin. Harry, what're you still doing with those guys? What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house. Well. I got an audition tomorrow. With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry? That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy. Maybe you didn't hear me. How did you get in the house? Harry -� Harry, are you going down, or you want me to? I don't have a dog. When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through. Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room. Be quiet and listen. And after all, you have such morals. Thanks. But you are interested? Lufkin. His... agent. Oh, for Christ's sake �- 'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party. Really. Hello, Martin.He's in the bathroom. We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were -- Kara? ... No, this is Beth. You mean Tommy. Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven. Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid. Messed up his head. He's harmless, though. Probably just lonely. Why? You interested? Pig. What the hell happened this time? He do that to you? What if it's Kara? Aren't you gonna answer that? What if your parents come home? Guess they -- went to the fair after all. We can light our own tree at home. Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here. Jesus, that's my neighbor. Tommy. Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something! Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work. Reality check, dillweed. This is 1995. Hold on, hot lips. We got work to do.You knew, didn't you, John? You knew. I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with. John, I want you to come with us. John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her! He told me about the terrible things that happened here. In our house. A man came by the house. A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis. You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara. Relax, John. They were just kids. God ... this can't be true. What should I do? Jamie? But I thought she was -- What makes you think he'll come here again? Who are you?Do you care about me? I don't want you to hurt me. Nothing? But I'm scared Telly. How do you know? I'm nervous. I like you too. Come on. Uh huh. Yes. Yeah? I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight. Tonight? I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me. No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends. I thought you had a girlfriend. You were? At the block party? You have? Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps. Hold on. Right now? I was just getting ready to take a bath. Hey.Do you care about me? But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us. I wouldn't believe it? Why is that? Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby. Because, you know why. You know. You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me. Yeah.Casper, where is he? Casper, where's Telly. Casper. No... No, Fidget, I... What is it? Who are they? Fine Fidget. What's all this? Telly is at Steven's? I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere? What? But I only had sex with Telly. I tested positive? What? No. One. 15. Your a real philosopher. What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart? Yeah? Thanks. Yeah? No. No. Yeah, I guess so. Everything is wrong. Sorry. Yeah well, it's been a bad day. Yeah. No. I'm OK. Thanks. What? I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly? It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there. Hello Paul. Is Telly inside? No. I just gotta go find him. I gotta find him. I gotta go. I gotta find Telly. I only did it once and... That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore. Good luck. Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it. And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging. I hate sucking dick! Mine are like my neck and my chest. Like where are your erogenous zones? Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know. Passion... Foreplay. Foreplay. No, I didn't bleed. I didn't bleed. I know. And you feel like you're being ripped open inside. Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?! I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick. Who, Benny's little sister? Do you know where he went? What happened? Yeah. Have you seen Telly around? Just a lot of crazy shit.And you don't get shit out of it. Because he can like climax you up to that... That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex. Yep. Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex. Did they ask you a lot of questions? Yeah. Yeah. I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards. Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored. Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes. But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?! Oh shit. Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds! Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring. You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww. Yeah. Sweet. Yep. Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name. Four-thirty in the morning? When are you gonna be back? Shh. That's right. Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job. Hi Telly. Where you been?Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night. Yes! Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't. Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure. Yes. With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three. Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine. Umm. Altogether? 17. I'm coming. Don't go anywhere. Stay with me. Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out. Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK. Wish me luck. And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know. Yeah. And then it hits that little thing. That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever. Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear. Mine? Hell yeah, they don't know. Boom!!! Boom!!! Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like... Hell yeah. I love. I love sex. You didn't? Did you bleed? You are being ripped open. The pain. The fucking pain! You still mad at him? Telly says was up. I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone. And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie. And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe. I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative. Yeah I get bored. Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep. Yeah it's the biggest disappointment! Yep. And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there... It's really slow. It's slow boring. Yeah. It's like... Making love is like. Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking! You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting. No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something. It was... it was. To come? He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard. And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard... It's very monotonous. It's grandmother style. That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.Have you ever swallowed it before? Yep. I was like yes! I'm going out with him! You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown. You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you? It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh. Yeah. It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter. Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half. Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever Yeah. Right. Yeah. Slow. First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.I guess so. Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance. Come dance. Dance!Yes. Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale. There are limits. One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me. And do what... rot away in a room? We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel. I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch? Let's stay for a while. Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her. Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean. Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening. Shall we go away for a couple of days? I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful. They wouldn't know. Do you want me not to go tonight? Yes... I'll give you that. I don't understand any of that. What was that all about? Your color. Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers. Be careful. Here's my speech... ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us. You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed. I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again. I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out. Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling. How are you doing? I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly. Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight. Tomorrow night as a matter of fact. I am planning to go out and do some work. Then come. I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour. Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours. Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth. Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes? Whatever that means. Open your presents. Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job. I know that... No? Well... OK... Why? OK. Ben? Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord. Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you. I do. I really do. OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in. What? Don't you like me, Ben? That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff? So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans. So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now! Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life. What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck! There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room. Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel? It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss. Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place. Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas? I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean... Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you. It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision. Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself? First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself? Very clever. Yes. I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later. The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk? I like hearing you talk. If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you? Thank you. What time is it? You OK? You OK out there? We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one. I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait. No, I can't have dinner with you. Are you serious. What's up? Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep? No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car? Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury? How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death? To death? What's the story? Are you too drunk to come? OK... whatever. Do you want to fuck now? A shot of tequila, if you can spare it. Mind if I use the bathroom? You were going to get my door. I sometimes fade out. I guess I do too. Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time. No, this is fine. I was just wondering. I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel? No -- S.E.R.A. You're pretty drunk. Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk. Isn't it illegal to drink and drive? Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking. Hello. Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again. I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood. Well... I thought you might be looking for a date. Where are you staying? So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous? Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention? Yuri... are you... No. It's me, Yuri. Don't hit me. Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score. It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks. Yes, of course. How much do you need? Where have you been staying? I am lonely, Yuri. I've been all right. Please, Yuri. I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only. Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention. General Bonaparte? To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure. I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose. Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill. Lisette La Croix. Lisette. Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice. Do you have three francs, sir? Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir? Is it a nice warm room, sir? Are you staying with a friend, sir? One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir? Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me. Yes, I am, sir. Yes, it must be. The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir? Good evening, sir.Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness. Ah, that is good. Oh... I see. I understand. How is... the Emperor? Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last. I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress. Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging. He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins. Oh, my darling. I'm sorry, too. I won't do that again -- whatever you do. I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise. Who is it? In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream. But you will not... be safe... Separate bedrooms? Five minutes. Five minutes. Will you be joining us, soon? What are you doing in there? Where is Madame Trillaud? I know what you're doing in there. Open the door. It's me. You are my old friend. Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway. Promise. I don't care, but promise you will never leave me. Promise me. Promise me you will never leave me. She must have been in love with you. Were any of them married? Were any of them prettier than I am? Were they pretty? Were you in love with any of them? But you have had mistresses while you were away. And you, are you in love with any one else? Yes. Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me. I thought I was. I was confused. Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be! Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you? Yes, I'm afraid he is. I believe he is riding. I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you. Yes, of course. Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry? Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here. May I offer you a drink? Oh... yes, of course! Have you met my daughter, Hortense? Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte. One has read so much about you lately. Please sit down.No. Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me. Oh, no, I am very happy. But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know. And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender. Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here? I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much. I hope you have patience with me. I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn. I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views. I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside. You are so good to me. Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden? Will I be able to play the harp? It is an instrument of which I am very fond. Do you like music? You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures. And, where did you see my portrait? Oh, then you are...You sent my assistant on an errand. But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you? All right, I'll do it. Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies. Nothing. I broke a lamp. Don't remind me. What's he doing here? Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech. Good luck. Of course. I'll get a car to drive you. For not believing you. I would also like to apologize. I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene. Indeed. I love it when pistolero's talk of trust. I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech. I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect? What the hell are you saying? What? Who did? You shot her? How do you know that? You were very nervous. I remember you...in the elevator. Ah. That's...a comfort to hear. One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over. My security people are right next door. Of course. I wish everything were that easy. Yes? You were saying? Your daughter....? What can I do for you Mr....Watson?I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor. I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager. I think you're right. Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me. I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him. We will. He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute. It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances. I don't know. I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked. All right, let's just...let's get security in on this. Yes, you're right, I don't understand. Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant. Is that something precious? It looks real. I don't know anything about guns. He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a He brought a gun onto the pool deck.No, kisses to... No...kisses to you. I promise. All right. To be a hero? Can we go now? I'm tired. I want to.go now. He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out". I can hear you good. Can you hear me? Right. Nods. No way. On TV. Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh. A surprise? Why? I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby. I'm not a baby. Where are we going? Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home. I've done much better ones than this. My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers? Laughs. Everybody does? You stole that.Fuck you! Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here! You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that! Hey! Fuckin' A. I don't have to pay you nothin'. For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here! No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here. I don't want my windshield cleaned. You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not? I've got something for you. Close your eyes. You're a big girl, huh? Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all. That's good. That's good, sweetie pie. You have, huh? That's pretty good. He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero. It goes in that little hole. This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack! Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out. Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that? No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference. What gives? Yeah. Yeah. 'Daddy has to go now. Go ahead, sugar Die. Only you. I kill her anyway. Come with me, honey. Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they? Young love. Where? What about them? Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em. That one.Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard. Strength in this life. Happiness in the next. It's meant to make us stronger. Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur. God has chosen thee to survive ... It's a gift, Richard. This law school is a gift from your brother. Thou must. We haven't said grace yet. Richard. Then this shall be our little secret. Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees. Thou may fool the world. Even thy father. But not me, Richard. Never me. I expect more from thee, Richard. So am I. Thy father will have to know of thy lying. I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we? Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning. Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse. Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him. Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example. Richard ... come with me, would you ...Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard. Remember -- listen up! Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration. Check yourselves. Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys. We rendezvous where? The Watergate, Room 214. When? At zero three-hundred. "A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche. Howard ... What the hell? What're you doing?There'll be time for that. It'll be over soon. No. They're not yours. They are you. You should burn them. And what would I find out that I haven't known for years. What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world. I remember Alger Hiss. I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything. But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them. Because you have absolutely no remorse. No concept of remorse. You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ... You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you? Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick? Sex? Your secrets, your fantasies? Or just me and you and ... What matters to me is whether you understand it. Why didn't you? Thank you? Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you. No, it isn't. I won't interfere with you anymore. I'm finished trying. I'm the only left, Dick. If you don't talk to me, you ... Whatever it is you've always been hiding. You're letting it destroy you, Dick. You won't even ask for help. You're destroying yourself, Dick. I wish I knew. You're hiding. You. What' you're doing -- Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling. But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him? When? It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him. Congratulations, Dick. You're a long way from Whittier. Penny for your thoughts. But they never will, Dick. No matter how many elections you win, they never will. Sometimes I think that's what you want. You personally? They're all your enemies? Then what are you scared of, honey? No, you're not. So stop comparing yourself to him. You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it. Why can't you just enjoy it? Yes, it's been a long time ... I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick? Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys? You didn't want to let me out of your sight. Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together? Just the two of us. I've missed you. He looked old, didn't he? Will you ... would you kiss me? Can I just ask for one thing? Then I'll be there for you. And then you'll be happy? Do you really want this, Dick? I don't want them to love me. You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they? New Hampshire ... Were you planning to tell me? They've lost a brother. You know what that means, Dick. Then call him. I'm sure it was an oversight. You don't have to go. Dick, you should call Bobby. Is that the truth? Are you serious? We can be happy. We really can. We love you, Dick. The girls and I... Dick, don't... That's what you said the first time we met. You didn't even know me. No, I'm not! I'm finished. You're ruining us. If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you. This isn't political, Dick. This is our life. The girls will grow up. They only know you from television anyway. I want a divorce. Not that. Us. It's over, Dick. No. I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again. I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you. You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you? You're not a failure, Dick. It is. We know that. And it's enough that we know. Just think of the girls. They're still young. We never see them. I lost my parents. I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ... We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick. It makes us human ... I know ...Yeah, she lives in Dallas ... ... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ... Elvis I like, too. I like jazz ... Oh, I like satin, I like pink ... Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome. Hi.It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal. Then what's the point? What's the point of being president? You're powerless. Someone wants it ... You can't stop it, can you? Even if you wanted to. Because it's not you. It's the system. And the system won't let you stop it ... No, we don't! You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you? My brother died over there last November. Why? What good was his death? We didn't come here to talk about football. We came here to end the war.No... Fuck that, we've got company... Those ain't cops. I'm okay... listen to me... Let's go with Judge, check it out. Tyrone... Little Bobby... Just a kid... But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either! What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!You believe that? I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God. You meet those friends of yours in jail too? Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison. I saw. I saw that big one hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too. They take you to jail? You don't look alright.You know it. Stay Black... Well don't go forgetting your friends. Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us? Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!! Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now. No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger. Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back. Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know? Ain't no one seen him. It was Sabu killed Cy. Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck... Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum? This cool the heat off you any? Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but... Funny you don't look like church folk to me. You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?I live for the moment. Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party. Fuck you. He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone. You said you were going to get her out of this. I made my choice, Lenny. Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news. An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris? You're too goddamned paranoid. Leave him alone, Tran. We have nothing to talk about, Lenny. 'We might as well make the best of it.' Uh huh. And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me. I acquired the taste from Lenny.' I know. I don't always do exactly what I'm told. So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?' And you said -- come on Max. My God. Jesus. You can't just... kill him. What're you going to do? Oh my God. I don't believe this is happening. What a nightmare. You think Tran killed her? So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do. We should talk alone. Oh God, Lenny. I was trying to keep you out of this. What's going on? You don't know what you're fucking with here. Then what? Then what, Lenny?! You going to protect me? Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny. You don't even have a gun. Who did it? You're crazier than I thought, Lenny. Coming here... Tran's just in there. You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat? Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over. It's over! Now please leave. I have to go on again in a couple of minutes. Yeah, for about a month now. Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay? And stay away from me. Stop trying to rescue me. Those days are over. I'm a big girl now. Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me. You have to get out of here. If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy. He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid. He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around. Damn right. Maybe. He has his uses too. That's a good one, coming from you. Let it alone, Lenny. It'll take care of itself. Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head. You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you? You talked to Iris? When? You have to go. I mean it. I know. Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you. No, Lenny. I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny. Cut it out, Tran. Make me forget it, baby. I don't feel anything. Is it on? I feel like you're turning me into a VCR. Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?Yeah. See you there. Well... Get going. You're still bleeding. Hey, Lenny. We made it. Are we under arrest? Yeah, right. Fucked. Oh boy. What if you're wrong? A cop? You want me to trust a cop?! That's the original. There are no copies. And do what? Take on his whole posse? Uh unh. No. They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake. Good, Lenny. I can see why the detective gig didn't work out. Come on. No, it's not. You never told me. No. It didn't. I guess. Yeah. Lenny. I have. Lenny... shutup. Just park your mouth and listen. It's a set-up. Think about it! Why's he been sending you tapes? To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion. This guy's bent enough to think of that. I'm not going. Why didn't he just go public with the tape? Save himself that way. Who's Strickland? The only card we have to play is the tape. You know, we get it to the media somehow... How long does it last? Oh. Why? I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops. Yeah. You gave up your hot tub tape to save me. That's real progress for you. Well, look at the plus side. People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One. Jesus. Maybe they ought to see. You know what this tape could do if it gets out. I see. I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all. Uh unh. I won't do it. Tell me. You sure? I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape. Fire's out, isn't it? This is bad. It's okay, Lenny They'd never get here in time anyway. Lenny. Calm down. This is what I do. Take it easy. The glass is bullet resistant. Lenny, give them the tape. Something in your car... Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said. Lenny, have you lost it completely? You better keep a low profile for a while. Will you relax. There's nobody back there. What is it? Where we going? Whatup Lenny? I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier. I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway. I'm sorry. OK. He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him. Sure. Now you're really getting paranoid. That's where it gets a little strange. Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up. But why not just put a little lead in her ear? So the guy's not a sicko. Because Iris knew somebody was after her. But that doesn't add, does it. It's not your fault. No more, Lenny. Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself. So that gives you something. You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot? So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around-- This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts. Cause you're the man, right? The Magic Man. If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach. And gives it to you. Are you sure it's real? Blackjack? I don't understand-- My God, Lenny. What is it? What is it? What's that? Present from Faith? What I'm saying. But you still come out this goofball romantic. You're some piece of work, you know that. Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all. Destiny? You living in a perfume commercial? She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride. She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit. Trust me on this. Forget her. Guy named Wade Beemer. Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97. Sure, Lenny. The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love. Jesus, Lenny. Yeah. I don't see a way out of it. Look, I gotta get some sleep. Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life. You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next. And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it. Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer. No, you're just trying to get off. No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another. You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act. Well I'm out. I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here. I've had it. No more wirehead shit in my car. You understand? You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else. Get it. I've had enough of this shit. You're on foot, Lenny. Are we having a bad night? You will not live to see the morning. What the fuck are you doing? Fumitsu. Define love. Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months. Lenny, this shit's illegal. Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig. Uh huh, I wanna hear this part. Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs. So, what's up with you? Another busy night selling porno to wireheads? Driving Mr. Lenny. Jeez, you're pathetic. Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James. I'll take you there, you can get a cab. Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends. Excuse me. What part of NO don't you understand? Sleaze to peddle. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds. I've already pulled twelve hours today. Greetings, gents. So let's hear this week's sad story. We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there. Let's go. Chop chop. Well give me some then... I'm starving. What is that? Are you going to make me beg? Just Lenny. Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war! So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen? It happened! The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America! Who the fuck are you to bury this?! This seems a little sophisticated for them. These are not subtle guys. Take the tape to the cops. Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created. It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now? But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- Hey, isn't that Tran Vo? No. I haven't noticed because I make my payments. So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?Oh, God. I see it! Was nice. What? Okay. Right. Shit. What? Martin. I know. That's why I'm attracted to you. I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating. Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you. That doesn't sound normal. Maybe you should see a psychiatrist. Uh-huh. When did it start? Were you attracted to me right away? Is this becoming complicated? Was she the only one? Did you -- What happened to her? Who was she? It happened to you before? Attraction is a complication? Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before? Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing? Why? Are you attracted to me? Am I attractive? Can I ask you something? I'm playing white, remember. You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way. Why? What? He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl. I watched my parents have this big fight, really big. I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up. And I watched them make love through the keyhole. He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation. So I could watch the girl that lived under me. I don't know. When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor. I know. It makes me crazy. No? Isn't it interesting though? I mean, look at us, in this room. Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market. I mean, we look like just another couple. But what are we? Doesn't it seem so crazy? She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older. She has four kids. The young guy works for her. And I think she likes kinky sex. I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them. I wanted to, so I did. Nobody ever sees me. It was no big deal. I saw them leave, I went in. I went into their room this afternoon. When I first saw them I thought they were married. Did you think they were newlyweds? So? I hate bishops. They're useless. I like knights. I think I got one today. Do you have ulcers? Ten years later, here you are again. You didn't take it. Was that it? What did he want? What happened? Ten years ago. I don't believe that. What is it? I don't like this at all. What is going on here? You killed him here? In this city, outside that bank? For Nicholai? You can't know for sure, how can you? I mean, you're not him. Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel. Except -- Sounds pretty well figured out. We split the money? You'll have the money. How do I know that you won't -- And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank. That means you won't have a gun. What? What if he brings it with him? Why won't he wait until the bank closes? Aiiee. More waiting? I don't know if I like this plan. Okay. Then what? But he won't shoot you right then? Check. Fine. They saw you coming a mile away. If I had known we'd be using -- Cheap as shit. Two way? I've always wanted to learn something like that. Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it. Where did you learn it? The beach? It was nice. Sorry. Book. Sunglasses. Great. Really? I know what you are thinking. I'm not going to disappear, okay? I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach. I got to get out of this room, just for a little while. Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here. What do you think he's doing? In Costa Blanca. Do you think he's here? I'm kind of tired. I think I'd like to try and get some sleep. That sounds nice. What will you do if this works, if we get the money? What happens if you do? Not even a stalemate? But you've never figured out a way to win. Do you think about the game? Oh. What do you think about? Why not? What? You were there? I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico. Is it as nice as they say? About? Hey, where are you? Where is it? Several. You said you didn't trust it. No. Something honest. Does that mean it didn't bother you? That's fiction. Did it ever bother you? After that? Are they usually like that? Because I want to know. Yes. Tell me about the first time. Then you went freelance? They tried to kill you? Why did you leave the Agency? Why? Why not? The exotic women. Ahhhh... But you knew what they were training you for? They didn't give you a choice, did they? You went from high school to the Agency? Why not? You were like a boy genius? Jesus -- why? How old were you? The C.I.A.? How did you get into the business? Where you wanted to be? Why? He was killed. Why didn't you finish this game? It looks like white's game. Had? Better than playing with yourself. With computers. This is crazy. I can't trust you. You can't trust me. How can we possibly help each other? Why? If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have? What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you. No. Just Electra. Yeah. Electra. Listen -- I don't even know your name. Oh Jesus Jesus... How? You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me. Why? Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door -- I don't need the money. I don't need you to get the money -- my money! I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you. Don't tell me I don't have a choice! Forget it! And you want to use me to get him? Why? He wants to kill you? Why? So this is something between you and him? Someone hired both of you? Who is that other guy? What does that mean? An assassin? You're one of them, aren't you? Nikita? You didn't know anything about me. Okay. How did you find me? You want me to pump? Now what? Ten million -- What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know? You're one of them, aren't you? A fucking pro. Bullshit. Yeah? Who the fuck are you? Who do you work for? What? How did you know I had a cat? Where are we going? Um, five. What? A pleasure doing business with you. I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus. Right. In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night. I thought it was interesting -- I wasn't watching television.Electra -- Jesus! Why didn't you tell me? God damnit, Electra. This is not a game. This is business. The point is, they are paying for information. Real information. Not tooth paste brands. Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper. And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.Did Two-Face call him Bruce? Maybe you just haven't met the right woman... You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip? We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche. My life's an open book. You read? I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask. Now black rubber. What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets. A girl cannot live by psychoses alone. I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional... Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited. He's home. I sent the signal. I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats? Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent. I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table. You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face. _Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist? What are you talking about? What? Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible. You do know. Try. What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say? Stop fighting. Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-. Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something? Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account- Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous. Touchy, touchy. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking. In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow. You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from? Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous... Why do you do that? What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him? Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living. Find anything interesting? And now.... Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay? What? You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too. Well, I met someone... Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy... The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it? I don't get you Bruce Wayne. Like normal folks. I'm surprised you aren't blind by now. Excuse me. Would you? I'm not so sure. That's usually my line. You understand obsession better than you let on. The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be... What do you know about obsession? I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats? Exactly. Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you? My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko. She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams. Need one? The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off? Psychiatrists make you nervous? How can I help you, Mr. Wayne? You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please. Who is The Batman, Edward? Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is. It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me? Edward... Chase?Well, I can help. I don't mind waiting. It's a beautiful picture of her. Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian. Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business -- My Jewish friend's grandmother did. I simply can not stand that tone! You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch! Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white! Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny." Well, that's a long time. Boy. It sure has been a long time. Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts. No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died. Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks? I do not need instructions from you to bathe! I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come! Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed. No treasure maps, huh? How bizarre! Eeeww! I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!No. You can have them. Aw, Betty. No. Oh, just a old letter from a friend. Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this? I know. I don't understand it either. I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids? You're right -- that is sick. -- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin! What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage - Did we want to? Was this during Betty? I never knew that. You never dated Kathy Reynolds! I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy. Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk? You mean -- she didn't like sex? Yeah. But I thought she died. Have you called Betty? Maybe you should. And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things? Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay. I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married. At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry. Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy. STOP IT! I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND! Well, I'd like to read them. What are you doing? "... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..." Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose. But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..." No, I don't think so. I -- I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that? Don't say that! My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny. I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away. '82. That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge. That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is. From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is... I love you... Robert. "-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives -- Come here a minute. Michael. I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died. Well, there's a problem. He's not coming. I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry. Mom's orders.No. What a tragedy. What happened? She used to be so friendly. She's changed. I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh. No, what? Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes." What do you know about "the changes"? Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points. Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing. Not this kind of heat. Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all. No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind? I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down. Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me. Madge? Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to. No. Don't do this. I don't know. Please... I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you. Robert. Please. You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you. We are the choices we've made, Robert. No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake. You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change. No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her? His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids... For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life. No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing. What makes it different, Robert? WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT? WHY? You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony! No one's asking you to! Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time? I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything. You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group. I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning - "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death. Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time. Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand. Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food. To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter? Well, what is this? Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam? Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it? Good. More coffee? Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should. Sleep all right? No. Long day. Go to sleep. Where was she? You're right, you know. We don't have much time. Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this. What? What were your parents like? I just wondered. Why were you trouble? What were you like when you were younger? But you don't mind. Why do you say that? I bet you could do a book. On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling. I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by... Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church? And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it! Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them. I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train. Yes. Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here. Take me somewhere. Are you hungry? No. I can't. Not yet. Yes, that'd be nice. Sure. Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour. Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have? Sorry I'm late. Richard called. I want you to come. I understand. That's very kind of you. I think he's running for town crier next year. Oh. I guess you got the whole story. Oh. Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still... Yeah. See you later. No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there. Oh, sure. Great. Wonderful. Uh... The light was fading. Huh-huh. No. I was just... No. Yes! Hi. ... I feel like something's been spoiled now. Listen, I'm sorry I -- I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something. What made you ask such a question? Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world. No, I'm just saying -- But it's not the same. But no one in particular. But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people? Do you ever regret not having a family? Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean. Why doesn't it scare you? You really don't need anyone? Woman friends, too? You must get lonely at times. So what happened? Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced? What? Yes. What? No. I'll do them later. Umm, I don't know. I can look it up. What? No. I'm all right. It's working. When? Smells like dirt. You drink bug repellent? Well, it's kind of buggy out there. My God. How I'd love to see that. No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere. I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it. My children. And Richard didn't like my working. I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school. I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I don't think you're normal. You sound like an artist. Why, do you think? "Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you? You ought to write these stories down. Oh you! Then what happened? Oh my God... You're blushing. What? Okay. Help cook? Would you like to stay for dinner? There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I. But I... We don't even know each other. I feel so embarrassed. I think so. Much. Yes. Very clean. No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father. He's very... clean. Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard. Why? I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens. Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16. About a year and a half. My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer. And how long are you here for? Where are you staying while you're here? I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason. Not at all. Lemon? Francesca. Sure. Oh, that's nice. Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection. No, I'm not. I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just... Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts. No, not at all -- except those are poisonous. Oh there you are. This time of year. I don't mind waiting. Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there? You just... got off the train because it looked pretty? No, really? Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari. No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy. Uh... uh... Umm... long time. Oh. Oh. When did you move back? Are you from Washington originally? Maybe it's because I live here. No. Hmm-mmm. No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait. I just have to get my shoes. Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here. Roseman Bridge? Are you supposed to be in Iowa? I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills. I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me. Yes. And I've accepted. Hmm? Okay. Want anything special for dinner? It's only four days. I'm positive. "I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten." I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too! I can't sleep. I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt. Later. Go back to sleep. Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up. I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache. It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day. Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think. Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us! Well, what's nice about her? Tell us! What's she like? What's her name? Are you seeing Betty tonight? Yes, they are. About an hour ago. Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go? What happened?She changed. My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one. Oh, yes. I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing. See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well. Mrs. Delaney. Did you hear the latest?Oh, that'll be nice. No, of course not. I'll just clean up. You want me to call the doctor? Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am. Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said - "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious? He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.They're not going to find her! I don't remember! I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca! Oh my God...!I don't know. I don't know. Oh, no, please, please. Mommy. Dad! I can't! I'm tied! Help, Daddy! Okay. You shut up. I don't want to go to Europe. I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.Long suspected of running the Tangiers without... ...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave. In a Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license denial, Rothstein followed several... ...and hypocrisy. ...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption. Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor. What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, SamBut it was just mine. I am calm! You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me! Let me in the house! Fucker! Oh, you are... What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal! Not gonna let me in? You are not threatening me anymore! Don't you threaten me! Don't you threaten me! I am not! You come out here and talk to me, you fucker! Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker! You get down here! Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! Fuck you! So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh? I wouldn't - I wouldn't do that... I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you. I want you to let me go. I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go. I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay? Why don't you just let me go, Sam? I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up. Fuck you. Oh, sh- I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up. She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while. It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there. Oh... Hi, Sam. I can back him off. I was with somebody. All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer. Fine. Just gonna get the bowl for my thing. Why do you want to do that? She had the same. I had a... salad. To the Riviera. With Jennifer. Oscar wants you to call him. Oh. I got your cigarettes. Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore. Where's Amy? I threw it away. I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you! I am. I'm wakin' her up right now. Fine. I'm takin' Amy. Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase! And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it. I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too! Fuck you! And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street. The arrangement is over! I'll go, but I want my money right now! Let go of me! Let go of me! Get off of me! Stop it! Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts! There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out. Would you knock it off, Sam? Yeah. Yeah. I bought him a watch too. Mm-hm. He wanted a watch, too. He needed some clothes. With what? Okay? Yeah, yeah, I got the rest. Yeah. It's, uh, it's under twenty-five. Pretty serious. ...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money. I gotta tell ya... I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up. Right. What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me? Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself. Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right? Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out. We had a deal. Remember that? He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave. Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow. Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay. Okay... I'll try. I'll try. No, you don't. That's all you care about. You don't care about me at all. I don't need one. Okay, okay. Okay. You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here. I am. I said, you can't make me stop caring about people. You can't make me stop caring... I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy! You didn't have to beat him up! I didn't take your pills. Huh? No, he didn't. You can trust me. Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad? Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this. No. I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal. Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself. Well, what's the difference? I just need it. Yeah. Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand. You get her? Okay. Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual. Oh, fabulous. Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much. Put your arm in there. Hi. Nice to see you. Need a little help with that, Mr Collins? Okay. Come on. Can I keep this one in the house? You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either. So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day? Oh... Oh, it's so soft. You're kidding? My God. What is it? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay. I just - You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just... I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay? I'm not crying. Yeah. What're you... what're you pitching me, here? If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me? Understand? I'm sorry. I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you. You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't. You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know? You got the wrong girl, Sam. What, are you trying to handicap me? Good luck. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Hey, Mitch. I hit a few... uh, games on the way back. Hello. Okay, thank you for asking. I'll be right back. I'm going to go powder my nose. You just - Just stop him. No, you can, you can. You've been so nice to me. And here. Here. Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay? Can I go in? Can I go in? Fucker! He won't let me go in my house! I'm just trying to get in my house! He won't let me in my own house! He won't... I'll to the FBI! Go back inside! This is none of your business! I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore. But I'm just trying to leave. What? For what? You fucked with me for the last time! I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore! I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money! Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole! What about my money? Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with. If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him? Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no. Yeah. Uh-huh - Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nicky, please... Yeah. Yeah. I do. I need a new sponsor. I need some help. I do. I need some help. You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky. I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do. I'm not as tough as you think I am. He hates my fuckin' guts. Exactly. He hates me. No, he's not. Sure did. 'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do. I did what you told me to. Exactly. I didn't. I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back. He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me. He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass. Yeah. 'Cause, you know, He's never gonna give me my jewelry. Mm-hm. Okay. Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank... could help me get my jewelry out? There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out. Yeah? I don't - Nothin'. Oh, you're right, I know. It's... well, I was just - Bye. So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right? Yeah, uh-huh... Okay. No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me. Thank you. Thanks. You're so nice. Oh, come on. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. He gives a fuck what I do? He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about? He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him. I do. I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality. Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake. I mean it. I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. Mm, you want to steal it? So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry. Am I right? Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right? You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end. Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what? No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise. Yeah, no shit. Tell me. Hi, how are you? Hi, Jennifer. But I saw something... You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go? I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein. Well, how 'bout that? Get lost? Get lost? What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you. Don't give me that shit. I want my money. What money? Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end. What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut. Come on. Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I told you I was hot tonight. Yes! You're driving me nuts! No, I'm gonna drive. Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car. Go! Go! Get in the car! Go! Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now? Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go! What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house! That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's - So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now. He called you right here. Here. Lester - he called you here. We'll go later. It means I got the money. Uh, talk to you later. Bye. Okay, then. You do? Promise? Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now. No, Lester. I love you. I am. I'm always here for you. I'm here. Yeah. All right.Hello. Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera? You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis. Good to meet you. All right, we're clear. Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful. You go and put your things away. Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please? ...same outfit. Well, you know... Great. Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it. So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway? Incredible. Wow. Hey, how you doin'? Look, there aren't... There aren't but... God, I'm telling you, they're out! I think that's it. Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!'Cause it clogs up your heart. Yeah. Mm-hm. Two.Then do it the way you want. You are right. What can I... You'll get a heart attack like that. Take it easy, though. I know it, I know it. I know, but that's enough. All right, take it easy now, take it easy. That's enough. Again! There's a lot of people here. Since when do you talk like that? What's the matter with you? Hey! Oh!Artie! Artie! No, I won't calm down! He's my husband! Artie!Where have you been ? What happened to your wallet? You bastard! Stop acting like a silly little fag! You've got a date right here , Andy. This has got to... You're fired. Oh, God, I forget. Yes. Yes. You go. Poor thing, you ought to get out. Get out! All of you! None of you know anything about it. Now go. And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them. I can't, Andy. About what? Reminded me that I used to be attractive. That men used to want me... I want to die. Oh, God. I must have looked horrible. But earlier, he was staring up here. Please , Andy. You parked right behind him. The one I noticed earlier. I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look. Andy? Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure? Oh God. I'm really crazy. Andy? When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'. You look under the bad. I'm three years old. Call the prison. He whispered, but it was him ! I know it was him! I had the dream again. And I got another call. This time he spoke. He said "You and me, you and me." I've told you: I can't afford to garage it. I got it myself... I couldn't wait. Where were you? Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right? The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh... Yes. I believed him. When he was seventeen. He told me he had done two others just like it. The first two murders. The same as the first time... He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong. He was not acting on mad impulse. He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time. Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears. Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear. I thought he was lying. He was lying. The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects. Yes. Without question. In jail. How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten? Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten? I think whatever is best for you, Daryll. And maybe you're right, that's the place. I don't know. I'd like to know where he is. Ah ha. What did he want? I will. I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it. Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten. I'll look for it, Daryll Lee. What book? Hello, Daryll Lee. Do anything you want to me. I give myself to you. Only put the knife down. Isn't this what you always wanted? I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved. I could love you. You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness... That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers... I have no life anymore. I ruined your life, make me pay for it. Do it. If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it. Have enough guts to do it. Kill me, Peter, do it, now. Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium. Yes. I do. I want it to end now. Let her go. I'll come -- just let her go. She's not important. You've been perfect. Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop. For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it. You don't want her, you want me. You know I can't do that. It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it? Where are you, Peter? Who was the man in the basement? Why can't I drive home? I will. You. Look at you. You need a ride home. And you don't even know it. If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again? He hasn't done Bundy. He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel? Go there. See if there could be any way for him to escape. They never kill themselves. How do you know it was him. You never met him. You never even saw a photograph... W-We had a fight. I called him... called him a name... I am not going to talk about it. How do you know it was Andy if the head was gone? Where is the head? Are you looking for it? Oh, God, why him? Because of me. I can't talk about it. I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died. And it's because of me. This monster killed him because I loved him. Out. Where does he go? Nowhere. What does he do? Nothing. Maybe you should... Yes. Dahmer! And after that... The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes... Who's the married man? You're exhausted. Let me get you a brandy. He felt sorry for me. It was so nice to flirt. He was a darling man. What happened to you?! You do that one, I don't want it... Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten. We could use some help on the phones... '...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...' His greatest heroes ? He wants to be famous. When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month. They're like film stars. It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside. They weren't going to show it to me?! The arrogance! It's my life ! What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ! Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button. Just give me a minute here. The letter is addressed to me... You don't feel fear, do you? You're young. You feel like you'll live forever. How wonderful. They put Merry Saks on it?! Look in the crowd. He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work... One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going... What's that music. It's Abba. I can hear it. It's Abba. Why should I trust you? You betrayed me! Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me! This one, yes. I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants. Who's going to catch him? You? And if you do, there'll be another one. And one after that. Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him. Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive. This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex. He's playing a game with us. Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame. Just to prove he's better than all of them. They got caught; he didn't. It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims. Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with... Is that it? There were needle marks. But no drugs in her blood. Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night. Ruben. That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood. Have you got a warrant? Get the hell out o here! This is the only space I have left in the world ! Why can't you leave me out of it? I turned it off. It's like an open window he can climb right in... You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style? That doesn't happen. These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual. The method itself is part of the pleasure... Then what do you need me for? That's no surprise. He's going home. He slept over because I was a little anxious... Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them! They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent. You keep my name out of this. It's anybody connected to author- ity. They write, they even knock on your door. They're fans . It thrills them to flirt with getting caught. She probably let him in the door without a thought. Where are their mothers?! Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight? Maybe that's why you can't catch him. I know what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer. I am not going to look at any more pictures. They're like a disease. They get into my head. I can't get them out. Show what? It's gone. He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it. Then it erased itself. Gone... Do you remember what you saw? One officer already got killed trying to protect me. Please, just take it all away. Leave me alone. It's too big a file to copy to a disk. Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left? Click on that... twice. If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush. Now, I've done what you asked me. I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo. He used their own stockings to strangle them. Tied in a bow-knot. Where are the stockings he strangled them with? The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same. The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful. It's like... a signature. He's proud of his accomplishments. There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand. He wants us to recognize his hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding? He felt remorse. He covered her. It was a lover or a husband. Someone close. Somebody who knew her and cared about her. Is it an ongoing case? Will you go. Andy, make them go. Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck. That's the upside of having a breakdown. Oh, my God, no! I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary. I never leave this apartment now. Nobody ever comes here. I just wanted to get your attention. I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent. Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then. Yes, I did. Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated. You'll never catch him that way. You don't admire me. No police admire me. I got one of you killed. Why don't you say right out what you're here for? What calls? I haven't made any calls. If he's not out, why are they here? Is he out? I think this is number three... You're calling me a crank? Who is this? What else? They taught me at the FBI. I was very good at it. It scared me... I liked it. He was in my apartment! Why don't you shoot off the lock? Go and look for a note. Is there a phone booth there? Listen to me. Is there a gas station nearby? Don't hang up! She on the passenger side? It's a woman shot in a car? Will you stay? Please? I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want... him ...in my head... The lock... Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die! I'm falling! I'm going to fall! Well. Another time, then. I'll be all right. He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben. Are you always so bold? You and MaryJane aren't lovers. That would be much appreciated. Thanks. MaryJane. You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night. I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky. You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard. Or the worst: there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month. The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark. And then, one day, there are no more. What happened? Did he just stop? Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself? Did he die in an auto accident? Or a fight. Or get sick and die? It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth. And you never know. But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back? I know 'Halloran.' What's the rest of it? He's brilliant. This one is brilliant. It's gone. The file's not here. What did you do? It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops. This one's probably watching you , laughing at you. He can get into my computer any time he likes! This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen. That computer's wired into INTERNET. In the sixties. He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison. Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard. I don't want this. What are they? You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I am ! Make them some coffee. Halloran, is it? Investigator Goetz? I had a crank call myself-- he said... I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum. I thought he might be out of prison. He wants me, he doesn't care about her. Let me... He's got Sergeant Halloran in there. He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people... Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.Tell her about what ? Tell her we're sorry we bothered her. We'll get the paramedics... You talked to me. Do you remember? Investigators Halloran and Goetz. I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog. What Friday? You already made the delivery? You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum. I want Kurten's phone number. Doesn't work that way. You had your chance, now fuck yourself... You don't listen very good. This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole. Or I could see it gets forgotten. Shut up -- I'm talking. You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious... Cut the crap. You got a sheet the length of my arm... Inspector Halloran. Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten? Well, thanks. Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous. This has been the worst 48 hours of my life. I'm going home. I'm going to try to get drunk. Helen -- let go. You've got to let go. Helen. I saw him die. I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top. Christ, Helen. The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time. Knock yourself out. How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep? I've got to go. I've got to go. I'm working on it! It's what I do. Quinn...Halloran. I'll wait. Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here? Bundy. That's the last one in your speech... Look. There's the order: you wrote it: DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer. It's going to be Dahmer next. Which means he'll kill a man. What does it matter? This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up? Where's the john? Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work. A man? I thought he was a boy. This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why? It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love. Son of a bitch married men ! Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?! I just thought it was so -- unprofessional. Of you both! Ruben's dead. So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he... They're not talking to me. Saks looks right through me. I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that your little job." Condescending bastard. Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin. Daryll Lee Cullum? They get fan letters... It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan. You can't run away from it anymore. Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work. Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler. And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end? And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details. Injecting Windex. Using .44. Playing Abba. I put my ass on the line, giving you that. He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem. Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44. It's Son of Sam. Is it Son of Sam? What's that siren? Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work... Because I'm all you've got. I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own. Halloran. I'm giving you Clint outside. You're afraid of him. He'll get caught. If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up... Injected Windex! Why would he switch to a new m.o.? I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows... That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots... That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning. So far nothing they test for comes up positive. Hello, Ruben... So that's that... Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside. Helen -- the killer directly contacted you. His interest in you is intense . I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you. I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him. So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate. He comes in the window, we maybe grab him. Where's the on-switch? Who turned off the Internet computer... She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping." Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose. It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and posed ... Something's wrong with it. But it's a different m.o. We've got another one. I want a guard on you. I'm worried about leaving you alone. That's amazing. A whole new book, thought up in a minute. Very good. All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going? Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in your computer? Look at the sign. 'Hell'? In the Festival of Love? You make any sense in that? I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen. I don't look at pictures. I look at the real thing . I don't feel infected. We'll show that to... He won't. I'm going to put a guard on your door. Can you make a copy we can show on our computers? How do you know that? Work with me. Why imitate a dead serial killer? How did you know they were stockings? Nothing. How do you know that? For months... last October. You can't go out lecturing? Tough shit. Women are dying. Where can I lay this stuff out? Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here. I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts. I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good. I think you are. I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours. Would you want to work with us on this? Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black. You're absolutely correct. The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love. You called us , Doctor Hudson. I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you. Because of your phone calls. Who? Ring the gong, he goes. Poor impulse control. That's an opinion, not evidence... Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am? Do you know any of the victims... No, ma'am. This is no joke. And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help. Inspector Halloran, Homicide. I'm in charge here. Okay. How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson? She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes. Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop... Someone broke into her place last night. It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't... Over here. Who came in after you? Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later. You touch anything, Mike? Pick up anything? Use the doorknob? I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me. I'm over here? What's your name, Officer? Just horseshit luck. You're in terrible trouble, Nikko. Quinn will be here any minute. What are you going to say? If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job? Where did he pick her up? God, you're cute when you're mad. Don't put yourself down like that. I never used you. I worked my way up like a marine grunt! Well, you outranked me , Nikko. You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business. Oh, I know. Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko... Because it's your job, that's all. I'll talk to Conrad myself. I'll be in the jail when you wind this up... Don't try to lie, Ruben. You don't have the face for it. I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place... Helen... excuse me, we... Bunch of Swedish women. You're too young. The woman's unstable. You could wind up with a harassment charge. Anything . You're like some horny little teenager. You damn well better start working on that impulse control. A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of evidence ? Now listen up, Ruben. You never, never, never mess with somebody inside the case! Get the pictures, and casts of footprints. Yeah, everything's different. Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report. Look at her legs. What about her arms? Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it... She wasn't killed here. My promise. Why would he send this to Helen Hudson... Let's get out of here... Tell it to your shrink. Honest to God, Ruben! He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine. We heard from Doctor Hudson? Order Chinese for us and meet me the library? Anything but beef. Sure. She likes you , Rube. She likes the way you move. She sure as hell isn't in love with me. Snotty neurotic bitch... Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers... You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone. I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them. Answer it. My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that. She's in no shape to give her statement tonight... That was Bundy. He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls. ...this is hopeless. Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning? You want mine, too? You take his, you take mine. I'm the one fucked it up... Give me Ruben back... Or the F.B.I.? I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's... The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect... I gotta have Ruben, and a... Give him that pompous son of a bitch. If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic. What does this mean? Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening? Why Ruben, anyway? He and Nikko don't even get on together... Because I think I'm wrong. Helen Hudson... I'm sorry it had to come to your attention. I am dealing with it. You're damn right I do. It's not the same guy. It should be a self-solver. No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different. The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom. This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head. Sexually assaulted. The others weren't molested that way. We're waiting for the sperm tests... We could use a little help. Oh, maaaaan?! So. Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information? I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo. Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green. Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile. Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling. If they've got a German wife. We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon. Don't swear at me because we got problems. I'm just giving you the news. I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach. On the knuckles they teach. Yessir. I have reflected on that, sir. Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir. Yessir. That's always your privilege, sir. Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case? She's the expert. I need help. What clues? I'm going to work Helen Hudson. The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial. Good. Right. Right. Am I in charge of this thing? Or not. You messed with the scene. We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement... Detective Niccoletti? You messed with the evidence. I just got here. Talk to you later... I just got here myself, Susan.Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler? This is the fourth, is that correct? What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.? ... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer. Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence... ...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern? Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?That's what I don't know. Why would you lie? That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie. She doesn't lie! You sure you fed her? See, now you've annoyed her. You know she doesn't like you to touch me. Does she, widdle wee fing! Wuhve you so much! Did you feed her? You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself. Where're you? Put in the Kevin Costner.Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation. In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot. How's it going, Ray? You're welcome. Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them. We caught 'em. However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it. It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone. I think we've got something. Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc. Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?Go fix the phones. Cereal. Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run. I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look... "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers! Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven. Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc. Dreams? Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble. I can't believe they decided you won. You would have looked better. Oh, wow, she's great. Thanks for your help. Dade. Are you crazy? What are you doing? It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast. Alright, let's boot up. Ready? We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program. A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow. They're elite! Let's get 'em. There they are! Alright, so what have we got? It's my subway defense system. How? Well that's great. There goes MIT. Why did he come to you? You what? What? Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it. Right, and at this rate it ends its run in... Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks. The worm eats a few cents from each transaction. Uh, hold on... Okay, thank you. Thank you. Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that? What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help. We need your help. I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on. You're not gonna win. Make it my first born. You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want. If I win, you become my slave. Are you challenging me? Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?" Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything. P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium. It's too much machine for you. What the hell are you doing? You're the moron that's been invading my turf? What? He's not enrolled in this class. He's not in this class. What the hell is going on? Think you can do better? Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there. No, you're not in my class. Here's your class. You think they're going to bust us? Phreak? Hello? Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin? What is he doing in here? Hey! What are you guys doing in here?Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer? Colonel who? Cancer? What's happening? Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me. "Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe. What is it? What's wrong? Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that! You said the worm was untreaceable! They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know? So? Congratulations. Pervert! What are you talking about? Murphy kid turn you down? Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You... But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid? I don't want to go to jail for this. What? What the hell was that all about? So what are we supposed to do? What, it left a note? Excuse me? Virus? Precisely what you're paid to prevent. Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.And unpack. Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late. And would you try and please fill these out? Aaaah. Did we meet someone special? What did we learn in school today? How was school? You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade? Right, Dade?! Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week. Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you? Up all night again, huh? Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet? Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday. What are you doing? Dade?That's so cool. Isn't that French for something? D'Amour. How'd you spell that again?What is he? And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years? Why did you wait so long? Jesus. Valentin. What did you do to your face? Harry-? Is it finished? Harry? Don't look. Yes. I'm here, Harry. Harry... You can't. Oh God! Harry? Are you all right? What was that? And Pimm and Swann. Only Nix was ready for them. Yes. I was twelve. Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him. I know. I'm the one who shot him. Are you sure? I was so afraid. Nothing? No it isn't. You can't help me. I was grateful to him. I owed him my life. And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it. I wasn't. No. I told you -- Some or it. He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things. And he could levitate. Juggle fire. Swann said he could do stuff, yes. It was more than that, I think. Oh Christ. What did you find? Flesh is a trap. That's what he used to say. Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free. Why did you come back? Yes. You do that. It doesn't ring a bell. I have to go. Yes... I'm here. And no. I don't know the name. That's my business. Harry. He... didn't have me.. I told you- They were jealous of him. How did it go today? Yes. I think you probably can. We'd need to talk about your fee. They won't tell you anything. I don't know where you'd start. I heard what happened. It looks like somebody murdered him. You haven't seen anything yet. I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour. Tonight? Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience. They love him. That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening. Harry. Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour? No. You're right. He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more. But people get lost. Even good people. Too much fame. Too much money, You don't believe me. We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive. We haven't slept in the same bed for years. We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do. He's a secretive man. I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past. I think we make our own futures. Yes. They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while. I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards. I want you to help me help my husband. I know he's in some kind of trouble. And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered. What about me? Harm to whom? Me? I don't think, so. Try him again at the hotel. No word from D'Amour? You saw this? Valentin? Sure. You want me to find out about Quaid? I mean, the funeral? Oh God. Sure. ... they believe you. Bad show last night?No. He's coming back. He's digging his way out! Yes! Yes! Nix! Nix! He's not! He's not! I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me. He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything. He made us think it was over and done with. I knew Swann. He's a fucking liar. Maybe... I... don't... Only I forget. They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things, Have we met before?I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another. And what are you, his chaperone? Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go-- And how many people will be attending this birthday party? And what's the occasion of this celebration? An invitation? No! At least I don't think I am! What! Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up. Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow. It doesn't seem to be too long. I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger? I'd love to. Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there. It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch. What happened? Jesus, what happened to you? Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life. That's the subject of my last chapter. Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true. Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities? Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction. American literature. What else? It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation. Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here. Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine. I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works? I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you? Will that be cash or charge?Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously. No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead. Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did. Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me. His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back. And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead." I figured he had a right to know. Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this. A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill. No thank you. He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is. Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place? His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years. He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn. I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself. Do you mind if I sit down? He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects. His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents? I just want to know where he is. And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what? Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was? Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew. Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister. I'm looking for my nephew, Thomas. What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think? I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all. Is your name Paul Benjamin?An abortion, stupid. I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore. Bye-bye, baby! Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now. Baby? And what baby is that? Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye. I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass. What do you want me to say? Well what? Yeah? Who is it?Anything, Auggie. Just name it. I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it. I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it. You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven. For keeps? And you're giving it to me? Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here. What's this? Bully for you. Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car. I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke. Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday. Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business. I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around. You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is. When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie. She looks just like you. Wait till you see her, Auggie. That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth. Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something. It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her. I told her she was going to meet her father. Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car. Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me. Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you. You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie? I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie. Who the hell knows? He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago. Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name. And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds. It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad. It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then. You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think? Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to? I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie. It means "happiness." Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen. She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant. I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild. Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything. And besides, it's not for me. It's for our daughter. Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up. I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming. Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps. This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I. I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out. You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth. I don't want to talk about it. If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief. You're looking good, Auggie. Eighteen and a half years. What are you talking about? Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you. You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late. Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you. I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that. Aren't you going to say anything? Well? It's me, honey. It's Mom.MOM!! MOM!! Sid, give her back! Give her back now! I'm telling! NO-O-O... Don't touch her! NO! No she's NOT -- Hey!! What? I don't know! I dunno. What?Let's let Molly open one. See? Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them. Oh, great, you found them. Where were they? What? What is it? Everybody say, "Bye, house." Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow. I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat. Oh, I'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough. Where was the last place you left him? Next stop... Yeah -- when you're sixteen. Sure! I'll even let you drive. Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him. Well, honey, just grab some other toy! Now c'mon! Andy! I'm heading out the door. No, I haven't seen him. You can bring ONE toy... Oh, all this packing makes me hungry. What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet? Come on down, guys. It's time for games! We've got prizes! Now go get Molly. Your friends are going to be here any minute. Well, sure, we can leave it up. Whadda ya think?I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop. James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West! They may be looking for us, James. Use this. You can fix it in the Men's Room. Airports all look the same. Maybe it's... James! Your moustache! It's slipping. That's what they were up to! Freeing animals! I remember you...like this. I feel I've known you before. I feel I've always known you. Well, you look pretty different, too. In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't. If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police. So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music. So we can appreciate what we have while we have it. Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry. If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers. Shh -- don't talk. Hold still. You... you couldn't have heard me. I couldn't resist. I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys... No superiors! No scientists. No people from the future. It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company. They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned. It's a Carpet Cleaning Company... I...I...We need cash, James. James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number! You tried to call and... Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to. I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon. You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James! How did it get there? What does this mean to you? IT WASN'T A TV SHOW! IT WAS REAL! James, you said he was hiding in the barn... The boy in the well. How did you know that was just a hoax? You disappeared! One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods? Just like that? You were in prison? Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what? We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you. James! That's a policeman. Pretend you don't know me. If he sees you... You're sure? Give me the gun. First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay? It can be dealt with, but only if you want to. I can help you. Nobody is going to wipe out the human race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else. You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face. What made you think that? See -- you can drive after all! What have you done? Did you...kill someone? You have to give yourself up, you know. No. I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you. Shot! Who shot you? What's the matter with your leg? I thought you didn't know how to drive. And he told you then his father was a famous virologist. You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago. Jeffrey Mason? James, why don't we...? You didn't have a gun before, did you? Oh, Jesus, James! You killed him! Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes... Who's keeping an eye on you? I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise. But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is. What do you mean -- when you were a kid? Does that disturb you, James? Thinking about that little boy in the well? What will you do...when you find this...secret army? Clues? What kind of clues? You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever. What are you doing? It wasn't me before, James. It's become me now because of...what's happening. Please untie me. And I was in it? What did I do? We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about? Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child? Something so bad...? "If something really happens"...like what, James? What? You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you. Yes, I remember. Why do you want to go to Philadelphia? I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole. Have you been...following me? Cole! James Cole! You escaped from a locked room six years ago. I have to do this, James. You're very confused. It's just a shot to calm you. I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...? James, where did you grow up? Was it around here? Around Baltimore? Perhaps it was a wrong number... 1995 is the future, James. This is 1989. You think it's July of 1995? That's the future, James. Do you think you're living in the future? What year do you think it is? Do you know what year it is? July. Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James? You're afraid of germs? What's wonderful about the air, James? Hiding? A jail? Prison? You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital? Why not? Most people have some ID. You don't have a driver's license, James? Or a Social Security card? I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers? Do you know why you're here, James. Change what? What kind of information? Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace? I'm going to be completely honest. I'm not going to lie to you. I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you. And I want you to trust me. Can you do that, James? May I call you "James"? Mr. Cole? My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist. I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that? And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen? Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion. And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen. I'm losing my faith. For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die! He was fully sedated! I said it was bad judgment! What else do you want me to say? Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and... I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just... No, thank you. Yes, please. You said he gave a name... That would explain the bruises, I guess. The struggle. You have him in restraints. He's been tested for drugs? What? What did you say? Tight? My watch says 7:30. Nine thirtyTwelve Monkeys, honey. Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning. On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor. Might be tight.Got it. I don't set policy. You have the key? I need your help-- There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way. Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is. But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming. I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think. I should have told him. Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure. Any sign of Lindenmeyer? The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again. Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous. What's the assignment? Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me? Then fix it. Talk so I can understand. Turn it down! Show me his physical sensory level. What's wrong with Parker? What do we do now? Duck! I couldn't tell you. Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had... I don't know. My guess is dead. More or less. You okay? That's why I'm asking. You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go �� right now. Why are you going to do this? Can I ask you something? Find out anything? Thanks. I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone... That, or living through him... If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind. Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes. The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think? I was wrong. And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again. You're not capable of it. How did you find out about the toxin? He didn't know about the neural toxin. I did. We know you didn't kill those guards. No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was. Get a hold of yourself! Parker -� stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you�� Which way? You could have just flashed him your badge, you know? It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences. Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media. I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing. Whatever it is, he isn't finished... Whatever he was doing here was only the start. I'm doing the best I can! This isn't a game, Parker! Enjoying yourself? What did you do to those people? What the hell's going on?! Don't get out of the car. I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them. Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I... You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re�adapting quite well. Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant... What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before. Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve. Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming. I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes. Thank-you. Her name is Karin. I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life. How did you get your hand out? And I'm going to make sure of it. Give me your wrist. Give me your wrist. In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick... Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory. We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile. As a matter of fact, it is. But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones. Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain. He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite. Who said that? I am impressed. I am the demon from the bottomless pit... The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho. Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains? I'm still working on it. This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work. Checking my pulse. It's elevated. You enjoy frightening me, don't you? You've got a problem with me carrying a gun? Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers. Stay here. He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin. I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him. Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done. The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7? Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better �� to improve upon what was already done. He was re�enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders. You ready for this? You all right? It wasn't a lie. What you need is a collar. I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand. It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it? But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved. You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did. You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target... What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy? That's not true, Parker. I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing. If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation. In other words, par for the course. How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday? No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you. How you feeling today?
