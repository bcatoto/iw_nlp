I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause. Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way. Did you ask Sal? And? So? What did he do this time? That's not even true. I just want a slice. I truly hope so. I'm tired of supporting a grown man. ...peanuts. Oh, it doesn't, huh! You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips... Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman. You gotta lotta nerve. Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do. Come off it. You are too crude. I didn't stutter. You heard me. He's completely innocent. He's just being nice. What are you so worked up about? Stop tripping. See ya around. I'll see ya there. No. I'm going with you. Hurry up and get dressed. I didn't stutter. Take care of your responsibilities. Y'know exactly what I'm talking about. Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities. I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all. I'm carrying you as it is. I think no such a thing. Sal pays you, you should work. Sal's gonna be mad. Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches? How come you're not at Sal's? I'm in here. Do me a favor. Go to work. Good! Leave me alone when I'm sleeping. I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here. Wake up? Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late. Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping? Whew! And move to Long Island... You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right. I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner. How are you holding up in this weather? Sorry, comb got caught. Yeah, me too. This might take some time. I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now. Where's the stuff?We're still standing. I didn't. Yes indeed. You almost got yourself killed last night. Good morning. You're welcome. Maybe you shouldn't. Don't get happy. This changes nothing between you and me. You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it. That was a foolish act, but it was brave. That chile owes you his life. Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know. Hold your tongue. You don't have that much love. You're a drunk fool. The evil eye doesn't work on me. And move to Long Island. Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire. Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got. I'm too through with yar people. Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house. Every year I keep threatening to sell it. I'm not studying no Mayor. Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples. My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul. Don't like 'em. A fan will do. I'll do. Be gentle, child. Mother Sister is an old woman. That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch! Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed? I got nowhere to go. We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while. Jade, you're late.You're to the curb. You better step off. Get a life. Act like one then. Be a man. Be a man. You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son. Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something. You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week. Where are you going? Feels good. What? Later for you. It's cold. Of course I'm sweating. I'm burning up. It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here. I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight. Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love. Trust you? Because of trusting you we have a son. Remember your son? What else? You a blue-moon fool. That's out. No! It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when? How long then? No! No! You won't come back either. And I really wanted some ice cream too. Your memory is really getting bad. Where's the ice cream? The Hï¿½agen- Dazs butter pecan? How else was I going to get you here? I haven't seen you in a week. Come in then. What took you so long? Is it hot? Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up. Do you love me? When? I want you to spend some time with me. I want you to try and make this relationship work. If not, I'd rather not be bothered. I work too, but I still make time.
