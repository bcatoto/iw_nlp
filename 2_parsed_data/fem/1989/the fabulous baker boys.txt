Suit yourself. We have some lotion. Too bad. You could use some sun. Really. Swimming trunks. Frank. Honey ... Honey ... You bring trunks, Jack? I'll take her inside. You too, little Frank. Out of the pool.I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit. Shit, thank God. You look like a creep. Will I see you again? Funny hours. How come? Whatcha doin' over there?No. It's our goddamn car! You're not going to drive! You're not going to drive.Well ... thanks. Bye. Oh, sorry. I get so caught up in it sometimes. It's scary. Really? Isn't that a coincidence. Candy Man.' Is that all right? And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career. But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche. If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up. No romance, right? That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer. Moran. Monica. The whole thing. It's my stage name. My real name's Blanche. Actually, that's my stage name.All right. All right. Just call me a cab. No, no. You boys are tired. A few empty tables. It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night. Thrilling. Both of you. Spur of the moment. Yes. I supposed you still have that old phone booth. You miss him, don't you? Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in. He mentioned you had a girl for a while. A singer. Is that the way it is? And you don't? It went well tonight. I'm tired. Really. I should get home. Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?Oh, look at you two. So skinny. And those tiny suits ... Oh no! I thought these were lost. Where did you find ... Oh my God ... Catholics. What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake. Yes, yes. It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association. I thought maybe held gotten over that. A little stiffer, but just as sturdy. Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys! Yes. Right. Eddie. How is he? How's that dog of yours? What was his name? None? Big piece or little? Oh, fine. So. How are you? John. It's good to see you.That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman. There were more flowers last year. Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's. Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows. I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack? Merry Christmas, Jack. Can I stay here tonight? Even if she comes here? Jack. From Hurley's? Not so good. How'd the show go? I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth. What's a prom? Why not? Wow. Looks old. I hope not. He's already busted the springs in two chairs. Hey, what's this? I guess it's getting serious. I saw his stuff in the bathroom. Oh. Bigfoot gets his out of a can. What are they? Is that what you used to do? Married. Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular. All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner. And breakfast. Guess they're up. Did you break a cup, Jack?And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night. Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore! I'm gonna throw up, Frank. I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay? That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick. I can't sing it anymore. Huh? Forget it. Some discussion. Decency? Hey listen, pal ... Uh ... Huh? Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank! What's with you guys? Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them. Huh? What's with you two? Oh yeah? I don't believe it. You're a romantic, Frank. They must've bought the same map we did. Wow. You ever see her again? What'd she sing? Peggy Lee? You're kidding me. Great? Hey, we're connected. Smells like tuna number two to me. Smells like fish. I don't believe it. Okay.The Fantasy Inn. He's right. Virgins? Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise. What's with the stars? You play all these places? Maybe we should just listen to the radio. Well, well. Ho, ho, ho. You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank? So find a dime. Let's get out of here. Maybe it's legit. Hey. We take the Avedon, right? Simple. The Carlton's a dump. No cover. No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd. I was gonna split it with you guys. Hey! For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it. Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you? I said I was sorry. Switch? What fucking switch? Piece of cake. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ... You're a prince. Oh, thanks. Well, they're aspiring to be sevens. They're tight. Shoes? Zip me up? What do you think? Nine! Nine. Hey, pal. I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go. Save it for your wife. I wear a seven. A seven. If you ask me, this is pretty stupid. Time for what? Hey! Am I missing something? What's wrong with it? Do I look like I'm naked? What's he talking about? Changed? And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster? Where's my name? So work with me, not against me. Okay? What I mean is -- I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right? The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this... ... music. You know what I'm saying? What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden? Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business. When? So? I sing now? Hey, it's legit. Strictly dinner and dance. Funny how life repeats itself, huh? Over and over. Like a song. Yeah. Sneak out in the morning. Before the guy could wake up and ruin it. Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though. Let me get the light. Well, this is some surprise. Hey ... You don't look so good, pal. Jack. Tell egghead I said hi. If you see him. Listen... you want to get a drink? I got a new place. Or we could go to a bar ... Well, maybe not a bar. But I know a place uptown, if you want -- Oh. Carrots. And peas. None of the important ones. Huh? Terrific. I'm doing vegetables next week. Yeah. Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure. You two. So ... ? Saw the sign outside. Got your own sign, huh? You can always get another girl. Shit. I think I started a fire. Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes! Yeah... No. Oh. Hi. Sorry. Frank said --- Oh. Wow. But I still don't see how ... So, what happened? You're kidding. Nervous? You sending me home? Oh. So what's it doing here? The both of them? In there? No kidding? Huh? Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean. Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe. The older ones, they were okay. Nice. Polite. Pulled the chair out for you. But the younger ones ... Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again. She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart. There are killers with palms like a baby. Soap convention. You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank. At the Roosevelt. Like diamonds, huh? I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself. She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it. Sure. Ed? How many people live here? Friend? What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her. Who's Nina? Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit! You were good. You were good. What's that supposed to mean? All I said was you were good. You're upset. What'd I say? What's the matter? Better than that. How do you do it? Every night? Guess I got a little scattered. It wasn't business. It was pleasure. Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in. If you want, I got a pack in the room. In and out. How's egghead? It's the waves. God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean. Can't sleep? Oh, sorry. With the light always on, it's hard to tell. So why's he do it? Aren't the kids asleep? He do that every year? Nothing personal -- I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all. Hey, listen. You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp. No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back. You kidding? We must've killed three pots in there. Anyway, I gotta get home. Rest the pipes. Mmm. Like kissing a rose. Well, au revoir. Paris Opals. Twelve-and-a-half cents. I sat down with a pencil and added it one day. But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best. Ah, here's a lost soul. Nice place. Fulla velvet. Even the bedspreads. Damn! Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that? Uh-uh. I never touch American cigarettes. What's tomorrow again? Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame. Shit. I don't know. It's hard figuring you two as brothers. Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere. Where's egghead? Oh. Well, for Blackie then. The Park? It's only two nights. Why throw away a night? Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway. Not for money. With my mother. Hey, he's not sore, is he?I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over. Florence Simmons. Susie. Susie Diamond. What's that mean? Thirty-eight. You find a girl? So run a little longer. So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here? I don't believe it. I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late. How should I take it? Just like that, huh? You're not even gonna give me a chance? This is show business? My watch is broken, too. What about me? What do you mean? This where the auditions are? Right. In there. They never do, Mr. Barker. You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten. Right. Bring him back. Barker. Jock Barker? You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you. So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here. What d'ya say?
