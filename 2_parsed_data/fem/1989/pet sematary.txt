He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair-- Is that right, dad? Yes-- What if you can't read what's written on there anymore? Well...I guess not. Bite? But where are we going, Mr. Crandall? I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to. Please hurry. Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay? He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost. Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He-- Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late! Paxcow says it's almost too late! I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy! But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary? Yaay! Am I really gonna have my own room? Do you swear? Come with us, daddy. Please come with us! And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and... Then why do I have to go to bed? I'm not tired! Yeah, sure. I don't get it. You believe in it. Do you believe that? Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose. I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think? At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell. Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven? Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever! No more chocolate chip cookies. She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy-- I hate that smell. Because you promised. Is he really all right? Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary. Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair. Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation! It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks! In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he? That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much. To remember. I want to look around, daddy-- may I? Well, I thought it was safe-- Yayyy! Hurrts! It hurrrrts! Yaay!I will. Come and kiss me. Of course I will. There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense. Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman? Ellie...Ellie...what... In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn. Honey, Church will be fine. Yes, but the rope might be-- It's gorgeous! Don't bother. I'm coming home. Was it Pascow? Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car? How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children! Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you. I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here. Louis, are you sure? Oh Louis, I just don't know about this-- I'm going to try to do better. Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know. I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard. That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda. I heard you tonight. I got eggs down here! Thank you, Louis. Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise. You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face. I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place. That's enough of that kind of talk! Don't be silly. Church is not going to die. Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die. It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it. She's finally asleep. Extraordinarily morbid, maybe. It's beautiful! ---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and--- You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you? Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go? Thank you. Thank you so much. Gage's gone! Come on--let's parole 'em. Louis, the house is beautiful.
