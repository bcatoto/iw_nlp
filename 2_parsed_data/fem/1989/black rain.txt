I wasn't expecting you. If you give me one. You'll take care of that. All right, how's the new partner? It's getting too cold even for me, Nick. Yeah... I came to save you. If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.Maybe. If I come visit, we can find out. Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head. Wouldn't help. Watch out for Ich. I still think you're a bastard. Bullshit, Nick. And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not. You'll get Ich killed. The cheese... This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson... They want your autograph. I don't remember saying yes. 'Nam oyo ranged kyo.' You think it's dumb of course. I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense. I chant. You met her. He's got a reason. You're wrong to sell Ich short. And I'm supposed to care? My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in. I've heard of Sugai. I've also heard of the emperor. They're both national treasures. One's a hood. Where's Ich? Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice. I paid for that. Don't be an ass. She ever pull down her shades? I don't think so. Look, you need Ich. I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs. You have a helluva way of asking for help. I don't give tours. An outside person. A foreigner. A barbarian. You, me. More you. Dead gaiijin's are big news. Ich said you left. He gets as much as he wants.You want him dead too. He'll find out you took me. I'm unprotected. He'll kill us. All of us. You don't stand a chance. You're smarter than Kobo. You know the price of deceit. Think about it. Swiss bank deposit. Gold bullion. Whatever you want. You know the city and the police. I'll pay you. The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me. Not with these bills. And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be? Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar. Yes. Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them. Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us. He'll be dealt with. I took Kobo from the street. I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man. Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun. He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired. -- Kobo... I know. He killed two of my partners. One in New York, one at the printing plant. Seven years work by the finest engraver. Mass produced, sequentially numbered. The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
