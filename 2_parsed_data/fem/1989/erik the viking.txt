It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking! But, Father, it IS! It's your fantasy... There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic... It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other.... You're losing your temper! There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself. There IS no one. Who, Father? Ah! It's my father! I don't want to live WITHOUT you. Then I shall come too. No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return. Blow the third note! The note to take us home! Erik! You've done what you came to do! The second note. Then let go! You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU? Do you believe I love you? YOU still want to go to Asgaard? No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength. No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us. No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father! But you don't realize.... Erik. You don't understand. No! Why? I mean, you could have killed yourself. But, Erik... Who? You're as bad as my father. That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE... Oh, for goodness' sake! The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift. I've never LOVED anybody! Why do you go on about that? What does it matter? But you LOVED her all the same... What was she like? What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before... No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams? No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them? Have you ever felt like this about anyone else? But surely you know...? WHY? Put them down! PLEASE make them put them down. PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing! Those things in your hands. Please! Please! What are those? Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil. Well, of course. We always welcome friends. I said welcome.That I cannot tell you. The Gods are asleep, Erik. The sky WAS blue, Erik... once. But have you ever seen it? Think back... Have you ever seen the sun, Erik? Is it summer or winter, Erik? Is it night or day, Erik? What do you see, Erik? They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories? Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?Please. What d'you expect me to do? Yeah... well... Bye, Leif.Why should you care? You'll have to wait till he's finished his game. Have you tried to ask the God for anything? What's the point of being dead in the land of the living? What a stupid idea. Why... should YOU care? I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable... Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts... Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death. Aaagh! Rape! Ah. And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on. Well you started it. But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out. Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting? What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it? You DON'T like it, do you? About raping me? What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me... What? Oh, get it over with. What -- rape? You don't love ME. It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life. What about the raping? Looting and pillaging, eh? Have you done this sort of thing before?And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it. And keep your sword greased. And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you. And something to sharpen them with? And you've got BOTH axes?
