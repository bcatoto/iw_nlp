Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay? Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine! I just washed this shirt, didn't I? He's a mess! I still am. I was hilarious once, wasn't I? Gee, it's easy. Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate? Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know. Why do you eat that stuff? There's no food in your food. Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason. I hope you understand. I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat. Your big graduation, and no one was there. Lloyd?The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy. No, you're not a guy. Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart. Like Joe and I were ripped apart. What does it say? Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter. Something. You've got to do something special. You've got to make a statement. Lloyd, listen to me. EVERYTHING has changed. You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two. You might be sixty. You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'. Did you sleep with her? See you. Bye. Bye Diane. Yes. You are such a great person Lloyd. I'm a good person, but you are a great person. Okay, I got it. That's just so embarrassing. C'mon Lloyd. Lloyd. Lloyd, give it up. Brains stay with brains. The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques. Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain. Then what's love? Going out as friends. That's not even a scam. But you never had a first date. That's unlikely. "Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd." I've never gotten a letter like this, have you? What? I'm sorry, talk. And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever... You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe... Look at his face, he did the deed. He's got that nervous talking thing. I told him not to speak. Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd. Lloyd is doomed. I'm sorry. It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt. Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is. Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word. Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook? Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll." Y'know, it's all so phoney. I don't feel anything. If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd? It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd. Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it. I wrote sixty-three songs this year. They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.Alright. Confirm this with my office and my client. He'd like to start serving immediately. I can accept that. One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?No, no he's not. How can you, how can you say that? You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this. What's the profile? Pardon me? I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life. I don't even care. I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me. But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me? Be a little decent. I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye. Hello. You're right. I'm so ashamed dad. No, I will. I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you. You're a liar, and a thief. No. I told you everything, you lied to me. I would have done anything for you. I trusted you. I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you. You let me believe you. You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it. God, how... how could you... No, but you stole from them. Yes, I... You stole from them, you lied to me. How do you think that's supposed to make me feel? What am I supposed to think? But I found the money. Swear to god. Swear to god, I need to know the truth. Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money? Dad, are you okay in there? If I pick it up, we'll only get back together. Dad, I love him. Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen. What's wrong with having some fun? I like him. Dad, you and I have talked about this. Lloyd and I have talked about this. Believe me, this is well-covered territory. Unbelievable. This is a nightmare. I like him a lot. Dad, why are you acting this way? Is this because of the other morning? You're not listening to me. It doesn't feel right to me. I, I don't even have the right luggage yet. But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year. Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you. Dad, no. But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him. Dad, yes. And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now. I know that. I'm fine. Dad, I'm so sorry. I know this is a bad time. I was irresponsible, I should have called. Dad, I'm sorry. Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream. Okay, I give up. And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around. I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous. Dad. Goodnight. Lloyd was such a gentleman. He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it. I called him basic. Can you believe I did that? Dad, I'm so glad I went. Goodnight. Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous. God, I'll have to go on a plane. I won? Are you kidding? You're not kidding? You're not kidding! Tell me, is it bad news? What? I love you dad. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Everybody thinks I'm a priss. I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it. Oh god, I don't need all these presents. I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean... God, that's... this is ridiculous. What are you doing? Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend. Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot. But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us? We all know what the answers are. We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family. But what if that doesn't happen? I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world. But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared. Alright, no more, I'm going to save it. I didn't think anyone would get it. You like it? Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back. Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out. You will? If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him? I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad. This is me telling you about me. Mom, please? I know. Nobody thought we'd do this. Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they? Not right now, thanks. Okay. Good to know. Okay. Okay. I'm fine. I love you. Please, I love you. I love you. How many more times do I have to say it? I love you. Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die. My father's guilty. He lied to me, he lied to everybody. I just left home... I need you. I'm sorry. Oh shit. Don't be mean, this is hard for me too. Lloyd, I love you, okay? You have Corey and DC. I have my dad. Just my dad. No, that's fine. She'll tell everybody, but that's fine. Why, did you tell Corey what happened? No. No I didn't. Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share. No, I don't, I don't. I think that we should stop going out on dates. No. We decided that we're friends. I mean, I know it's a terrible word... No, no. We decided... Yeah, uh-huh. We'll see. Yeah. Well, I need to study, and... I think that we should spend some time apart. How can I look at you and say this? I know. Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level. I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that... No, we don't have to say it. It was wonderful. Uh-huh. It was wonderful. Your letter came yesterday. Here are some blankets. This is a good song, this is a really good song. Then why are you shaking? You're cold. You're shaking. Yes. Are you shaking? Yeah. This is so noble. Yeah. Oh. I was putting the... Am I wrecking my car? Right. Yeah? I'm doing alright. Yeah. Friends with potential. Be friends? I just can't have any social life right now. I just don't want it to get too heavy. I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things. But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling? Do you know what I mean? Well... just meet her. Yes. She's amazing. She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you. You have to meet Bess. Okay, bye. Stop by later. I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old. Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours. Come on. I know you think my job is strange. You don't like old people, do you? I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by. I had a checklist in mind. I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash. But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't. You think so? Yeah? Yeah, I've had it forever. I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up. Or, or I could always wear this one. Then call me later. Then call me tomorrow. I only have something like sixteen weeks. No, I'm serious. So what's your job this summer? You're a great date. I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you. You know what? Thanks. But either way it still feels... Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them. So I chose my dad. It just felt safer that way, you know? Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it. Yeah. I'm so glad we did this. Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me. Nobody knew me before tonight. Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"... Bye. Thank-you. He does this every year? Yeah. So it's an honor? Keymaster? Oh. Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early? What are these? Would you hold this for me? Goodbye. Eight. I'll go. I'll go. Well... Actually, I think that I... Hmmm.... Well, not monumentally. Saturday, I have some things to do around the house. Yeah, I have to help my father. Yes. Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks. Oh, thanks, but I'm busy. No, I read it on the message. Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square. Yeah. Yeah. What a day. Thank you very much. Yeah? Hi. You called me? Thank-you. The real world.Hang tough, Lloyd. Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you. We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College. Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you. That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing. You have to decide on a career. Lloyd. You missed every one of your career counselling sessions. Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now. Lloyd. Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.Okay. Oh, here's Ray. Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down. Alright. If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier. You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do? You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life? Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest. I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd. What is wrong with this girl? Why? I just saw Joe. He's here.
