Well we can't just stay here -- Maybe we should just leave -- Don't you care? That's probably her now. Or the police. She'll tell them everything... I said no. I don't. Yes. They'll never find us. And the blood let you out? So you were cheated. You're still afraid. Who did? And you came back here to solve the puzzle -- Hell... What kind of doors? Let me see. A box? You promised me an explanation. Tell me, damn you. I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you. Later. Well? You're hurting. Keep your voice down. Who? Good. Hurting. What do you want me to do. Ssh! Back from where? What happened to you? No. God no. Tell me who you are. Who are you? Oh my God. I'm very happy. What about Larry -- But you said -- Well? I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome. Oh. Oh yes. Oh. That's right. Who are you? No, damn you -- I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see? This afternoon. You look terrible. Have you had an accident? Of course. There's no need to shout. What's the problem? Kirsty? It's very late. The keys are in the kitchen. Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches. Just to your left. There's a towel in the bathroom. Kirsty. Dead. It's better you see for yourself -- I don't know where to begin... Please. I can't bear it... Please... Don't go upstairs. Larry... -- I'll go see. Fine. I've seen worse. Who was it? Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe? I'll be down in a minute Maybe a brandy. I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while. Just feeling a bit sick. I'm here. Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed. Larry.... No you won't. You're done worse. Take it slowly. No, you're not. It's probably going to need stitches. Let me see. You're NOT going to faint. Is it deep? What have you done? It looks like a bomb's dropped. Why not? He's here? In here. Larry! No argument. All right. No. I'm not. You mean we're moving in? I thought half of it was your brother's? Not exactly modern. Why didn't he want to sell it? How long since you were here? It smells damp. Just a thought -- Maybe somebody changed the lock. We're going to freeze to death. What's wrong? Am I? Maybe I will. Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm. That's right. I prefer the floor. We don't need a bed, do we? No. That's right. Let's keep it that way, shall we? Do you care ? No. No. Let's go upstairs. I... suppose so, yes. You want something to drink? There's a first time for everything. That depends. Please. Just soda. Not much. What?Sure. Where's my father? What's happening? Not much. Hi. You can keep them. Stay the fuck away from me. No. That wasn't the deal. I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me. HE did. I've seen him. To a man called Frank Cotton? You did this before, right? Let me alone, will you? No! This isn't for real. Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from. Who are you? It's just a puzzle box. Oh Christ. I don't remember. Please listen to me -- It's important. I have to speak to my father. Frank -- Bastard. You bastard -- Oh my God. This isn't happening. You want it? No. This isn't happening. Don't touch me. Or so help me -- No. No. Julia! Oh my God. I saw everything. I was here this afternoon. I have to see my father. Where's Daddy? Sure. What happened? Which is where? Hi. I got soaked. Steve. You wouldn't believe me. I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in? My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him. Who brought me in here? Wait a moment -- What happened to me? I have to get out. It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over -- PLEASE. You're in danger. Get the fuck out of here. Yes! I want to see. I don't believe it. Gone? Finished? No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's -- I have to talk to you. Sure. What? Really? She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her. Maybe you should give it some time. I love you too. Yeah. I just wanted to be sure you were O.K. I've forgotten. Sure. O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee. Surprise. Is Julia here? Me like. Big house. I will. See you. Take care, Dad. Of course. Every day. I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.? It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you? Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job. Great. I'm not going to change my mind, Dad. YOU'D like my room. No Dad. I said: I found a room. I found a room. I got through. Daddy? 'Bye. Sure. Why not? Will you GO, damn you? Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me -- Don't let them take me, Steve -- These THINGS... they want to take me -- Steve. Thank God you came. As long as you don't mind the smell of fur -- Just trying to get my apartment in order. No, it's good to see you. If I make it through the day. I've been better. Oh! It's not what I heard. Oh no? There ya go. I beg your pardon? Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid. She's so damn... English. Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia. What do we do if there isn't? All right. No. That's nice. Not that late. You know I do know the way home. I'm coming! Sleep well. I'm here. I AM house-trained. Just upstairs. I won't be able to stand. That's right. Cointreau.Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name? Try me. Of course. This isn't a prison you know. Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman -- I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually. What a pretty tune. I won't be a moment. I'll get the doctor. You're awake. Good girl.
