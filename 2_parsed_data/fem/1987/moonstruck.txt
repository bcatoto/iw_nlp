What d'you know about coffee? Gimme  a loaf of bread. He looks great. That Al Conti is a genius. If you're an artistic genius, how  come you got butter on your tie? Give it here. I'll give you this,  Al, you make good coffee. The man who sends those spends a lot  of money on something that ends up  in the garbage can. Without me, you'd be out of business.  I like flowers. You don't want the fish. It's the oily fish tonight. Not before  the plane ride. Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me,  too. That will give you a base. For your  stomach. You eat that oily fish, you  go up in the air, halfway to Sicily  you'll be green and your hands will  be sweating. What do you think I am, a talking  dog? You can kiss my aspirations!  Professor! She was too young for him. Fine, Bobo. We'll take the check. You never have dessert. What's the matter? I shouldn't. What? Bobo, take the cart away. Are you proposing marriage to me? You know I was married and that my  husband died. But what you don't  know is I think he and I had Bad  Luck. We got married at the City Hall and  I think it gave bad luck the whole  marriage. Right from the start we didn't do it  right. Could you kneel down? Yes, on the floor. I helped you buy it. It came with  two pairs of pants. It's for luck,  Johnny. When you propose marriage to  a woman, you should kneel down. Where's the ring? I woulda sprung for a ring if it was  me. You could use your pinky ring. You propose to a woman you should  offer her a ring of engagement. Yes, Johnny. Yes, John Anthony  Cammareri. I will marry you. I will  be your wife. What time is it? So we'll pick up the car, we'll make  the plane in plenty of time. What about the wedding? How near is she to death? Then let's set the date. How about a month from today? Where? At the City Hall? No! I want  the whole wedding or we will have  Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be  planned, a date must be set. A month from today? I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll  take care of the whole thing. All  you have to do is show up. Oh, you're not going. You're staying. The Shawfish? Then, I suppose the time has come  say it's been nice Dwight Lionel.  It's been everything. Oh, Dwight,  I'm frightened. Call me when you get in. You've made me very happy, Johnny. Who is he? You have a brother? Sure. Yeah. My fiancï¿½. I don't believe in curses. Right. The key's in it. Night. I've seen how you look at her and it  isn't right. A split of Moet. Like a wolf. I seen a wolf in everybody I ever  met and I see a wolf in you. You, too. What? Hello, boys and girls. Guess what  happened to me? Where's Ma? You're not sleepy? Pop, I got news. Here. Ti amo. You look tired. I'm getting married. Yeah. The guy died. He got hit by a bus. Johnny Cammareri. He's flying to Sicily. His mother's  dying. In a month. You've got to come. You've got to  give me away. And maybe that's why I had the Bad  Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and  I got married in a church, in a  wedding dress, instead of at the  City Hall with strangers standing  outside the door, maybe then I  wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had. I didn't have no wedding cake, no  reception or nothing. Johnny got  down on his knees and proposed to me  at The Grand Ticino. Yeah. Here. It's temporary. So you'll come to the wedding, right? Who's dead? Again? Johnny Cammareri. You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo.  Do you love him, Loretta? No. Good. When you love them they drive  you crazy cause they know they can.  But you like him? Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna  have a big church wedding, Ma. And a  reception. And who's gonna pay for that? Pop. Father of the bride pays. You're rich as Roosevelt. You're  just cheap, Cosmo. He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks  if he holds on to his money, he will  never die. It's his duty as a father to pay for  my wedding, Ma ... Now he's gonna play that damn Vicki  Carr record. And then when he comes  to bed, he won't touch me. Good morning. I have heard that Johnny Cammareri  got down on his knees in The Grand  Ticino and proposed to her. Don't fight. He should pay. He owes her a wedding from the first  time when there was none. Will you live here? No. Why not? Pop don't like Johnny. So we'll sell the house. I got married before, you didn't  sell. Grandma was still alive. Chiro was  still home going to school. Now he's  married and gone to Florida. If you  and Johnny moved in, had a baby... I'm thirty-seven years old. What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro  after I was thirty-seven. It ain't  over till it's over. Johnny has a big apartment. We'll  live there. And we'll sell the house. I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the  house. But Pop don't like Johnny. No. He don't. Hello? Yea, this is Loretta Castorini -  yeah. Is that you Johnny? How was your plane ride? Quanto tempo devo aspettare? How long must I wait?! Have you told her we're getting  married? Alright. I'll call him. Today. Listen,  Johnny. Call me after you tell your  mother. Alright? Alright. And don't  stand directly under the sun. You've  got your hat, use your hat. Alright.  Bye-bye. How's the mother? She's dying. But I could still hear  her big mouth. Did he tell her? Not yet. That old lady makes him  sweat. Where's that card? Who Are you calling? Cammareri's Bake Shop. Is Ronny there? Hold on. Ronny, the phone! I'm calling for your brother Johnny.  He's getting married and he wants  you to come. He's in Palermo. Let me come and talk to you. Is Ronny Cammareri here? He down at the ovens. What do you  want? I would like to speak to him. Hey, RONNY. Yes. I'm going to marry him. Yes. Do you want... Excuse me. I don't understand. I didn't come here to upset you. No, Ronny! Maybe I should come back another  time. I tell you I won't do it! Oh, Mr. Cammareri! That's the bad blood between you and  Johnny? But that wasn't Johnny's fault. This is the most tormented man I  have ever known. I am in love with  this man. He doesn't know that. I  never told him cause he can never  love anybody since he lost his hand  and his girl. Here. Why don't you just kill him?  It would be so much more kind than  coming here and inviting him to a  wedding like he'll never have. Where you live? Come on. And what did they say? You have such a head for knowing.  You know everything. Oh, Cosmo! You ready for the coffee? I'm making you a steak. I know that. I do what I want. You'll eat this bloody to feed your  blood. Loretta. He knew my husband who died. Bus hit him. Instantaneous. Yesterday. Why what? So. Five years ago your hand got cut  off and your woman left you for  another man. No woman since then? Stupid. Seven years ago. Just Johnny. No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky. What? Do you think you're the only  one ever shed a tear? You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving  me a glass of whiskey? You think so? You really are stupid, you know that. I was raised that a girl gets married  young. I didn't get married until I  was twenty-eight. I met a man. I  loved him. I married him. He wanted  to have a baby right away. I said  no. Then he got hit by a bus. No  man. No baby. No nothing! I did not  know that man was a gift I could not  keep. I didn't know... You tell me a  story and you think you know what it  means, but I see what the true story  is, and you can't. She didn't leave you! You can't see  what you are. I can see everything.  You are a wolf! The big part of you has no words and  it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap  for you. She caught you and you could  not get away. So you chewed off your foot! That  was the price you had to pay to be  free. Johnny had nothing to do with it.  You did what you had to do, between  you and you, and I know I'm right, I  don't care what you say. And now  you're afraid because you found out  the big part of you is a wolf that  has the courage to bite off its own  hand to save itself from the trap of  the wrong love. That's why there has  been no woman since that wrong woman.  You are scared to death what the  wolf will do if you make that mistake  again! I'm telling you your life! No! Because I have no Luck! I am looking where I should to become  a bride! A wolf without a foot! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I have no Luck! Where are you taking me? Oh. Oh God. I don't care about  anything. I don't care about anything!  Take me to the bed. Me neither. I was dead, too. All my life I have never reached a  man. I knew that I would reach my  husband, but I took my time and he  was dead. Ronny. I want to cut you open and crawl  inside of you. I want you to swallow  me. Get all of me. Take everything. You're mad at him, take it out on  me, take your revenge on me! Take  everything, leave nothing for him to  marry! Hollow me out so there's  nothing left but the skin over my  bones. Suck me dry! She must be eating out. It's not like her not to call. Well, she's got a lot on her mind. I mean, can we talk about it, Rose?  Everybody's heard. She's getting  married again. Marriage is happy news. Well, what do you wanna talk about! Why you drinking so much? Old Man, if you give another piece  of my food to those dogs, I'm gonna  kick you till you're dead! Cosmo? You drank too much and now you sleep  too hard, and later you'll be up  when you should be down. What's that? That light. Oh. I've never seen a moon like that. What? What? Oh. What are you talking about, Raymond?  Cosmo can't own the moon. Is who down there? What would he be doing down there? You know, in this light, and with  that expression on your face, you  look about twenty-five years old. Oh my God. What? What have we done? This time I was trying to do  everything right. I thought if I stayed away from the  City Hall, I won't have that Bad  Luck I had again. I'm marrying your brother! You're invited to the wedding! It's  in a few weeks. Why didn't you do  like him and be with your dying mother  in Palermo? You don't get along with anybody! What did I do? That's impossible! It was ruint when  I got here! You ruint my life! Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got  those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why  didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck!  Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why  didn't I just pick up a stone and  kill myself years and years ago? I'm  gonna marry him! Last night never happened, you hear  me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and  last night never happened, and you  and I are gonna take this to our  coffins! Why not? Snap out of it! Alright. Then I must never see you  again. The bad blood will have to  stay there between you and Johnny  for all time. You won't come to the  wedding. I'm telling you you can't. But that's cause he don't know! What? What are you talking about? Alright. Alright. Where's the Met? Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It's been two months since my last  confession. Twice I took the name of God in vain,  once I slept with the brother of my  fiancï¿½, and once I bounced a check  at the liquor store -- but that was  really an accident. I... a... slept with my fiancï¿½'s  brother. I know. I know. Alright. Hi. Where you been? I don't wanna talk about it. Just like your father. I lied to  him. He thinks you came home last  night. Thanks. What's the matter with you? Cosmo's cheating on me. What! How do you know? A wife knows. Then you don't know. You're just  imagining it. He's too old. I won't be home for dinner. Okay, Harvey. So what do you think? About what? The cake! Where's Ronny? How come he ain't  come down? How should I know? Hello, Cammareri's? Hi. Uh-huh. Okay. That was Ronny. He don't feel good.  He ain't gonna be down today. What, is he still upset? It's that bitch! You were a tiger last night. Shut up. They'll hear you in the  back. Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice!  What's got into you? Hi. What's the matter with him? You got me. What about the moon? No. Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the  deposit to the bank but I'll do the  books tomorrow. I gotta go. What are you talking about, you fool?  Her fiancï¿½'s in Palermo. I got things to do. Sure you do. You got all that wedding  stuff. Right. What's the matter? You look crazy. I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita. Don't fight. Don't make yourself sick. Talk to him. Did you see the moon last night? Bye, Aunt Rita. Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow? Yeah, I'll be in. So? You want the usual? I want you to get rid of the grey. I've been wanting to do this for  three years! Let me show you some  magazines! You've got to get a  manicure! And your eyebrows! Sheila!  I'm gonna need help! Ma! Grandpa! No? Okay. Hi. I thought I'd try it. You look good. I said I'd go to the opera with you.  Nothing else. Who painted that? Kinda gaudy. For what? So. Where are we sitting? It's just me. I want to eat. Fine. Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a  martini, no ice and two olives. I'm trying to explain to you how I  feel. Every time I try to explain  how I feel, you explain how you feel.  I don't think that's really much of  a response. Not yet. I'll wave. I really do hate it though, when you  take that tone with me. Like you're  above it all and isn't it amusing. Not to me! This is my life, no matter  how damned comical it may seem to  you. I don't need some man standing  above the struggle while I roll around  in the mud! I'm not disturbed. By you. She was just too young for you. None of your business. Will you join me for dinner? What do you do? That woman was a student of yours? There's old saying my mother told  me. Would you like to hear it? Don't shit where you eat. I'm a housewife. I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you  a question? Why do men chase women? I think it's because they fear death. What you don't know about women is a  lot. They get some turnout for this stuff. I like parts of it, but I don't really  get it. You haven't once said you like my  dress. Why you looking around so much? I'm wearing your bracelet. Sure. Yes. That was just so... awful! Beautiful. Sad. She died! I couldn't believe it! I didn't think  she was going to die. I knew she was  sick... I know. She was coughing her brains  out. And still, she had to sing all  the time... Pop? Pop? What are you doing here? Mona? I got it done. What are you doing here? You're married. You're my father. I don't know whether I saw you or  not. That wasn't my mother. That's my house. Yes. It's a house. He's a plumber. Yes. No. No. I think the house is empty. I  can't invite you in because I'm  married and because I know who I am. You're shaking. You're a little boy and you like to  be bad. I'm too old for you. Good night. Sure. Good night. No thanks. I wanna go home. It's really cold. My mother guessed that my father was  seeing somebody and I told her she  was crazy. She looked like a real  piece of cheap goods. But who am I  to talk? How can you ask me that? You are guilty. I'm guilty. I know what I know. He didn't come! You're late! This is your place. This is where we're going! The deal was if I came to the Opera  with you you'd leave me alone forever. I went with you. Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're  gonna leave me alone. Right? A person can see where they've messed  up in their life, and they can change  how they do things, and they can  change their Luck. Maybe my nature  does draw me to you, but I don't  haveta go with that. I can take hold  of myself and say yes to some things  and no to something that's just gonna  ruin everything! I can do that.  Otherwise, what is this stupid life  that God gave us for what? Ronny? Are you listening to me? I'm really afraid. I'm afraid of who I am. And you're not now? Why not? Let me go home. Let me go home. I'm freezing to death. Moving in? Come on in. She's not home yet. Take off your  coat and come in the living room.  I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk  to you. So. Out. I don't know where. I was waiting  up for my husband. Yes. What are you doing here? You're  supposed to be in Palermo. A miracle. Well, that's news. You're kidding? That's incredible. Hello Pop. That was my father-in-law, who has a  wrong idea in his head. Listen,  Johnny, there's a question I want to  ask you. And I want you to tell me  the truth if you can. Why do men  chase women? But why would a man need more than  one woman? That's it! That's the reason! No, that's really it. Thank you for  answering my question. Where you been? Cosmo? I just want you to know. No matter  what you do. You are going to die,  just like everybody else. You're welcome. He doesn't like you. Thank you for  answering my question. No idea. Okay, I'll tell her. What the hell happened to you? Well. I don't really know where to  start. Your hair's different. Everything's different. Are you drunk? No. Are you drunk? No. But I have a hangover. Where's pop? Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up  last night. What? He's in Sicily! No more he's not. He's with his dying mother! She recovered. WHAT!! She was dying! It was a miracle. A miracle? This is modern times!  There ain't supposed to be miracles  any more! I guess it ain't modern times in  Sicily. He came right from the  airport. He wanted to talk to you.  You got a love bite on your neck.  He's coming back this morning. It's not Johnny. Ronny! He's coming. Nice to meet you. You've got a love  bite on your neck. Your mother's  recovered from death. You've gotta get outta here. Ronny, please... Would anyone like some oatmeal? Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's  brother. Have I been a good wife? I want you to stop seeing her. And go to confession. Your life is not built on nothing.  Ti amo. It's Johnny. I'll get it. I'll get it. No, I'll tell him. What am I going to tell him? I love you Pop. Hi Loretta. Hi. Hi. Why ain't you at the store? Is there anything you want to tell  us, honey? You? No. The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO She's got it. We didn't know what to think. You  were so weird yesterday, and then  this morning, we go to the bank and  no bag. Listen. Who wants coffee? So what are we doing? We're waiting for Johnny Cammareri. I'll get it. I'm getting palpitations! It's Johnny Cammareri. Johnny. I don't know. But Johnny, how did  your mother recover? She was dying. I can't. I need my family around me  now. Johnny, I have something to tell  you. I have no secrets from my family. WHAT? What the hell are you talking about?  We're engaged. I'm talking about a promise. You  proposed to me! And you're a big liar! I've got your  ring here! Here! Take your stupid pinky ring. Who needs it? The engagement's off. In time, you will drop dead, and I  will come to your funeral in a red  dress. What! Where's the ring? Before all these people, yes, I will  marry you, Ronny Cammareri! Do you love him, Loretta? Yeah, Ma, I love him awful. Oh God, that's too bad. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Ti amo.
