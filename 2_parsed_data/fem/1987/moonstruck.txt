Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened. The Shawfish? Oh, you're not going. You're staying.I don't know whether I saw you or not. You're my father. You're married. What are you doing here? I got it done. Mona? So you'll come to the wedding, right? It's temporary. Here. Yeah. I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino. And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had. You've got to come. You've got to give me away. In a month. He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying. Johnny Cammareri. He got hit by a bus. The guy died. Yeah. I'm getting married. You look tired. Here. Ti amo. Pop, I got news. You're not sleepy? Where's Ma? Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri! What! I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me! What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged. No, I'll tell him. What am I going to tell him? Ronny, please... You've gotta get outta here. He's coming. Ronny! I'm freezing to death. Let me go home. Let me go home. Why not? And you're not now? I'm afraid of who I am. I'm really afraid. I went with you. Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone. Right? A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what? Ronny? Are you listening to me? The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever. This is where we're going! This is your place. You're late! He didn't come! I know what I know. You are guilty. I'm guilty. How can you ask me that? It's really cold. I wanna go home. No thanks. I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick... Beautiful. Sad. She died! That was just so... awful! I like parts of it, but I don't really get it. They get some turnout for this stuff. So. Where are we sitting? For what? Kinda gaudy. Who painted that? I thought I'd try it. You look good. Hi. Alright. Where's the Met? Alright. What are you talking about? What? But that's cause he don't know! I'm telling you you can't. Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding. Snap out of it! Why not? Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins! Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him! That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life! What did I do? You don't get along with anybody! You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo? I'm marrying your brother! I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again. This time I was trying to do everything right. What? What have we done? Oh my God. I've never seen a moon like that. That light. You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry! Get all of me. Take everything. I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me. All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny. I was dead, too. Me neither. Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed. Where are you taking me? A wolf without a foot! I am looking where I should to become a bride! Because I have no Luck! No! I'm telling you your life! The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away. So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free. Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again! I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't. She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf! You really are stupid, you know that. You think so? You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey? What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear? No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky. Just Johnny. Seven years ago. Stupid. So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then? Why what? Yesterday. Instantaneous. Bus hit him. He knew my husband who died. Loretta. You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood. I know that. I do what I want. I'm making you a steak. But that wasn't Johnny's fault. That's the bad blood between you and Johnny? Maybe I should come back another time. I don't understand. Excuse me. Yes. Do you want... I'm going to marry him. Yes. Let me come and talk to you. He's in Palermo. I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come. Johnny. You? No. Hi. Yeah, I'll be in. Bye, Aunt Rita. I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita. Right. I got things to do. Where's the ring? In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress. And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here! WHAT? I have no secrets from my family. Johnny, I have something to tell you. I can't. I need my family around me now. I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying. Have you told her we're getting married? How was your plane ride? Sure. You have a brother? Who is he? You've made me very happy, Johnny. I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up. A month from today? Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set. How about a month from today? Then let's set the date. How near is she to death? What about the wedding? So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time. What time is it? You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement. I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down. Yes, on the floor. Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down? We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage. You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck. Are you proposing marriage to me? Bobo, take the cart away. What? I shouldn't. What's the matter? You never have dessert. She was too young for him. Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too. It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride. You don't want the fish. Yeah, Ma, I love him awful. A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more! WHAT!! She was dying! He's with his dying mother! What? He's in Sicily! Where's pop? No. Are you drunk? Everything's different. Well. I don't really know where to start. Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old. What! How do you know? Thanks. What's the matter with you? I don't wanna talk about it. Hi. Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat. Where's that card? She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth. I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny. Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there. I'm thirty-seven years old. I got married before, you didn't sell. Pop don't like Johnny. No. Pop. Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception. No. The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT! Hi. Why ain't you at the store? Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go. No. What about the moon? What's the matter with him? Hi. Alright. I know. I know. I... a... slept with my fianc�'s brother. Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc�, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.Did you see the moon last night? Talk to him. Don't make yourself sick. Don't fight. He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none. He should pay. Don't fight. I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.I'm wearing your bracelet. Why you looking around so much? You haven't once said you like my dress. Oh, Cosmo! You have such a head for knowing. You know everything. And what did they say?It's Johnny Cammareri. Is there anything you want to tell us, honey? Hi Loretta. Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow? What's the matter? You look crazy. Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff. We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag. She's got it. What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc�'s in Palermo. You got me. Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you? Shut up. They'll hear you in the back. You were a tiger last night. You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old. What would he be doing down there? Is who down there? What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon. Oh. What? What? Marriage is happy news.Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo. And go to confession. I want you to stop seeing her. Have I been a good wife? Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother. You're welcome. I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else. Cosmo? Where you been? Why you drinking so much? Well, what do you wanna talk about! He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die. You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo. You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta? Again? Johnny Cammareri. Who's dead? Oh God, that's too bad. Do you love him, Loretta? I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning. It was a miracle. She recovered. No more he's not. Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night. No. But I have a hangover. Are you drunk? Your hair's different. What the hell happened to you? A wife knows. Cosmo's cheating on me. Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night. Where you been? Did he tell her? How's the mother? No. He don't. And we'll sell the house. What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over. Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby... So we'll sell the house. Why not? Will you live here? And who's gonna pay for that? Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him? Okay, I'll tell her. No idea. He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question. No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question. That's it! That's the reason! But why would a man need more than one woman? That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women? That's incredible. You're kidding? A miracle. Well, that's news. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo. Yes. Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband. So. She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you. Come on in. Moving in? Good night. Sure. Good night. I'm too old for you. You're a little boy and you like to be bad. No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking. No. Yes. Yes. Sure. What you don't know about women is a lot. I think it's because they fear death. Why do men chase women? I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question? I'm a housewife. Don't shit where you eat. There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it? That woman was a student of yours? What do you do? Will you join me for dinner? None of your business. She was just too young for you. I'm not disturbed. By you.He's a plumber. It's a house. Yes. That's my house.
