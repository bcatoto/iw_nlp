Yes, I did. Yes, you can make sandwiches.... Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee.... You're welcome. I was the one who cried. Did you hear what I said? Come inside.... Not today. Come on, Thea.... Come on, sweetheart.... It has its virtues. It hasn't fallen down yet.... Don't bother Hoagie.... Thea.... You'll spoil her. Why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you tell us? I don't know.... How could you do that? Your own daughter.... She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think.... You knew...? The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock.... Thea was attacked by a shark.... Where have you been...? Close the door. I have work.... No.... Then don't come any closer. I don't know...You...I don't know. We don't have anything straightened out. You're uptight about something ...what's wrong? Because.... Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap. I'm trying to get ready for.... It doesn't take much to remember what day they come.... Tell Matt he should be here.... We need beer.... We need milk.... We forgot to stop at the store. It sure is good to be home.... Like mother, like son.... Chicken.... I've always wanted to ride one of those.... What do I think? I think it's a lovely idea.... Where are you going? He was doing his job.... He told me you both did.... We'll be there.... Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you.... Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens. Whatever happens next..... It's beginning.... At least he doesn't have a beard.... You want to try your hand at something...? You're not interfering, Ellen.... Henny Youngman.... I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub.... Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry.... I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished.... It'll grow on you. No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....You make sure they come? We will...We'll have a lot of time together. What are you going to do now? I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it... It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.... Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me.... I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious.... Beginning of what? All he did was kiss me.... Do you enjoy dealing blackjack? I'd be afraid of losing.... You caught me.... I shouldn't interfere... My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock.... I can't help it.... Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...? About spending so much time working in the water? I like it. Really.... I'm not on vacation.... Don't be late. A small one...Your brother won't be here.... He heard that. I'm on the phone.... The fish. Check it.... Hello? Thea who? I know it's Thea Brody. How many grandchildren do I have? I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl. I know you're five. Are you all right? Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers.... I see what you're doing.... Serves you right. Will you please stop.... That.... Stop that.... I'll miss you.... I'll be in to read you a story. Thanks for the consultation.... I almost forgot.... What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...? No one. Nothing. We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in. You're coming, aren't you...? We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it.... Your father was six then. Just like you.... No, no...It's too dangerous.... Thank you.... I never.... It's too dangerous.... I'd like that. I need to be away from here. Yes! In a minute.... We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael.... Promise me.... I want you all to come to Amity this summer. Why'd you come out here? You hungry? It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe. You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity.... I'm your mother. It's my job.... I'm worried.. We haven't had our.... I'm leaving in a few days. I don't want to do that with you unhappy.... You and Sean used to make.... You look tired.... It's late.... Children are never satisfied. I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael. I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back. Now show your mother what a good dancer you are. No more sharks. I'll stay for another week, then.... That's it? Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne.... It's not easy. None of it is. I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try. I finally figured that out. I'm going to do my best.... Will you let me finish. I've been working on this all day. I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work.... He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous.... I enjoy his company.... I am. You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water.... You could teach...You could.... I want you to give up your work.... Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window.... I'll be all right, Michael. We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go. How are you doing? I'm fine.... You were a monkey.... I didn't mean to start that.... Oh, I didn't mean.... I'm being such a Grandma.... Oh, it looks like my uncle's. He taught me how to sail when I was a kid.... Your brother's dead...Your father's dead.... He died from fear...From having to go out there after it.... It picked Sean...It killed your father.... I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water.... Never again...Never.... I don't want you in the water anymore.... You're damn right I'm serious.... I want you to give up that terrible job. I want you to get out of the water.... You guys must be starving.... It came for him. It waited all this time and it came for him.... I can't.... I tried to tell you...I tried.... You sure you don't need glasses? The whole idea is preposterous.... I'm sorry...I.... Why? There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go.... Won't you get in trouble...? What? You're always taking time off.... That's hard to imagine.... I have my own little island. Good. I have two left.... You'll be sorry. No! You're not going to bet it all.... A big one.... The kind with an umbrella in it.... You promised me a drink.... I'm terrific... Come on.... I'm fine. Nothing.... It's wonderful.... The plane's turning.... You're impossible.... You're not going to tell me, are you? I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair.... Where do I pull off...? What are you doing? I don't know how.... I can't.... How can you just take the plane like this? Doesn't matter.... When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart. I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that. I know it's coming.... It was no accident.... Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares.... I...I can't explain it. It's just something I feel. I don't know why I've told you all this. I hardly know you. Flies the plane.... Can you just go off...? You must get bored easily. No....When he has a pillow over his head.... I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that.... I'm training to.... I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair. Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight.... Oh, Jake... I told you.... Here comes the cow ca-ca.... Here it comes.... In a few minutes.... Don't flatter yourself....Deputy Brody will take care of it personally. Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows. They're not giving milk. Gone to Ben Masters' place. Cow tipping. That man keeps calling about his training film. I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team. You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow.... We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....It's time for tea, Grandma. You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people.... Can I make sandwiches...? My tea set. I got my tea set. Thank you.... Was Uncle Sean ever bad? Did you ever spank him? I don't want to. I want to swing.... Daddy, why can't I...? But you always let me.... Watch me, Grandma.... Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep. That's what grandmas are for. I will. I'll miss you, Grandma. Good night, Daddy.... I put everything in my room. My Teddy bear is joining us. I didn't. The water's coming in...The water's coming in.... It's not nice to be evasive. Who's coming? You're silly.... I'm still five.... Mommy lets me.... I like Grandma's cooking.... Where's the lady who brings the soda? Can I ride one sometime...? You can stay in my room. What's going on? Yes I can.... Hurry! I'm the artist. Like my mother. You're the man who drives the plane. I do.... How come it bumps up and down when there's no road? I'm too young for coffee. Can I drive the plane? They had them on the big one....
