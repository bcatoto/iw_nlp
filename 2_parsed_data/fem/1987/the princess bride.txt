Then why is there fear behind your eyes? I do not marry tonight. Should I be? Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth. Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear. You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway. Every ship but the four you sent. Every ship but your four fastest, you mean. He will come for me. My Westley will always come for me. He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship. If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man? Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done? You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day! And what am I? Nothing you can say will upset me. You mock my pain! On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners. You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces. You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it. I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything. I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream. He knows I do not love him. I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know. I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you... To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned. Who are you? Well, no, we sort of skipped that part. But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife." What? I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast. Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me? At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?" Oh, Westley, darling. Westley, why won't you hold me? We did it. Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s? We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here. What? -- go on -- But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago? You? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58. We'll never survive. I will never doubt again. Well ... you were dead. Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly. But how can you be sure? But what if something happens to you? I fear I'll never see you again. Farm Boy. Fill these with water -- --please. Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.Okay. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97. That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job. Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do. Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth. Your first story was better. Where's that bellows? He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him. Are you a rotten liar. Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93. Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money? Hah? He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in. Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle. The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed! What? What? It would take a miracle. Bye! Have fun storming the castle. A good hour. Yeah. An hour. Nobody's hearing nothing! I'm not listening. Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name -- Don't say another word, Valerie. You never had it so good. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95. -- get back, witch --Maybe he won't. You are sick, that's why he's here. Your grandfather's here. Guess what. You feeling any better?Bye. Think it'll work? Bye-bye, boys. Yeah, an hour. The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what? Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck! A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help -- What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered. "True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God -- I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.The gate has but one key, and I carry that. The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate. It won't be easy, Sire. Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate. My spy network has heard no such news. Sire.
