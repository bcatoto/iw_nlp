Thank you Billy, from the baby and me. You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays? That's not the point. Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic. I'm starting my own collection. They've got the real thing outside. Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow. The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us. You're the biggest fibber. He's the worst liar. You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you! You do, you do. You're just not saying. Where? What is it? Air-raid? Don't be so cheeky, Bruce. They might be. A bit too quick. Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt. It looks a bit fishy to me. It's not. It's happening to me. Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that. He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break. He's being posted. I was terrible to him. Who said anything about love? I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him. No, I won't. Out. It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up. That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there. Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me. Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here? What would we do if a German came into the house? He always knows. After this dance. You know it? It must be an old one. This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer. I've had a letter from her. They've moved house. When do you think you'll get leave again? What are you going to be then? Why didn't they say that before you started? You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission? You taste it. It looks....foreign. How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam. They could poison half the country. We don't know anything about it And what's that? I wish you could have told me yourself. Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas. You joined up. Has Sue got it right? And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card. They'd gone. No Turks. Now take deep breaths, and push. Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think? I don't believe this is happening to me. I think it's very sensible in the circumstances. What did he say? Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride. What is it, pet? You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life. There, there, my baby. You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick. And where do you think you're going? I won't have this vulgar talk in my house. The ideas you get in your head. Don't be silly, Dawn. Half the time he's bluffing. Ancient. Have you finished your homework? Just ignore her, Mac. I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning. Wasn't it lovely? Up to six weeks, I think. No, Mother! It's War! War! I wish it could all have been different. Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you? We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac. This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back. He could always make me laugh. You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking. And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did. Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back. Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with? Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together. That's right. Not since then Not since I got married. Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since... It seems to have survived. Please yourself. Let them go, if they want. I can't do it. What's the point? It was the best time of his life. And now we're glad you did. How long? What did I do to deserve this? Father, that's enough now I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again. You've been drinking. Your tipsy. You're having me on, Molly. Molly! You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really. I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor. I know you mean well. It's so far way. I couldn't bear it. My aunt in Australia has offered.....such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls. How are we going to cope? Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace? Or what? Is it peace in out time?Happy as can be. In the old groove. Tipsy, topsy, turvy. Am I? Maybe I am. Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights. I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own. God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor. I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong? Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself. It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how. Who with? I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about. We thought it was poison. Tell them about Pauline's mum. Ask her yourself. You couldn't. You wouldn't. He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
