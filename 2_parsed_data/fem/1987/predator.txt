You touch me again, pig, and I will cut off your balls! When my people catch you, you'll wish you were him. Look out, behind you!!! I don't know what it was. It... It changes colors, like the chameleon.  It uses the jungle... Anna. There is something else.  When the big man was killed, you must have wounded it. It's blood was on the leaves. When I was little we find a man -- -- like a butcher.  The old ones in the village cross themselves and whisper crazy things.  'Demonio, cazador de trofoes...Only the hottest times of the hottest years...'  Crazy things...This year is grows hot.  And we begin finding our men.  We find them sometimes without their skin. Sometimes...much, much worse.  Cazador de trofoes...means the demon who takes trophies. NOOOOOO!!!!!!
