Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug. It's getting too cold even for me, Nick. All right, how's the new partner? You'll take care of that. If you give me one. I wasn't expecting you. Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout. Hello, Ich.  Johnny Walker? He gets as much as he wants. Right when you're being tucked into bed. They wouldn't appreciate it, Ich. Trust me. You don't speak the language.  I'll drop him off. Ich said you left. I'm sorry about your friend. Dead gaiijin's are big news. An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me. More you. I don't give tours. You have a helluva way of asking for help. Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs. I don't think so. Busy man. It's me. What's the latest? She ever pull down her shades? Don't be an ass. I paid for that. Sit, sweetie. Another Seagrams! Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice. Where's Ich? I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood. My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in. And I'm supposed to care? You're wrong to sell Ich short. He's got a reason. His son hooked up with some bikers. Yakuza kids.  A cop shot him running from a robbery. A father doesn't out live that kind of thing here, much less a police officer... You met her. The woman in the apartment.  She won't speak to him.  But she won't leave either.  Japan... Nice, huh? Not wound too tight... I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense. I chant. 'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course. I don't remember saying yes. They want your autograph. This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson... They'll never go away. Mick Jagger? Gifts are expected here. All's not lost.  There's a famous temple here.  We could chant. The cheese... Just you. I'll spare you the ritual. Pick it up.  Look at it. Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin. -- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant. I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun. He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired. He'll be dealt with. Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us. Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them. Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar. Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be? The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me. I'll pay you. Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police. You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it. Slide over. You came up with the first part. Kobo will meet me here tomorrow. Ten a.m. He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance. You're out of your mind.  I'm leaving. You'll get Ich killed. Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not. Bastard... Let go. You're out of your mind. I still think you're a bastard. Wouldn't help. Watch out for Ich. Contact your associate in New York and tell him to hand my plate over to Abolofia. You have betrayed the syndicate and personally dishonored me.  I would rather the deal fell through than... Abolofia's person has received the plate.  It's done. I wanted you to see him like this. Let him go, father. You're too old... That's enough. You want him dead too. If anything happens to Abolofia or my plate, detective... Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head. Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
