Yes. Don�t Jim. All ten million. Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here. Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why.. You knew about Jim? Krieger. Krieger can get it. Right? Always. It�s all right, Ethan..you�ll bring me back...won�t you... This stuff is so sticky. Ethan? Ethan�s right behind me. Listen to me Jim. Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money. Ethan takes the blame. No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him. Two cars. Where are you? Ethan...Kittridge is on the train. Yes.......come here....viens pres moi... Okay... What happened? What are you going to do? Bastard! I'm going to try and get some sleep. I'm so sorry. Krieger was my call. I've never worked with him. I'm sorry, Ethan. What about you? You didn't have to......... You don't think we're going to make it. Sure... What kind of help? Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him. I want to get the son of a bitch who did this. We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you. Max made a deal with you? The message is for Job. Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do... What are you going to do? Why haven't they brought us in yet? No one sent me! We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --! Who is they, who is they? Who is "they?" I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so I walked away. What? They're dead. Jim's dead. What happened to Jim? What happened to Jim? No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge. I wasn't. I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio. He said someone was... Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay. It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you? Roger that. Oh yeah? Are you all right Ethan. What's wrong with you? Sleeping's better. I'm walking. I want to sleep. Can I sleep here. Did we get it?I wouldn�t worry about him. Once you�ve got the money -- he�ll find you. The possibility alone is worth ten million. Baggage car, rack 3. Silver briefcase. Combination 314. Ha, dear boy! I do hope this doesn�t prelude a meeting in private. I'm going to have to front you personally. Don't lose that money without losing your life. How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days? It's been a delight. Now where can I drop you dear boy? Done. Bring it to me in London. I want it by the end of the week. Six million dollars. I'll give you the same. But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe. I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous. I want the entire list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world. I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket. My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan. Obviously it didn't pass muster. Deal's off. Very good. Mm - Hmmm... It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir. Why should I? I don't know Job any more than he knows me. Why, may I ask? Ah, but, we're asking about you. And how might you know that? Are you another Company man? It's quite out of the question. On what? The penny drops. You are not Job. Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful. Job is not playful. So you're something of a paradox. Really? And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you? Who are you and what are you doing here? Phew! We�ve got five minutes... Run it through from the top. Is something wrong with the phone? Well is something wrong with the batteries? Try it again. What�s the problem. This wasn�t what we discussed. How long until we reach the Chunnel? Doesn't mean it's a signal. Could just be the hard drive heating up. That's not so good for you, my friend.Jim gave an abort, we should walk away. Ethan. He�s out of pocket. The package is in the open. What about my coat? I'll freeze. Higher. Such a nice ass. I think I might just take that look. Jack you're so wicked. Jack...that's spying. I don't know. Loud and clear. Of course I can hear you.
