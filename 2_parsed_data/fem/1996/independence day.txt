This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin. We're going with you. I mean, we're going too. It's really nice of you to help us.You bet it did. Are you all right? With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission? Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close? I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special? He's a good man. I take it you've heard. David, don't... I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President. What do you want me to do? And when is the countdown supposed to expire? David? How'd you get this number? What? You're being paranoid. In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here. This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion. What do you want? Love was never our problem. Spunky. He told you about that? He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two. My ex-husband works in satellite communications. David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't. We're losing them. You saved a lot of lives. I'll bet. I don't know how you put up with him. More than likely.Dick-weed. You scared the hell out of me. Sorry for what? I know, you like to make a big entrance. You're late. You're late. Dick-weed! You know, you're not as charming as you think you are. Really? You don't mind? Be careful. Wait. I have to tell you something. You said you were on leave for the Fourth. You can't go. Call them back. He's trying to impress you. Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy. Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady. Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future. Guess it doesn't really matter anymore. Don't be. I'm not. It's good money. 'Side, he's worth it. No. Exotic. I'm a dancer. He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though. He's my angel.I thought you didn't recognize me. And when the dancing's over? What about your future? Oh. Sorry. Really? Ballet? So, what do you do for a living? Was his father stationed here? Your son.
