My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy? You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us. Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff? Wait a minute. All right. Hold on. We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead. My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head? Can you land? Somebody get off! See you in hell, Snake. No, that sucks. How are we getting out? I don't know, sounds thin to me. So what's the deal, gorgeous? Dream on, blue eye. I see your point. What's the favor? All right, so I made another deal. I was called away on urgent business, Snake. Not anymore. What's in it for me?Run, Snake...They're coming. No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte. What are you gonna do in Venice? It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep. The freeway. I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going. I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave. Snake - what is it? Sewers. Come on. Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings. I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace. You need help. The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills. Oh no, it's the Doctor. They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again. Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive. A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake. Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
