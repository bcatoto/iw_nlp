Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips. No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples. You'll find a girl there. Your leg will be fine. A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces. How are you? I can get in the back. Buon' giorno. What's happened? Kip! What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody. I think that's called looting. Where did you find that? Please don't creep around this house. I don't know what that means. What? How could he have? When? Ask him. I'm not in love with him. I'm in love with ghosts. And so is he. He's in love with ghosts. Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me. What do you do? What are you doing here? It's a week. We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or - I could help you. I could get you off that. Where've you been? Because we're fine here. I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at. If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go. So you can shoot a pistol? So was my Patient. You were in Africa? Bonjour. What do you want? Never heard of it. Would you like me to? You'd better be. Hey! - I don't think it does. Anyway, he's indifferent to me. Arguing about books. Kip's another one. Good morning. Did you know that? You're always singing? They have to clear all the local roads of mines. That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden. With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy. I liked it better when there were just the two of us. My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano. I'll probably marry him. He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him. He's Indian, he wears a turban. Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace. New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire� I love that, I believe that. Who is K? Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him. He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him? Do you recognize him? He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it. This is Captain McGann. Thank you. Thank you. No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get. He's going back to the front this evening. I can't see him otherwise. Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes? Excuse me - He won't disturb us then. I think he's after morphine. There's a war. Where you come from becomes important. And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices. He needn't disturb you. He's Canadian. There's a man downstairs. He brought us eggs. He might stay. Because I'm a nurse. Are you crazy? Are you remembering more? No sand. That's your drugs speaking. I'm turning you. How? How can you see anything? I should try and move your bed. I want you to be able to see the view. It's good, it's a view from a monastery. Are you asleep? When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure� Candaules�you're laughing at me. I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word. Oh - I've found plums. We have plums in the orchard. We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth. I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book? I was repairing the stairs. I found a library and the books were very useful. Because you're leaning? No, you're just on an angle. You're too heavy! I'm not sewing anything else for you! No! I'm not sewing anything else. So one day we'll meet. I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting. I've clung to you. I've clung to you. Kip. Life a raft. I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin. And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can. A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us. Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think? Kip� I - Of course. When? Nya-nya-nya! I should go to the house, get breakfast. What are you up to? You wouldn't come to find me? That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban. But if it got late and I hadn't shown up? If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do? You loved him. Kip - come and dance with me Don't go. I'm frightened. I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man. Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case. Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over. Give me the pliers. I'm not scared. So many people have died around me. But I would be a shame for us. I don't feel like being shy. I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die. Why would anyone do this? I follow the wires. So I follow the wires? What do I do? It's okay - I'll help. Please. I didn't like that book either. It's all about men. Too many men. Just like this house. Yes, for your hair. Try this. I found a great jar of it. Olive oil. In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife. I don't think so. No, but, no, not at all. I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and - - such good manners for someone worried about mines. That's all. I see. Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach. He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles. Excuse me. Yes? I don't have the key to that door. Oh God. Oh God. He's gone, hasn't he? Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver. Why Picton? He can't even move. I need morphine. A lot. And a pistol. When he dies I'll catch up. The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion? What if you couldn't find him�? Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning. Does he have to go? I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine? He's sleeping. You saved my life. I haven't forgotten. I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance. Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please. I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever� you and Lieutenant Singh� Hello. I thought that was for when we were very very old? I was looking forward to this evening. You've got a mustache. I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed. Sorry. I took a Benzedrine.Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France. The Devil's Chimney it was called - The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why. Darling. My darling. I know. Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead. Do you promise? I wouldn't want to die here. I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns. Very English. And I know exactly where I want to be buried. In our garden. Where I grew up. With a view of the sea. So promise me you'll come back for you. Oh dear. Shall we be all right? Don't leave me! It's so cold. Of course. You idiot. I always wear it. I've always worn it. I've always loved you. You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk. Don't you know you drove everybody mad? Why did you hate me? It hurts too much. Please don't move me. It hurts too much. A surprise, he said. I can't move. I can't get out. Do you think you're the only one who feels anything? Is that what you think? No. You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists Don't do this. Would you let me pass? What? You will. You will. I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him. I'd better get back. Say goodbye here. Shall we be all right? That day, had you followed me to the market? This is a different world - is what I tell myself. A different life. And here I am a different wife. I thought we were against ownership? I can stay tonight. You bastard, I was believing you! It's beautiful. What's it about? Arabic? This is - what is this? This is empty, just coming! No. What? No! A lie. What do you hate most? Marmite - addicted! Baths - not with other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day. My husband. Alm�sy nods. What do I love? I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths. Now. Now. A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it. Close your eyes. You sew very badly. I'm impressed you can sew. Don't. Will you please come in? Will you not come in? Do they know them? No, the marriage isn't a fiction. Geoffrey's not in Cairo. He's not actually a buffoon. And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government. They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia. In case you were counting on his sudden appearance. Find that plant. Cut out its heart. Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have? Oh my God, the others! Fiction. We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on. More. Yes is a comfort. Absolutely is not. Shall we be all right? This is not very good, is it? They're so untidy. I'm just trying to rearrange them. What am I looking at? I'm quite all right, thank you. And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes. Of course it would. I'd like you to have them. I thought you might paste them into your book. Ask Al Auf. Alm�sy asks Al Auf in Arabic. You sing. All the time. Actually, you sing. Be careful? You mean you - or me? Who? What is he saying? Come on, what did he say? Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the Ostrich come in? What do you mean, poetry? So why follow me? Escort me, by all means. Following me is predatory, isn't it? You felt obliged to. After the market, you followed me to the hotel. Why did you follow me yesterday? Excuse me. I don't believe that. I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market? I don't care to bargain. I don't want to go back. Excuse me? Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why? Hello! Good morning. Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women. Do you all know this story? I can't sing. but I can tell a story. I might need a prompt. Do you have your Herodotus? I've noticed you carry it� Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms? I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives. What? Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise. Can't we really go home? I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow. If you wanted. Aren't you? I'm not pregnant. I'm hot. I'm too hot. I'm fine. I got hot. Oh. Why do you think? About my staying? Darling, for goodness' sake! Oh really? But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him. And hearing his story, she said this - I insist. There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts. Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic. Darling, Peter says I could stay� How awful. What will you do? Not at all. I was thoroughly enjoying by book. Please. Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann. It doesn't matter. Really. I think I can muddle through. Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife - One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior - No, please. I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Alm�sy, who doesn't look up from his book. I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes. I don't think so. Coming. I can't sleep. I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.I'll come with you. How romantic. With Fiona I fell over every five minutes. Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall. You should sit down, darling. She's quite all right. Are you pregnant? Katharine!
