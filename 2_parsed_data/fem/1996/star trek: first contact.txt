I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not. You want some advice? Don't do this again. You know exactly what I mean. That might not be so bad... at least for you. You think they're still up there? He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed. Any word from the Enterprise? But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain. It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread... I'll be fine. He's a different story. That'll be interesting. He's stable... for now. But it would be better if we could contact... our friends. There must be some good people... even in this time. Are you saying they won't help us? What are we waiting for? Let's go. Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now. I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship. Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place? But he's been dead for three hundred... Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we? Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive? Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here? Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we -- The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones... His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator. Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one? At least four hours.Do it. Can you configure it? Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons. Vulcan? And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind. ... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again... Isn't it better like this...? I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now. Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always. A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me? I'm your creator now. Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh? More lies. You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie. Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try? They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny... What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift. Do you know what this is, Data? That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet. You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel? Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh? Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you. Don't stop now. Why? I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you. It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm. I knew you weren't from around here. Where? And don't tell me San Francisco... You're leaving, aren't you? And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes. For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship. Or...? All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning? Lie. That's one. Keep going. Friends from Cornell... We? Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house. Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk. Too bad. Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies. I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow. No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be. You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me. You're lying. 'Fraid not. Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer. Who are you? And how do you know Zephram? You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet? "Money." So you can get dome money... Bed sheets. I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years. Did you need something? Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up. Thank God this plate was already fixed. What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on? Take care of him. He's a very special man.I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg. I am the Borg. You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time. But now... they are all one with the Borg.
