Mommy, the men on the mountain...! Shhhh. Gone, all gone now. I'm here. Mommy's always here and no  one can ever hurt you. Safe now...  safe and warm... snug as a bug in a  rug. I'll sit with you, think you can  sleep? Turn on the nightlight. Close your eyes now. I love you. How you holdin' up? *Put that away*. I can't take it, Earl, this dumb  costume is giving me a wedgie. Driving  me crazy, but there's these *kids*  here -- In front of little Billy, age four,  yeah. "Look, Mommy, Mrs. Claus chooses  to go butt-mining." Age four, kid's unbelievable. I'm too old for this, Earl. Say that a little louder, there's a  kid in back didn't catch it. Eight years. I keep hiring detectives,  but they never find anything. I was born 3000 days ago on the beach  in New Jersey. I entered the world  fully grown, wearing clothes I don't  remember buying. Nothing in the  pockets but a single key, filed  smooth. I'm married now. Nice guy, early  forties. I stand naked in the mirror  and try to guess my age. Thirty-five,  maybe. I have lots of scars. Hal, I gotta tell you, of all the  Christmas pageants I've seen, this  was by far the most recent. Teenage boys? Just fine? Come on, it was ground  breaking stuff. The first Nativity  where Joseph stares at the wise men's  tits all night. Hey, you! Her name is Caitlin. She's my daughter  and when I woke up on that long-ago  day, she was two months grown in my  belly. I don't know who put her there.  I may never. I just know she's mine,  and she's about to turn eight. 3000 days. I teach now, fifth grade.  I have the key, I wear it around my  neck for luck. Except for that, and  my name, all traces of my prior life  are lost. Was I in love ever...? Did someone  look in my eyes, did I say, "Darling,  I'll never forget you...?" Because fuck me, darling, I managed. His name is Mr. Perkins, my Mom named  him for me. That's her? That's who? Her Mom, she's got amnesia. Swear? Swear. Too weird. Excuse me. Hello, girls. Caitlin, I'm going to  help Dad with the refreshments. Which one's Dad? I forget. *Kidding*. We gotta stop using bums. It was embarrassing. Uh-huh. So, when they puke all over  you is that, like, a refund? That's funny, there's a cheap suit  all over him like a cheap suit. This is all I ever wanted. How would you know? Stick our fingers in out hands and  pull them out again? Every chance we  get. Shut your piehole. Earl, do me a favor. Every few words  say "hic" and have bubbles come out  your mouth, okay? I want a cigarette, why do I want a  cigarette...? What... what do you want...? I don't smoke. I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things are  coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I  know it. Daddy, make her stop! Hush. Go to the garage and get me  something, anything. A veggie, go,  man, go! I'm hot to trot. Tomato. More. Faster. Tomato. Tomato. Tomato. Uh... chefs do that. They were on sale. *Allez, Gumby etiriait le cou, fils  de pute*. I speak French. You bet your life, fluent French,  whatever the fuck that means. Quand j'�tais a l'ecole, Jai eu un  professeur qui s'est fabriqu� du  dentifrice! Right, he was, you got a problem  with that? Pasty Joe, we called him.  Look, the accent's perfect, so piss  off. I'M A FRENCH CHEF, YA-HOO. Put Perkins in the basket. He's luck. Mr. Perkins, going in the basket. Are the training wheels off? Just pretend they're still there.  Piece of cake. You can do it. Wait...! I'm scared. Shhh. Nothing to be scared of. Pretend  you're one of the X-men, you're tough.  Let's go, now. Three, two, one... Mom, I can't do it, swear -- Ouch--! I can't do it, it HURTS-! Nonsense. You can do it. You don't  want to, but you can. My arm hurts, please take me home...! You can go home, Caitlin. You can  ride there. Mom, no...! Look, I know you're afraid, that's  the whole *point*, can you see that?  Now stop being a little baby and get  on the damn bike. You gonna be afraid of things all  your life? Huh? That what you want? My wrist hurts...! Life is pain. Get used to it. See,  you *will* ride this bike home,  princess. You will ride it and you  will not fall again, *is that  understood*...? Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas  station... Right. Thank you Mr.  Henessey, I'll see you shortly. She said her wrist hurt. I didn't  know it was broken, God. I can't  even remember what I said to her...! A private detective's coming by,  he... he's found something. I may have to go away. For a bit.  Now please leave me alone. Are you deaf? I said leave me alone.  Go to church. Drink blood. Drink  some for me. Mommy...! GET OUUTTTTT!!!! NO!!!! It took me three seconds. That's...  that's good, huh...? Caitlin. We gotta find Caitlin. That man who tried to hurt us...? If  I stay here... other people will  come. I have to leave. Just for a  little while. I want you to light a candle and  keep it in the kitchen window. And  never, *ever* let it go out, because  as long as it burns...? It means  you're thinking of me. And if I'm  alone... if it's dark and I'm lost...  It's how I'll find my way home. That's for a portable phone. I keep  it with me, you call me anytime, you  don't worry about the bill. And last  but not least -- For luck. "Movin' in." It's not linen. The song's not about  linen. I'm freezing. I'll pass. So, you're a former cop. Atlanta,  was it...? Stop me if I'm out of  line, but I'm curious. How did you...  well, succeed? I mean, where six  other detectives failed? Yeah, this dirt used to be outside  my window, shut up and let me look. I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little  on edge. I can feel her. Like a ghost. We could walk away, you know. There's  still time, we could just... leave  her dead. Ay-i-yi! Size four, no way. You know how long  it's been since I could wear a size  four? Can't be mine. Can they...? What's in it? Hmm...? Uh, no. Just... more clothes. What's wrong with the dog? Hello, Mr. Windeman, I got this number  from a realtor in Pennsylvania. I'd  like to speak with you. You tell me, Mr. Windeman.

Oh God I took him,  such a good shot... I felt proud of  it, such a shot, Jesus, *how could I  be proud*...? I'm scared... I want to go home... Mr. President, please calm down.

That controversy has been  thoroughly dealt with, and if there  still exists a leak, perhaps this...  woman agent of his -- I don't want you around Todd, hear  me? Shrink told me what those men  did to you in prison. This is a  Christian household, my son's not  gonna develop any... tendencies.  Understand? I still can't believe it. You're  saying my hands didn't even shake...? What's the matter with you? What... what are you telling me? I'll spell it out for you, ready? I  have no future, *I can't go home*.  Until I know what's happening, I'm  in *prison*, you know how that  feels...? I'm sorry. Um... what did you...? The bonds. Your partner put them  there? No more killing.

What do we do  with this guy? It's possible. Caitlin. I don't know. It's coming back, though. All these...  little details about him. I know he's got a pin in his leg,  car accident. I know he cuts his own  hair... thinks Rush Limbaugh's an  ass. I know he sits down when he  pees. I know -- Mr. Windeman, please let him help  you. I know this man, I...
