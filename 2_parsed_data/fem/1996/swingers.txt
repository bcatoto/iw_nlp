Nikki. You better pay the man. I'd say about two weeks. Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager? I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks. What's that like? You're a comedian? ...maybe... I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you? I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you. What kind of car do you drive? What do you drive?Mike... Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of. You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with? Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that? Anything? To do what? What else? Like what? How? Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better. I thought I was going to die. You too? Well, I left someone very special behind. Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah. ...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here. Why? You're not a real man? I thought real men don't like quiche. Yes. Like the quiche. Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine. Hi.Don't worry. He's in good hands. What an asshole. They were auditioning for the same role as you? Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names... Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you. He is so sweet. He's so sweet. He really said that? The poor thing. I'll make some coffee. The poor thing. Six years? Did you get it? Lisa works at the MGM Grand... Always... What do you guys do? Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free. Wait here, I'll get you that martini. A couple of high rollers like you?I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy. ...And she's with someone else. Oh my God. I'm a "Dorothy". No matter what... like splitting aces. I understand. Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back. Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from? It's a rebound. Already? You poor thing. It won't last. I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years. What do you do, Trent? Well, who represents you back east? Who's your booking agent? Why not? You should. A lot of comics play Vegas. Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might... You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back. I can call back... Are you on the other line? Hi, Mike? ...well, it suits you... ...Which one...? Can I give you a ride to your car...? ...home. It's getting late. Yeah. Well, I should be getting... Hey, at least it's not Goofy. Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right? Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it. Can I have one of these? Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career? It's not going to well? I'll have to come see you sometime. You're a comedian? Let me get a pen out of my car. Do you have something to write on? I'll be around. Me too. Well... This is it. You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.Goodbye. I lov... I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes? I heard you might be moving back... No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens... ...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre... I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on... I miss you, Mike. It doesn't matter. I think about you every day. You know, us. Yeah. Good. I think about things. How are you doing? How's it going? It's been a while...Don't call me ever again. Mike? Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. Hi.
