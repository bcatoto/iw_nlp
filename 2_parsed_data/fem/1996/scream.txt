Don't make me... I can't... I won't. What? ...leave me alone... please... You tricked me... It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason. No it's not. It was Jason. ...please... no... Please go away! Leave us alone! NOOOO.... Michael... Michael Myers. I can't think. Please..stop... I don't know... No... Don't do this. I can't... ...please... No... please. Please don't do this... What kind of game? NOOO! No... Why are you doing this? Please don't hurt him. Where are you? How do you know his name? So you better leave. I'm telling you the truth. I lied before... I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you. I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone. My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him... Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else. What do you want? I'm two seconds from calling the police. Is this some kind of a joke? Listen, asshole... No-bored. Dial someone else, okay? What do you want? Yes? Gotta go. Nah, I don't think so... I have to go now. That's not what you said. What did you say? Why do you want to know my name? No. Why? You wanna ask me out? The first one was, but the rest sucked. Yeah... Freddy Krueger. Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours? I don't know. Uh-huh. Just some scary movie. I'm getting ready to watch a video. Uh-huh. Popcorn. I don't think so. Who is this? Hello. They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya. What? You're forgiven. Bye now. So why did you dial it again? Hello. It happens. Take it easy. I think you have the wrong number. What number are you trying to reach? Who are you trying to reach? Yes.I'll get my camera. Sidney's father? People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism. What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist... I like it. It's... sexy. So is Dewey your real name? Can I bring Kenny? I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright? What kind of lead? Mind if I join you? Then what are you doing here? You never know when or where a story will break. Deputy... good evening. You are precious. Please, call me Gale. Am I keeping you? I'm sorry. He's not a suspect, is he? Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father? Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there. Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer. Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out? I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer. And why is that? Has something happened? Productive. So they're closing down the school? Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY. As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote. What's the delay? Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities. Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty. If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof. No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete. Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming. Jesus! The camera-hurry! But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother? He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him... Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all. Many times. I think you falsely identified him. Yes. He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think. What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that. Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it. I owe you shit. Forget it. Kenny. Camera. Now. Just stay back. I'll send you a copy. It'll be out later this year. Yes, that's right.Ricki Lake. And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression. Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop. Maybe she's a slut just like her mom. Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage. What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve? For attention. The girl has some serious issues. She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.Where do you get this shit? Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered. You're evil. Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy. And why would she do that? Why would she lie about it?Not my daughter... not my... I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her. The phone's dead. Where is she? What is it? Where's Casey? I told you to send it back.Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy. Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS? Are you alone in the house? Stop it! I don't understand... Why did you kill my mother? Fuck you. NO! Don't believe him. I thought you were... No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you. Uh-huh. No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him. When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call? Who did you call? Yeah... I think so. You heard me. Or even a good porno. I wanna let go. I do... But this is life. This isn't a movie. Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense. I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something... But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was. No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress. So... It's okay. We need to talk. Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere. Tomorrow. One year tomorrow. No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom. No... You know that's not true. I'm so sorry... please understand. I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house. No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me. Jesus, SHIT! He's here. He's trying to kill me... Oh Billy... Please... God... Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship? You know what my dad will do to you? So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump. Oh it did? Now that it's out of your system. What are you doing here? My dad's in the other room. What are you doing here? Billy? What the... Should I be worried? Have they found my father? Yeah. Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling. God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. And my Dad? Any word on him? Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up. Any word on my Dad? I don't know. I guess. At the airport. Did you reach my Dad? ...yeah... I saw him leaving wearing it. He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat. Has his story changed? Have you talked to Cotton? During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar. Do you still think he's innocent? And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories. You owe my mother. Please. You owe me. Off the record. No cameras. I want to talk to you. I'm not here to fight. I'll look for it. How's the book? It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE? Who are you? LEAVEMEALONE! Hello? Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now. What am I doing? Can you see me right now? So where are you? Why would you call me from my front porch? So where are you? So who are you? That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy. Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous. Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit. I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy. Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over. I have no idea. Have a good trip. Got it. ...out at the airport... No you didn't. Can you knock? Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie. Don't come any closer. Stop. Right there. THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies? So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them? You'll never get away with this. You're crazy -- both of you. Why are you doing this? If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood. Yeah, okay... whatever. Are you serious? Why are they doing this? Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey? Deal. TATUM! What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing? No way. How does that get you in the mood with Stu? Who? What do you think about when you're having sex? But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic? Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax. Is Billy going to be there tonight? Oh, god... You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me. If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there. And you believe it? Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers. If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court? So you think my mom was a slut too? I don't know... It was him, Tatum. I know it. I bet he's pissed. This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here. But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now. Just a sec... I need to talk to someone. It's alright. I'll get it. He was there, Tatum. No, nothing's like it used to be. Just another sleepover at the Riley's. It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up. Whatever. Just hurry. I'm not worried. It's past seven. Thanks, Tatum. Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back. Tell your mom I said thanks. You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday. How do you gut someone? They think it's school-related? Do they know who did it? Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English. No way. What happened?What is she doing here? Shit. No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night. Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe. I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go. Hey... Dewey. Can we go now? Yes, you doofus. Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late. I thought Blockbuster fired you. Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night? Stu was with me last night. There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight. Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out. Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing. Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..." During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on. Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman. With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve. Billy and his penis don't deserve you. You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out. He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night. Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you? Come on, let's rock. Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us. Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it. It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men. You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor. I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman. Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom. Come on. Pathos has it's perks. This could be good. What do you think, Sid? It was just some sick fuck having a laugh. Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did. Shit, what is he doing here? I want you to meet me here right after class, okay? Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here. Come on, Sid. Take a message. I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw. Do you really think Billy did it? Just like old times, ain't it? Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us. Bye. Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis. Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten. Practice ran late. I'm on my way. Later. I'll be there by seven. I promise Yeah, yeah... are you okay? No prob. I'll pick you up after practice. Or a man's mentality. They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than... Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big. Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors... Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside. And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end. Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night. Do you believe this shit? What am I? The beer wench? Tits -- see. That's mature. For once, Stu, drop it. You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school. I thought you dumped her for me. That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT. Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
