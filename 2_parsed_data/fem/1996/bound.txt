I had this image of you, inside of  me, like a part of me. We make our own choices, we pay our  own prices. All part of the business. I want out. Like a part of me. Wait!  Hold the elevator. Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of  met in the elevator -- I heard you working in here and I  just wondered if you'd like a cup of  coffee? What happened to Rajeev? Rajeev, the man who usually works on  the building. So this is temporary for you? I guessed you were straight black. My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I  did have a slightly ulterior motive  here.  I was wondering if I could  ask a small favor? Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person,  so I was wondering if it wasn't a  terrible inconvenience if you could  wait a bit before using power tools. No, it isn't your fault.  The walls  here are just so thin. Yes, it really causes problems.   Sometimes it's like you're in the  same room.  But if it's too much  trouble, I understand ... You're doing everything yourself? That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of  people who can fix things.  My dad  was like that.  We never had anything  new.  Whenever something broke he  would open it up, tinker with it and  it would work.  His hands were magic. Yeah ...  I bet your car is twenty  years old. Truck.  Of course. I knew it. So, how do you know the owner, Mr.  Bianchinni? Oh, really. No, but Caesar does.  He likes him.   Says he's a good Italian. Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying  kind. I should be going.  You can drop the  cup off anytime. My pleasure. Like shit.  Now that we're all caught  up, how about a drink? You got a job yet? I mean a J-O-B.  A real job. Hello. Hey, Jesse.  What's happening here? Who's this? Wait, I know you. I didn't know you were out. Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would  call you.  God, you must think |I'm  a total nuisance. I'm sorry, I usually would call  Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do  so I called Mr. Bianchinni. Yeah, come on in. I was doing some dishes and just as  I pulled the stopper my earring fell  in. It's one of my favorites.  That's  why I got upset.  I know it probably  seems ridiculous to you. I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I  shouldn't have called... Sure. Did you find it? I can't believe it!  You did it! Thank you so much.  You have to let  me pay you something -- If you won't take money, how about a  drink?  It's getting late.  You can't  work all night. What do you want? A beer.  Of course. Sit down. Thanks again. You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make  you nervous, Corky? Thirsty, maybe. Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling  a bit curious myself right now. That's a great tattoo. Beautiful labrys. Are you surprised that I know what  it is? I have a tattoo, would you like to  see it? A woman in upstate New York did it  for me. Here.  Do you like it? It took her all day to do it.  She  promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it  was sore for a long time after.  I  couldn't even touch it. But now I love the way it feels. Here, touch it. Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to  seduce you. Because I want to.  I've wanted to  since I first saw you in the elevator. You don't believe me.  But I can  prove it to you. You can't believe me because of what  you see ... But you can believe what you feel. You see ...  I've been thinking about  you all day. If I say yes, will you take your  hand away? ...  yes. Please, Corky ...  please ... ...  kiss me. Yeah.  In here, C. I didn't expect -- Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar. She is working for Bianchinni. She's doing the work herself. Jesus, Caesar! That's none of your goddamn business,  Caesar. I had to see you. I wanted to apologize. I'm not apologizing for what I did -- I'm apologizing for what I didn't  do. Do you have a bed somewhere? ...  I needed that. You have to ask? Funny, nobody calls it that anymore.   Caesar calls it "The |Business." They took over a club I was working  at.  Caesar started managing it. Basically. Almost five years. Yes, it is. What? The redistribution of wealth? I'm already in your bed. You didn't have to tell me if you  didn't want to. I'm glad you did. I know he's gone.  Please.  I have  to talk to you. What do you want, Shelly? I had this image of you, inside of  me ... Like a part of me ... You are so beautiful. What's wrong? Yes there is.  I felt it this morning  when I brought you the coffee. You didn't want to see me, did you? What are you afraid of? I don't understand - ? We're not that different, Corky. Because it's the truth. Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's  a lot smarter than you. I know what I am.  I don't need to  have it tattooed on my shoulder. I don't. What you heard wasn't sex. All my life, everyone has been telling  me that when I have sex, I'm not  really having sex.  Not real sex.   But they're wrong.  I know what is  and isn't sex and what you heard was  definitely not sex. Work. You made certain choices in your  life that you paid for.  You said  you made them because you were good  at something and it was easy.  Do  you think you're the only one that's  good at something? We make our own choices and we pay  our own prices.  I think we're more  alike than you want to admit. You mean Shelly? No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw  me in a bar with another woman. Fuck it!  I think you better leave. Try not to steal anything on the way  out. Caesar, I'm leaving. Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too  much.  I have to get out of here. Caesar wants me to stay. Thanks, Mickey. Shelly was skimming from the business.   He came to see me yesterday because  he was afraid Caesar figured it out.   He wanted to run but he wanted me to  come with him. Yes. That's what he told himself.  But it  wasn't even about me, it was about  Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had.   That's how they are.  I understand  them. For Shelly, taking the money was a  way to take from Caesar.  He could  have run at any time, but he didn't  because he didn't want out. Maybe he did.  He would brag to me  all the time.  He was never afraid  of Caesar because he didn't know  him.  Not like I do. Caesar lives for these moments.  He  tells me it's just the business, but  I know it's more than that.  He likes  it.  The violence.  I'll catch him  in the bathroom mirror touching his  scars.  He says they remind him who  he his.  They're all like that.   Except maybe Mickey. He's the part of the business that  the rest of them pretend to be.   |But Mickey doesn't like it like  they do.  I suppose that's why he's  good at it. I used to be able to block it out.   I would tell myself that I wasn't  really there so nothing really  mattered.  But I can't do it anymore. I've been making the same mistake  Shelly made.  But now I know what |I  want. I want out.  I want a new life.  I  see what I've been waiting for, but  I need you, Corky. You made a choice once.  Do you think  you would make that same choice again? If those quarters fell to the floor,  would you still reach up to that  cash register? Caesar is going to get the money and  bring -- Shelly said it was over two million  dollars. Caesar will bring it to the apartment  to count and go through |Shelly's  books to figure out how he did it. That's why I need your help.  You  said you were good. You think I'm lying? Is that what you think? Do you think you know me like that? Oh my God ... Caesar, what happened? What are you going to do with it? Ummm ...  in the linen closet. You're having second thoughts. Yeah. He hung it up. To let it dry. It was unreal ... Hundreds, paper-clipped everywhere  like leaves. Then one by one, he ironed all of  it. No.  But neither did I. All night long I listened to that  sound. The sound of money. In his office.  I saw it this morning. I need to go to the store. It's in a case, on his desk. Yes. Johnnie? Like each other?  They hate each  other. It started way before I was around.   I think basically it's because he  thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot.   But Johnnie runs Chicago because  Gino is his father. Gino Marzzone. That's his brother. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, twice. Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous,  kept cleaning the apartment.  |The  first time, he picked out the dress  he wanted me to wear. Johnnie hits on anything in high  heels. He does it right in front of him. Gino doesn't know English, or at  least he pretends he doesn't, so he  doesn't talk much.  He gets right to  the point.  Both times they talked  for about five minutes, had one drink  and then they left. Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that  Caesar made a huge deal about it. The plane is in at seven, so I'd say  about eight. Gino travels with a big man named  Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver. Poor boy, has to work so hard. Where will you be? Waiting for what? Shit!  Oh shit! Caesar, it slipped ...  I was trying  to get ready ... I'm sorry.  It was an accident. Don't worry, I'll get some more. Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take  five minutes. I'll clean this up and be back before  you're even dressed. What if he sees you? You can't know for certain that he  won't see you. I'm just asking, what if? When I get the Scotch, how do I know  you won't take off? I still don't see how I'm going to  get clean with the money in the  apartment.  Everyone will think I  did it. Why? C!  Shit, I'm sorry! They were early. They just left, didn't they? You mean they weren't up here? That doesn't make any sense. Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs. I was getting out of the car when I  saw him in the Mercedes. It was him.  I'm positive. Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him.   I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't  believe I missed them.  I knew you  were going to be upset so I thought  I'd apologize and give Gino the  Scotch.  I honked a couple of times  but he didn't stop. Actually, I didn't see Gino in the  car. If he runs, everyone will assume he  took the money. Jesus, that's beautiful. If you're this goddamn smart, how  did you ever get caught? I won't. Caesar? Oh God ... Johnnie? Why?  Why would Johnnie do this? But you know he did it. Caesar, what are we going to do? C ... Caesar, maybe we should run -- I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie,  forget the money, let's just go now,  before it's too late -- All right, Caesar. It's me. He totally freaked.  I've never seen  him like this.  He's out of his  fucking mind. Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving  him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I  don't know, Corky, I don't know what  he is going to do.  I'm getting  nervous, really nervous. What if he doesn't run? Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here! okay, all right. He's coming ... The money?  The money's gone. But it could be anywhere. No. This is insane! I'm leaving!  This is crazy!  I don't  want to be involved.  I don't want  anything to do with this shit! The hell I can't! Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've  never needed me!  I can't help you!   Understand?!  I have to get out. Caesar, this is crazy. You don't, you can't believe that I'm not drinking. No, I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic. Caesar ... For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what  he says. What are you doing? Caesar, what are you going to do? What? Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone. What happened to them? Oh, no. Caesar, what are we going to do? Hello? The police? Gunfire?  Is this a joke? How do I know you are cops? All right. They're just cops. I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories. ...  thank you. Caesar, someone could see us out  here. C? C? It's not here, Caesar. I don't know.  it could be anywhere.   We don't even know if he was alone.   Please, Caesar, we don't have much  time.  Let's get out of here. What are you doing? Who are you going to call? Caesar? Oh, God. I'll start packing.  You know what  you have to do. Just hurry. Please, Corky ... Oh, thank God. I was so afraid you ... Corky, it worked!  He's going to  run.  He needs to take care of the  bodies to buy himself time, but as  soon as he leaves, it's over. just a little longer and it's ours. Corky, I have to tell you something Run!  Just run! Don't tell him -- He can't kill you -- Not until he has the money! Caesar, stop acting like an asshole  and think -- You need the money just like we do. Let us go and we'll make a deal. Everything you couldn't. Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at  yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug.   |You launder money for the mob.  You  rent women like you rented this  apartment. Saved me?  You don't even know me.   You used me, Caesar, just like I  used you.  All part of the business. You murdered Gino! Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me.   You did it because you couldn't stand  the thought of Johnnie fucking you. I'm sorry, Corky ... Hello, Caesar.  This is Gino. You're blowing your only chance.   Act like I'm Gino. Good boy. We were in a car accident -- But everybody is all right. Now you listen to me, asshole, I  know your gun is behind the bar ... We make a deal or I come out and  hand this phone to Mickey. I want what's mine, half the money.   We get rid of Mickey, no one else  dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand. Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the  Kennedy, in the waiting room, but  stay on the phone until I come out. Mickey?  What are you doing here? Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt? I should have let him kill you. I knew I couldn't trust you. Come on.  Come on, please. Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey! He made me help him, Mickey, God, I  was so afraid.  It was Caesar, all  Caesar.  You have to help me.  He's  coming - Oh God! Corky? Corky! Stop! It's over, Caesar.  I called Mickey.   He's on his way. Get out of here, Caesar.  If you  want to live you had better start  running. Caesar, don't. Caesar, you don't know shit. I will never understand it, Mickey.   You didn't even call the police. I know you will. Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get  out, you know?  Get away from all of  this. But thanks.  Thanks for everything. Hey. I'm here, aren't I? No.
