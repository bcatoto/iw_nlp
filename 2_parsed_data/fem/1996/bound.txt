I could be lying. You can't kill me yet. No. Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face. Lick me. Sure. My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though. I should be going. Five. No. Rajeev's in India. You planned this whole thing, didn't you? ... Me neither. You know what the difference is between us, Violet? How'd it go? Hey. Don't be sorry. Help me. You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you. I'm still here. We're almost there, Violet. just hang on. Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it. You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out. That means he probably will kill Johnnie. It's all right, Violet. It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does. That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie. What happened? I think we're going to find out. I had a partner and she fucked me. Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart. Thank you. You'll be clean and we'll be rich. He'll have to run. If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to. Because of what you are going to tell him. You have to make it as real as you can. The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan. Not Caesar. The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch. Trust. There is no going back. If he does ... Trust me, Violet. He won't. An accident. And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands. -- and shatter against the hardwood floor. Waiting in the apartment next door. We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again. Fine. Any bodyguards? What time did you say they would be there? What did Gino drink? It's getting better and better. Keep going. Has Caesar ever seen him? Does Johnnie hit on you? What happened? Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment. It's a big deal, isn't it? That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before? Sweet Jesus. And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone? Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money? ... shit. Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family? Who is Gino? Why? It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other. All right, now, tell me about Johnnie. Good. Does the case lock? And where is it now? What? Then what? Exactly. You said he washed the money? I think ... The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself. I'm just making a point. You have no idea what you're asking. How much trust two people need to do something like this. All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me. I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are. It would have been easy to set Shelly up. You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment. All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying. I am, but ... These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly. They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules. You fuck them, you've got to do it right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob. How much money? What choice? For what? Mickey? Sounds like he wanted to get caught. He was in love with you, right? Even though he knew about you? I think so, too. I suppose he just wants to watch. Don't tell me, you're a workaholic. What about that guy this morning? What was it then? What the fuck was it? For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember? What are you saying? That you don't have sex with men? Is that what her daddy tells her? Let me guess. This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside. That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me? How can you sit in that bed and say that? I know! You can't understand, because we're different, Violet. We're different. I'm not afraid of anything. If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading. Shit, here we go. Nothing. So am I. I guess I wanted to. My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught. She was always more honest than me. That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed. Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for? The redistribution of wealth. Five years is a long time. How long have you been with him? He's a launderer? How did you meet him? No. Caesar's Mafia, isn't he? Tell me about it. Don't apologize, please. I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex. Look, I don't think this is a good idea. No. You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you? Why? Maybe. Curious, maybe. No. A beer? Okay, one drink. No. Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it. I did it. Do you have a pot or a bucket? I told Bianchinni I would take a look. Is it that sink? He said you lost something. Not exactly. Thanks. Caesar is your husband? Do you know him? I don't, really. I was referred to him. '63 Chevy. Truck. Yeah. No, no trouble. There's other work to do. Are they really? Oh, I'm sorry -- A favor? Mmmm ... thanks, I needed this. Good guess. Pretty much. One day at a time. Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back. Who? Yeah, sure. I'm Corky.Caesar, you don't know shit. Caesar, don't. I knew I couldn't trust you. I should have let him kill you. Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out. I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies. No one. Say yes, I understand. We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey. Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ... But everybody is all right. We were in a car accident -- Good boy. You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino. Bullshit, you killed him. Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you. You murdered Gino! Saved me? You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you. All part of the business. Ha! What a load of crap. Look at yourself, Caesar. You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob. You rent women like you rented this apartment. Everything you couldn't. Let us go and we'll make a deal. You need the money just like we do. Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think -- Not until he has the money! He can't kill you -- Don't tell him -- Just hurry. Who are you going to call? What are you doing? I don't know. it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time. Let's get out of here. It's not here, Caesar. Caesar, someone could see us out here. Caesar, what are we going to do? What happened to them? Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone. What? Caesar, what are you going to do? For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says. Caesar ... You don't, you can't believe that ... Caesar, this is crazy. Bullshit! You don't need me! You've never needed me! I can't help you! Understand?! I have to get out. The hell I can't! This is insane! No. But it could be anywhere. The money? The money's gone. All right, Caesar. I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late -- Caesar, maybe we should run -- Caesar, what are we going to do? But you know he did it. Why? Why would Johnnie do this? Caesar, I know Johnnie. It was him. I screamed when I saw him. I couldn't believe I missed them. I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch. I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop. It was him. I'm positive. I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes. Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs. That doesn't make any sense. You mean they weren't up here? They just left, didn't they? They were early. Don't be silly, Caesar. It'll take five minutes. Don't worry, I'll get some more. I'm sorry. It was an accident. Ummm ... in the linen closet. What are you going to do with it? Caesar, what happened? Caesar, I'm serious. This is too much. I have to get out of here. Caesar, I'm leaving. That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar. Jesus, Caesar! She's doing the work herself. Caesar, this is Corky. Corky, Caesar. I didn't expect -- All part of the business. We make our own choices, we pay our own prices. ... thank you. I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories. All right. How do I know you are cops? Gunfire? Is this a joke? Hello? No. I'm here, aren't I? Hey. I'm sorry, Corky ... I was so afraid you ... Oh, thank God. okay, all right. Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here! What if he doesn't run? Believes it! Jesus, it's driving him crazy. He wants to kill him. I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do. I'm getting nervous, really nervous. He totally freaked. I've never seen him like this. He's out of his fucking mind. It's me. I won't. If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught? Jesus, that's beautiful. If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money. C! Shit, I'm sorry! Why? I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment. Everyone will think I did it. When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off? I'm just asking, what if? You can't know for certain that he won't see you. What if he sees you? Shit! Oh shit! Where will you be? Poor boy, has to work so hard. Gino travels with a big man named Roy. Caesar calls him the driver. The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight. Scotch, Glenlivet. I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it. Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much. He gets right to the point. Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left. He does it right in front of him. Johnnie hits on anything in high heels. Not much, really. Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment. |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear. Yeah, twice. Yeah. Yeah. That's his brother. Gino Marzzone. It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father. Like each other? They hate each other. Johnnie? Yes. It's in a case, on his desk. In his office. I saw it this morning. To let it dry. He hung it up. Yeah. Do you think you know me like that? Is that what you think? You think I'm lying? That's why I need your help. You said you were good. Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it. Shelly said it was over two million dollars. Caesar is going to get the money and bring -- If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register? You made a choice once. Do you think you would make that same choice again? I want out. I want a new life. I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky. He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do. I suppose that's why he's good at it. Caesar lives for these moments. He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that. He likes it. The violence. I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars. He says they remind him who he his. They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey. Maybe he did. He would brag to me all the time. He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him. Not like I do. For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar. He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out. That's what he told himself. But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar. He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are. I understand them. Yes. Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him. Fuck it! I think you better leave. No. Shelly knows what I am. He saw me in a bar with another woman. You mean Shelly? We make our own choices and we pay our own prices. I think we're more alike than you want to admit. Work. All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex. Not real sex. But they're wrong. I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex. What you heard wasn't sex. I don't. I know what I am. I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder. Oh no, she's nothing like you. She's a lot smarter than you. Because it's the truth. We're not that different, Corky. I don't understand - ? What are you afraid of? You didn't want to see me, did you? Yes there is. I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee. What's wrong? I'm glad you did. You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to. I'm already in your bed. The redistribution of wealth? What? Yes, it is. Almost five years. Basically. They took over a club I was working at. Caesar started managing it. Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business." You have to ask? ... I needed that. I wanted to apologize. I had to see you. ... yes. If I say yes, will you take your hand away? Because I want to. I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator. Isn't it obvious? I'm trying to seduce you. I have a tattoo, would you like to see it? Are you surprised that I know what it is? Curious? That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now. You seem uncomfortable. Do I make you nervous, Corky? A beer. Of course. What do you want? Thank you so much. You have to let me pay you something -- Sure. I'm sorry, look, forget it. I shouldn't have called... Yeah, come on in. I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni. Oh no. Shit. I didn't know he would call you. God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance. My pleasure. I should be going. You can drop the cup off anytime. Oh no, no. I'm not the marrying kind. No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian. Oh, really. So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni? I knew it. Truck. Of course. That is so amazing. I'm in awe of people who can fix things. My dad was like that. We never had anything new. Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work. His hands were magic. You're doing everything yourself? Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room. But if it's too much trouble, I understand ... No, it isn't your fault. The walls here are just so thin. Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools. My pleasure ... but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here. I was wondering if I could ask a small favor? I guessed you were straight black. So this is temporary for you? Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building. I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee? Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator -- Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know? Get away from all of this. I know you will. I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police. Mickey! Oh God, Mickey! Oh my God. Was anyone hurt? Mickey? What are you doing here? Oh, God. Caesar wants me to stay.
