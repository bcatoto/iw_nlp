It's real pretty, Alvin. It's real nice, Dad. Yeh. I was just sittin' here by the  fire doin' my homework, and decided  to give you a call. See how you're  doin'. Coach Winters has been telling me  about you. I'm looking forward to  seeing you when you come to visit.  I'll be your guide. You are coming  to visit aren't you? Now for the starting line-up for the  E.S.U. Timber Wolves. At tailback,  number 20, Darnell Jefferson!! I hope so, Darnell. Good night. Bobby, be careful, o.k? Please, be  careful. I came back early to see a friend. I can't tonight. I don't think it's a real good idea  for us to see each other, Darnell. No, it's not that... I've got a  boyfriend. Yes. I was mad at him. I caught him with another girl. A  white girl. Look, I got to get going, Darnell.  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lead you  on. I'm glad you came here. I'm in a hurry. Hi, Ray. This is... Fine. Only time I could get in here when  the football team wasn't usin' it. Don't need to firm up. I'm  strengthening my knee. Had  arthroscopic surgery. Sorry, I don't date football players.  They're all full of themselves. I  saw you on the cover of Sports  Illustrated, so you're probably worse  than most. No. You know, there's maybe one thing  I'd do with you. Tennis. I'll play tennis with you. Thanks for the game, Heisman. You  took it really well. I... I'm sorry... I just figured you  were probably kissin' yourself in  the mirror every morning. So what do you want, an apology? I  just gave you one. A rematch? I'll think about it. Hello... What? It's 3:00 in the morning. I don't know... I couldn't think of  any other sports I could beat you  at. What? Hi, Darnell. What are you doin here? I'm sorry, Darnell, but I've already  been assigned. You're gonna have to  find somebody else. I'm tutoring  Scott Sherman. Coach Winters wouldn't do that. Will you stop using those big words.  It sounds ridiculous. And you don't ever use them right.  Pretending to be smart is not the  same as being educated. Or erudite.  It's just a con. And it makes you  sound stupid, no matter how big a  prospect you are. We goin' on that? I promised my dad I'd never get on  one of those. All right. But we go slow. No cowboy  stuff. Yeh, fine. Slow down, damnit. Joe... Joe! Joe, look out!!! How could you do that, you stupid  punk? It isn't funny, god-dammit,  you coulda killed us! You're crazy,  you know that... Oh, yeh? Then why are you shaking? You just wanted to scare me. Are you  happy now? You come here a lot? It's not exactly a campus favorite.  This is almost like hidin' out. No, my dad owned a place like this. Not everybody with a Southern accent  has their own plantation. My dad  could never afford to send me here.  I learned to play tennis on public  courts. Mighta been able to play pro  someday, if I hadn't hurt my knee. Yeh. You disappointed? Is that what we're doin' here? Goin'  out? I think you're crazy for jeopardizing  your scholarship and a pro future by  jumping motorcycles off of highways. I don't know, Joe. You scare me. O.K., using the things we worked on  yesterday, I want you to write a two  or three page essay on some aspect  of your life. Something other than  football. Your father, maybe. You could write  about your dad. How about your mother? No... Jesus Christ, Darnell what a terrible  thing to do to somebody. That's not  funny. That's sick. No you didn't. You just... How could  you make up somethin' like that? Who took care of you? Well, then... maybe you could write  about football this once. Just one. Take it easy, Darnell. This isn't a  good time to push things. You're  putting me in an awkward position. That kiss... it was just... a kiss. I do take you seriously, Darnell,  but I'm still with Ray. I can't just  go paradin' around town. God, why am I even considering this? I don't hang out with him. I tutor  him. I can't do that. I made a commitment  to help him pass his qualifying exam.  I can't bail out on him now. I just said I wanted to help him.  What are you more afraid of, losing  your girl or your position? Maybe I will. You're right, nobody would ever see  us here. Thanks, that was fun, sort of. Well, it's not really my first time.  My dad took me skating once. Yeah, how'd you know that? Couldn't sleep. You drink too much. Why didn't you? Go home with her? Then why'd you pick her up in the  first place? Company? Yeh, I can see you havin' a  real far-ranging discussion with  Sheri. Why can't you pounce on me? Aren't I  good enough to pounce on? How do you know? You've never slept  with me. What makes you think she's such a  great ride? I'm prettier, my legs are longer... I've got better tits. Why would you go to her, when you  have me? Well you do. You shoulda looked for me at the  library, or don't you ever go there? I have a paper due Monday. What'de  she do? Sit on your lap or just give  you the nail-me stare? Bobby Collins. I... he was behind, he needed help.  I'm sorry. I just... I don't know... I thought he... loved  me... I'll get in someplace. They've always been good enough for  you. Good enough to devote your life  to. Why aren't they good enough for  me? Or are they too good? Didn't you ever break the rules just  a little? Didn't you tell me once  that 90 per cent of the schools obey  the NCAA rules, and the other 10 per  cent go to bowl games? Was that just  a joke? You seen this? You got a D on your  math test. We went over that last week, Darnell.  What is this time we spend in here?  Just a joke to you? I don't even  think you've been listening to me. Don't call me baby. I thought you  wanted to learn. But if all you wanta  do is fake your way through, then  get another tutor to waste time with. So far, it's the only test. I want  you to study this whole chapter. By  yourself, without me here. When I  come back, we'll discuss it. Be ready  to do problems based on it. Your parents comin' to the game  tomorrow? Why not? But you're one of the best players  in the country. O.k. What's goin' on, Joe? You ask me out  here, like you wanta talk about  somethin', then you don't say  anything. You worried about tomorrow? Why would it be your last game? You  afraid of getting hurt? Joe, why are you thinking like this?  Why would you be a failure? You're  having a great year, you're a Heisman  Trophy candidate, you got millions  of dollars waiting for you in the  pros. I don't know you? How can you say  that? Is that what you think? That I'm  with you for the money? Fuck you, Joe. I don't give a shit about your money.  I don't even give a shit about  football. And you know what? Maybe  you're right, maybe I don't know  you. Joe! Joe! My god, Joe, what are you  doing? No! No! God Joe, oh god, are you allright? I don't wanta get out, damnit. What's  wrong Joe? Why would it all go to  hell? You're not like them, you can beat  all that. You can stop drinking, you  can break the chain. You'de still be Joe. And I'd still  love you. Hi, Darnell. Yes... Ah, I tutor him... I think we better get back downstairs. No, I think... Not really... I don't know... he looks like that  E.S.U. quarterback guy. Joe, what's  his name? Darnell, wait. C'mon Darnell, I wanta  talk to you. Where you been, I been callin' you? Darnell, I'm sorry about Saturday.  It was an awkward situation. That's not it. It's just that my  father expects me to be with somebody  like Ray. He wouldn't understand us. I don't know... he likes Ray cause... I didn't say that. Darnell... Hello, my name is Camille Schaeffer.  I'd like to speak to Joe Kane. You've got a phone call. A Camille  Schaeffer. She says she's your girlfriend You sure? I'm sorry, he doesn't wish to speak  to you right now. Fine, Bud, ya know. Goin to J.C.,  hopin' to get back in here next year.  Just came by to give Bobby some  laundry I did for him. Yeh, he was even talking about us  gettin' a place off campus together,  until he got reinstated. I don't  know how I woulda told my dad. Why not? Ah. Guess I'm pretty stupid when it  comes to men. I never learn, do I? Thanks, Bud Give him these, will ya? Hello, Joe. You allright now? Good, I'm happy for you. You couldn't even talk to me. What  happened to "there's somethin' goin'  on between you and me"? Don't know. Haven't seen him since  the night I saw you. He'd been goin'  out. You knew? Why didn't you tell me? I just wondered how your studying  was comin'. You ready for tomorrow? Good... I talked to my dad last night. Fine. We talked about you. I told him I'd gone out with you...  I told him I wished I could still go  bowling. 15,10, touchdown! Daddy, you remember Darnell. You still feel like gettin' a beer? He's not a football player any more.  He's graduating this year. What are you doin' here? Shouldn't you be out celebrating?  You played real well. I'll think about it.
