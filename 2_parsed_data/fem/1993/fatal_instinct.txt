Got a light? How about a match? You really are incredibly stupid,  aren't you? I like that in a man. You sound so sure of yourself. Let me buy you a drink, Mr. uh... Thirsty. What about that drink? Brain surgeon? Oooo... and I bet you have a big  gun. If I can't buy you a drink... ...let me buy you one of those. Not me. Two dogs. Hot. Only when I'm in heat. Where ya going? That's okay. You're doing just fine. Oh yes, Frank! Adjust the stroke by  ten percent! That's it. Now tweak my points. Oh yes, oh yes! You got it! Stabilize your ball joints  and grind my rear differential! Now accelerate! Floor it! Lay rubber,  baby! VRRROOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM! Not bad for an auto mechanic... Better watch your tongue, sweetie,  or I'll have my husband arrest you. He doesn't. That's why I need you to  keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why  drive a jalopy when you can have a  hot rod? I would... if I could make any money  on the deal. Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm  still under warranty. Uh huh. Want some coffee? Frank here was just grabbing a little  before going back to work on my car. Ned... don't you have to be somewhere? Just the postman. He always rings  twice. Right here. The judge decided to  skip arraignment and take Milo direct  to trial. You're six minutes late,  but don't sweat it. You got Judge  Allen. He's always eleven minutes  late. I suggest you try Lemming versus  Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped  in the water and everybody followed. Really? Two years, seven months, twenty-three  days, nineteen hours... ...six minutes and fifty-two seconds. ...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty- five... fifty-six... Never. But that's okay. I don't need  a raise. In fact... I was thinking  of giving you a rebate on my salary. I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a  bit... claustrophobic... in the  bathroom. Wear the blue one. I waited. You never came back. Thanks... It's miraculous what a real woman  can do... with a bobbie pin. Cigarette? Yes, I know. I like things that are  bad for me. So... I hear you go both ways. No, I mean... you're a cop and a  lawyer. I'll get that. Lola Cain. So lovely to meet you, Laura. It's getting late. I'll give you a  ride home, Ned. I'll tow you. I should call someone to fix this... I'll call from home. I think I should warn you, Mr.  Ravine... I'm not wearing any  underwear. I've run across some... papers...  and I thought you might be able to  tell me what they are. You see, I'm  not very experienced when it comes  to... papers. No... they're at home. I thought you  might stop by... Don't they ever give you a night  off? Why don't we meet tomorrow evening  then? I'll let you know where. Nothing a good interior decorator  couldn't fix. Take care of this for me, will ya? Yeah, well you came to the right  place. Sit down. On duty all night. By the time he  wraps up his reports, it'll be close  to noon tomorrow. I was just reading over... Take off the hat, Frank. I was just reading over my husband's  insurance policies. You wouldn't  know anything about insurance, would  you, Frankie? I musta had my eye on something else. How about a translation. Meaning? Nine million dollars...? Why not? All three? It could happen. Suppose it did happen? Then we'd be rich. We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch!  And I know exactly how! He has a  legal symposium in Santa Barbara  this weekend... All we have to do is  get him to take the train up instead  of driving. That's where you come in, baby. You're  gonna rig his car so it doesn't work.  That should be no problem for you. Then... we give him a lift to the  train station... through Dealey Plaza,  past the Book Suppository and around  the grassy knoll... Move, Frank. And pay attention. Ten minutes out of the station he'll  be standing in the vestibule between  cars... trying to avoid a panic  attack. Fourteen minutes and ten  seconds out, the train crosses the  Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen  minutes and fifty-four seconds, I  shoot him, shove him out the door...  he hits the river and drowns. Bingo!  A triple play. We're rich! No. It just came to me. I had this image of a big, powerful,  throbbing train... plunging into a  long, dark, wet tunnel. My God, Ned... you look like you  were hit by a bus. Max Shady's mother. Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max,  is getting out of prison tomorrow. Seven long, miserable years in the  slammer. And he's a bit pissed off. I'm very concerned about him, Mr.  Ravine. He said you were a two-bit  shyster... and he's going to rip  your head off and use it for a bowling  ball! You think? Oh yes... live autopsies... Maybe so... but he said he's going  to punch you in the testicles... ...smash your face... ...and decimate your wardrobe. And I wouldn't want that to happen. He's a naughty naughty boy. I just  thought I should warn you. Bye for now. Oh... may I have a cookie? Sure. Thank yooooooooou. Oh my God, Ned. Don't you realize, Ned?... you could  be in real danger. Extreme peril. You know, the risk of  personal bodily harm. Your insurance file. But the policy's  missing. Did you take it home? Oh, wait a second... Yes... I know. It's okay. I'm just a  little... pre-menstrual. That Lola Cain... "person"... stopped  by. She left this! Thanks... Is it? I never know. My body heat  runs about twenty degrees above  normal. I doubt we'll find one. Even the  wind chimes on my porch aren't moving  much these days. They keep thudding  softly, like dairy cows bumping butts  in the night. I go out there expecting  to find a cool breeze... but it's  just a lot of hot air. A lot of them have tried that seat.  You're the first one's lasted this  long. Don't. It's broken. No. I thought you might come over... I brought my own car. I know it sounds silly, but would  you leave first... wait in your car?  I come here a lot and I wouldn't  want those men to think I'm "easy"...  a slut who'll jump into bed with  anyone at the drop of a hat. But if  you leave first... Now leave me alone! I have The Clapper. My wind chimes. Well well... I guess you have been  around. I'm impressed. Papers. Right. Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can  you tell me what they are? No. You keep them... as a memento of  our time together. I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay  you for all you've done? Isn't there some other way? No, I mean, isn't there something  else you want? Something I could  give you? How fast was I going, officer? Suppose you pull me over and frisk  me? Suppose I find a cop with a bigger  nightstick? Suppose you handcuff me to the bed? You're not so tough. Last chance. What's the matter? Don't you want  me? It's the way I look, isn't it? I knew you'd come back... That's not what you came back for. ...don't... stop... ...Oh Ned... please... don't...  stop... That takes care of foreplay. Iron Butterfly. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. It tells the sad story of a woman  who is rejected by her lover after a  brief, but torrid, affair... so she  stalks him with an ice pick and stabs  him with it more than a thousand  times. Yes... it was. I should check on my  homeowners insurance. What are you saying, Ned? That you're  rejecting me, your lover, after a  brief, but torrid, affair?! I want to see you, Ned. We have to be careful now. We can't  risk being seen together at the house  or someone might connect us to the  murder later on. Here... put this on. Speak Yiddish. Red Yiddish. Zein nisht azoy meshige! Der plan iz  kosher vi yosher. Vus iz mit idr? Die host a vaichen  schmoke? Lest'n Yomkippur. You speak Yiddish? Oh gee, you shouldn't have... She called. Wondered why you never  came home last night. I told her you  were working with a client,  undercover. Were you? There's lipstick on your collar. No... there isn't. But you answered  my question. She's a real looker,  huh? Lola Cain. Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't  noticed. That's alright. She noticed enough  for both of us. I worry about you, Ned. I worry a  lot. Max Shady's been faxing death threats  to you all morning. Did you get to the one...? Yeah... that one. Wait. It might be him. From my purse. Handing it to you. You shoot it. A bullet comes out.  Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a  cop, I'd think you'd know these  things. Is this another sick joke from Max  Shady? Lola Cain. I'll put these in water for you. Ned, darling... I know this seems  like a strange way to talk with you...  but since you won't take my calls, I  have no other choice. Watch it! That red car's turning  left! I love you, Ned. We're meant to be  together... forever. The light's changing! Floor it! Go!  Go! Go! Nice move! Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not  even your wife. I'd hate to have to  tell her about us, but if necessary...  I will. What happened to you last night? You could have called. But then, I  suppose you were tied up. I never know when you're coming home,  Ned. How can I ever make any plans? So what's in the box? What is it? Not enough like a cat. How about... Ned? No kidding. At least. Hello?... Hello?... Hello? Frank? Is that you? I told you not to call. Frank? FRANK! Who's Frank? I had to see you, Ned. I need to  feel your arms around me! I wanna  suck your toes til the nails pop  off! It doesn't matter. She'll know all  about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In  my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE! I got us tickets to see Iron  Butterfly! Why are you running from me? Didn't  it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing  my buns with carnuba wax? Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey  want to go exploring? It's not important. I just had one  last year. Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll  have another one sometime. You're so sweet. You don't have to.  You gave me a present last year.  Those lovely Ginzu knives. What's he thinking when he looks at  me with that goofy smile...? If I told him how I really feel,  he'd probably fire me. What am I  saying? He probably doesn't even  know I exist. I guess I'll just have to wait. But  he's married. I could wait forever.  Than again... maybe Lana will get  hit by a runaway truck. There's always  a chance that... That's alright. I was just rambling. No, no, really... you first... Oh, uh... I just wanted to remind  you about... ...in Santa Barbara... He's so cute. He can't even look me  in the eye. What is it, Ned? You can tell me. Really? Oh... wow... golly... Gosh... that might be okay. Like some ice for your drink? Does your wife know you're...  "working" late? I certainly hope so,  Mr. Ravine. Hurry up, darling. You'll be late! Wait until I signal you. When I raise  the blinds... you knock. Not now! Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye- bye to Little Ned. He loves his  daddy... don't you Stink Pot? What's wrong? Why don't you catch the train to  Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty  minutes. No! I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists  seized the airport this morning. A  plane crashed into the tower... and  all the runways are on fire! And it's fogged in. For my peace of mind... take the  train. Darling... it's only a short trip. Just because both your parents died  in a train wreck... And your brother, Morty... Right... Coincidence, Ned. Beside... that's  the past. They're gone. That's right. Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I  don't want to raise a child in a  home filled with fear! But if you can conquer your fear...  maybe I can conquer my fear of having  a baby with a father who's fearful. Ned... don't let a train kill our  child before it's even conceived! You're sure now...? Frank will drive you. Won't you Frank? Okay... now what're you going to do  if you feel queasy going through the  tunnel? That's right. When you get queasy...  go stand in the vestibule between  the cars. OH! My dear gracious! It's already getting to him. He'll  be out of that seat and into the  vestibule within ten minutes... I  guarantee it. You want to earn a couple bucks,  kid? He's losing it. You better get up to  the next car. Remember, give me the  high sign as soon as you see the  river. It'll be two minutes and nine  seconds past the tunnel. I'll take  care of the rest. Anything goes  wrong... just make sure you back me  up. And don't let him see you. What a nice young man. You are so  polite. Way to go, Ned. Right on time. Ned... you wouldn't... But... you said it yourself. I saved  your life. They're just doing their job. PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could  use a good exterminator. Can't you get me out of this cage,  Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here. What're you gonna do... arrest me  for primping? Well... I... Yep. Both of 'em. Yes. Yes! YES! Cappelini pomodoro! Pasta with tomato sauce. Whatsa matta?  You don't like Italian? I thought he might like to get out,  so I took him to the amusement park. You haven't seen the last of me,  Ned. I told you. Lana, Lana, she's the one Shot a bad  guy with a gun Blew that sucker off  a train Some guys are a friggin'  pain YaaaaaAAAAAAAAY LANA! Yes. It's a death threat that Max  Shady FAXED to you on the day he was  released from prison. U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi!  You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A- M-A! How you think you got that way?  Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama! Ned... did you ever consider that  maybe you don't know women as well  as you think you do? No you didn't! He was the best. And that's not just  a mother talking. You can ask anybody. Well, you know, pranks. Little jokes  and things. But he was so cute. I  have pictures! Here. This is when he set the cat on  fire... Oh... but the cat deserved it. Marshmallows. He just loved to toast  marshmallows over a roaring cat.  Burned on the outside... all soft in  the middle. And right here... this was taken on  the day he left the priesthood to  join the Green Berets. Oh yes! That was during his Ku Klux  Klan phase. He would take the sheets  right off my bed... cut those little  holes in them. What a stitch he was! Why that shouldn't even be in there!  It's his rotten little half-brother. Stinkin' little pecker... he never  was any good... Oh! I didn't like these neo-Nazi  boys. They were all so fussy and  persnickety about everything. Heil  this and heil that. Oh look... here's Max with his  chainsaw. He loved to go to the  national park and cut down those  giant old trees. It made him feel so  patriotic. You know, if he hadn't  been such a successful criminal... I  think he would have been a lumberjack. But now he'll never be anything! Not  since... ...that woman, your wife, pulled the  trigger and put my little Max in his  grave! Don't you tell me what to do with my  finger! It's been more places than  you've ever dreamed of! I'll point my finger wherever I want! Do I have to answer that, Harlan? No. Call me Angel Tits. I saw Max Shady at the station...  saw him get on board. I knew he'd  made threats to kill you and mutilate  your reproductive organs... ...so I got on the train too... so I  could warn you. Someday. With the right man. It would be difficult. Something like that. And fired and fired and fired and  fired and fired and fired and fired... ...and fired and fired and fired. Well, counselor, looks like you won  another case. Lucky for me. I told you, Bernard... smoking cigars  is bad for your hearing! How much for my gun? I don't believe it! She just bought  her gun back! The gun she used to  kill a man! No thanks to you. You didn't lift a finger, Frank. You  let me take all the heat. You were gonna let me rot in the  slammer... never say a thing. I'm not splitting anything, Frank. And you know too much. You're right. Maybe I'll just screw you to death. Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um... Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith.  I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine.  The big powerful kind that suck up  everything in sight. I was just  telling your wife, if she wants to  get rid of all her dirt, she has to  be willing to pay the price. Let me know what you decide, Mrs.  Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a  convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure  meeting you... Ned. I... hate... SALESMEN! A trip? I like that. Just you and me... all  alone. I'll start packing. Who is it? Why didn't you say so? Would you like a drink? Then let's get to the point! So what's your problem, tough guy? A VACATION! She doesn't deserve a  VACATION! She's a brat! A bad girl!  She always was and always will be! I know EVERYTHING! She's your wife! She's my sister! She's your wife! She's my sister! She's your wife... AND my sister! She was spoiled rotten! She stole  everything I ever had. Everything!  Including him. Dwayne. The boy's gym teacher. He  was older. So mature... so strong.  He smelled like dirty sweat socks  and old basketballs. And he was all  mine. For awhile. But Lana wasn't satisfied with her  own things. She had to have mine  too. She took it all... my makeup,  my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear... We were identical twins. Not anymore. One day I caught her  stealing my lavender eye shadow and  she smashed my face in with a shovel.  I had fifty-three operations. When  the doctors were finished with me...  I looked like THIS! I'm ugly. UGLY! Don't lie to me. I look in the mirror. I can SEE! Tell that to Dwayne. When he saw my  face, he left me for HER... because  she looked more like me than I did!  First she stole my looks... then she  stole the only man who ever loved  me! But I found a way to get even. The  best revenge possible. Destroy her  marriage! You been hangin' out with Dick Tracy,  haven't ya? It doesn't matter. I'm blackmailing  her for everything she's worth. She  murdered that greasy auto mechanic.  I saw her do it. Kelbo! His name was Kelbo? Dwayne's name was Kelbo. He had a  son. Frankie Kelbo. Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so  much to tell you. Thanks... I brought my own. A lottery ticket and a laundry  receipt. I found them in the pocket of that  suit you wore the night you were  working under cover with a client. You remember that night, don't ya  Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts  with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L- O... L-A. Lola. Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's  mind works. Fine. Then I remembered you told me  some guy named Frank had been working  on your wife's car for two months.  You with me so far? Well back it up. You probably took a  wrong turn. Remember your insurance  policy... the one we couldn't find?  I started thinking, who else had  access to it beside you and me? The  answer came up... Lana. And since  she's a woman, it's probably hidden  right here. Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your  life when she shot Max Shady. She  and Frank were plotting to kill you  and collect on your insurance policy.  But she shot the wrong guy. Don't you see... Frank was going to  let her take the fall. So she murdered  him and tried to make it look like  suicide. That's when I realized there was a  connection between Lola and Lana... Well, hang on to your jock strap,  Ned. There's more. Not only is Frank's father Dwayne  Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher  and Lola Cain's former lover...  Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max  and Frank are half-brothers who never  met. Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered  both of Helen Shady's sons. And you haven't even heard my story. He turned into a monster. And that's  when I left him. I just couldn't... Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine. What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me  away? I never forget anything... honey. Those are MY panties! Oh Ned! Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved  you! Got 'em! I said... I GOT 'EM! Okay. But I want to have kids. Ned... Knock off the chatter, will ya? We won't need you anymore. We can make our own music. Ned, do you know... I want you to  make love to me all night long?
