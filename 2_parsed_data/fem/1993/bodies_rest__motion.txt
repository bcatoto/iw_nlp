What? When? In two days?! Thanks for the news... You got me. What does Beth say? Three years. I know... Good-bye. How long a drive is it? That's not bad. Get saved. Hey. Think about this. You take a  detour and go through Vegas -- you  and Beth stop, see a show, have a  nice romantic dinner -- play the  slots, get the free drinks... No, you skip the hotel. It's night,  the highway's empty -- you can make  good time. You start speeding. You  get stopped in Utah by the cops --  you flunk the breathalizer, they  haul you in. The judge is Mormon --  you get fifteen years, you go to  prison, but at least your life has  taken a direction! I'm here! Hi! Hi. Hi. G'night. G'night. Okay. I've got the short shift -- you want  me to come over, help pack? Great... I'm really sorry we didn't  tell you sooner. He just decided. I understand. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. I haven't got a problem. I know. Billings, Montana. City of the future. Just some friends. I know. I'm not eight years old. I know I'll  make new friends. I, umm... I... It embarrasses me.  When you talk about something with  Carol that happened before me. She's  my best friend. It embarrasses me  that you used to live with her. Three years. I know... It does that. No. Lately. Water comes out. It still works. Okay. Do you want a donut? You got me. And it's fifteen inch. We don't watch much. Why don't you take one? Not a donut. A t.v. It's your last day. Yeah. I say do it. Sears can afford to give you a bonus. What do you mean? Nick. They fired you. There's no bonus. You should take a t.v. Mmmmm... Who are you? What are you doing? You... Why are you here? We're still here. Can't you come back tomorrow? Yeah...? Billings, Montana. It can't be worse than Enfield,  Arizona. No. I haven't. You can skip it. I won't tell. What color is it gonna be? It's already off-white. What would you choose? Sorry I'm late, the new girl's a  moron. Going away present. I thought you might need it. Let's highlight your route. Here's Enfield. Visit them. You're going to be driving by. You might as well visit. Let me. I'm starved. What? Oh. They? Nick. Nick. The man I live with. He'd find us. And he'd be surprised. No... But the rest of the time they were...  awful. Nick. We couldn't stand each other.  We stopped in Enfield and just stayed. Big trees scare me. I don't think we're going to take  much of the furniture. It's ugly. It's a sofa bed. It weighs two thousand pounds. It's yours. Nick's gonna steal a t.v.! Who are you? He's really gonna do it? He says yes. We've got to talk. There's no crime. That's just an expression. It's making the rounds. College  students use it. Sears. You want him to know? He knows. He doesn't care. Do you care? It's not a crime. It's justice. Poetic justice. They fired him. Who is this guy?! The painter. No. He needs you at the store. He needs me? This is what you do? Which is your career? That is true. I work on it. Yeah. Yeah? Oh... great! Thanks... I get the t.v...? I get the t.v. Excuse me, I just... You can't help me? Nick sold a demo, wrote it up like a  new set, and gave me the receipt. Maybe I should just leave it packed... Ha ha ha. You're stoned! You're being silly and you've got  bunny eyes. No? You got Carol stoned? I didn't think she liked you. She does. This is the nicest thing I've ever  owned. It's a beautiful picture. Yeah! Fuckin' Nick... Hi, kids. Come see! I should have had him steal me one,  too. You can come over and watch. Oh. Right. Sorry. Forget it... How's the painting going? You have bad work habits. It makes teevee seem very futuristic. I'm hardly stoned. It was homegrown. Want some Visine? No. Thank you. Shit. Missed the eye, got the face. Need help? Yeah. Okay. Tilt your head back. Beth... Stop fidgeting. Got it. Next eye. Wait a second. He really wants to get in your pants. My pants are taken. Why don't you go for him? He likes you. I wish Nick would get back and help  with the packing. He's probably getting drunk with the  stockboys... That's what he's probably doing. Beth... Listen... He's gone. Yeah. Where'd he call from? He said the highway. I have to do something. I'll help. I've got to be out of here Sunday.  That's tomorrow. You can come to my place. He's gone. He's an asshole. Fuckin' Nick... He said he needs to be alone again.  Learn about himself. Make a fresh  start in a new town. He's sorry. He said he would have called you,  but your phone's disconnected. 'Cause  you're moving. He's always been an asshole. You'll be all right. Yeah... I'm here. I know that. Oh... uh, no... We're fine. You've lived here your whole life? You've never gone anywhere? None? That's not offered. Why? I'm serious. Maybe that's my problem. Thanks. You think your father knows the truth? Has his luck found him? Must be the paint fumes... You find what you want here? Yeah? Oh. No... No... Leave what behind? That was a bad answer. It's not. I'll find happiness. Right. In your  arms. In you. But I won't. I have to find happiness  in myself. You're showing how young you are. I don't know you. I know you want to fuck me. I know... I know you. I know you. Hello. This is his house now. He's deaf. He's stone deaf. No. No. Elizabeth. Yes. Thank you. No. He wouldn't remember. Yes. He doesn't remember anymore. No. Did you lose them both at the same  time? No. I lost mine one at a time. Last year. Six months apart. Body failures.  Separate body failures. First my father's heart kept starting  and stopping. My mother and I were with him in the  hospital and he'd grab at us, he'd  grab my arms and hold on. Right before my mother died, she  said -- "Elizabeth. You're adopted." No. Two are enough to lose. I'm not alone. I have my Grandfather. I'm sorry. He's stone deaf. I have to be out tomorrow. The moment's gone. Have you ever been in a relationship? You weren't married... Do I remind you of her? Thank God. Freckled... What happened? Was she ever found? You've stayed here and you know who  you are? And you know what you want. Oh. Good. Come here and put it inside me. Doing this is as close as you get. Come here. Come inside me. Yes? I want... I want... Come inside me. Hi. I didn't want to wake you. I'm not. I've got to pack. No. You paint. I'll manage. Oh God... I'd be so much happier if I could  blame this on Nick, but it always  happens to me. I'm always left with  nothing. It doesn't matter if I leave the guy  or if the guy leaves me -- I'm left  with nothing. I never do anything  for myself. I never acquire anything.  I mean Nick didn't take from me. He  stole a t.v. and left it for me. He  didn't take my things, he didn't  take our things... he didn't even  take his clothes! And I'll still  leave this house with nothing! No... He didn't take 'em. I mean, when he  cared about me, he cared about me.  And he was really good in bed. I didn't expect more. I can't face this. I'm gonna finish up the kitchen... ...get some momentum... How was he? He's twenty-four. A little weak on tenderness, but  long on juice? Long on conversation. Did you need talk? Yeah. I guess I did. Good. So what are we doing? Christ... I gotta get out here. I was in Tucson  two years before you and Nick got  here. I've been here five years... Yeah... This state's driving me crazy. So what are you gonna do? I've got no money. I've got some. I can't take it. I mean you're being  great, but I can't take it. I'm gonna  be gone, we won't see each other,  and I won't send the money. I won't.  I know... I won't get around, I'll  forget, I won't do it. Shit. I'll sell all this shit. I  don't want any of it, just my car  and my clothes... Okay... I'm sorry... I shouldn't have fucked  this kid last night. I should have  slept. Now I've got all this stuff  to do, and I'm tired, I'm churned  up, I'm in a fuckin' mood. Let's do things, get you busy. Yeah. You get all the stuff you wanna sell,  and I'll make some tag sale signs. No one'll buy my stuff. It's all  junk. That's what people buy at tag sales.  Broken appliances, ugly knicknacks. I guess I do have stuff to sell. Is there something specific you're  looking for? Yes. Actually everything... I don't have  anything. Nothing? I just moved to town. My husband passed away, and I, umm,  didn't want to have our things...  they were too familiar. You can have it all for three hundred.  The stuff in these boxes and  everything inside. Oh, my, I don't know... everything? Everything. Except the t.v. The t.v.s not for sale. Maybe some nice turquoise jewelry. Maybe a nice Navajo rug? That's authentic -- it's very  expensive. I'm sorry, what's your name? Can you just leave the name blank? I  won't have an account, so I'll have  to find someplace to cash it for me. All right. Thanks a lot. You did all the work... Of course. I'll follow you in my  car. Thank you. You've given me a home. I'll be right along. This had to be history's most  efficient tag sale. Yeah... I'm sorry Sid stuck you with  unloading. No problem. He kinda bites my butt, but he's  okay. He is. Listen. I'll probably be gone before you get  back. I thought maybe we could be roomies  for a while. You know, while you  figure out what's next. I can't. He gets to me... too much. If I don't  go I'll end up with staying with  him. You've done worse. Sure. Sid? I'm sorry about selling the sofa  bed. But I gave it to you. No. It was all even in this department. I know... You're hard again. Shit. I just fleeced a widow. It was all junk. Shit. I've got to get some aspirin... I didn't drink enough to be hung  over. Yeah? It's never happened to me. I... I've got to go now. The new people'll be here. No. No. I gotta get out. No... Agawam?... no. I don't know  where I'm going. Somewhere else. Sid. I'm going away. You're making  me way too important. You met me  yesterday. Jesus... one day... No! That's... that's a fuckin' animal  thing, I've done that. I meet men, go home with them and  just stay. No decision involved --  it's just what I do. And then I don't  have to live my life, I just lead  theirs. I can't keep doing that. What way are we? It's been passionate, it's been  comfortable. But it hasn't been...  important. Like you're making it! No! It was a night! It wasn't real.  It was fun, it was some great fucking!  But it's just something that happened!  It's not real! The "one"?! I've had lots of "ones"!  I look like a baby but I'm twenty- fuckin'-- eight years old! You're  just the latest! No! Oh, Sid... Forever? You have to understand -- it's just  talk. It is. C'mon, these things you say...  c'mon! What?! If I died you couldn't  stand life? That's... that's... No. You won't know when I die. You won't  be there. No. No! I care about you. No. I care about you. But I'm an adult.  I can say no. Yes. I can say no. No, I won't do that. No, I won't  have that. No, I can't. Yes. I'm going. I don't. Don't tell me what to do. I don't know. You came back. Is Beth here? No. You're too late. Beth's new boyfriend. You heard me. You left her. You didn't find anyone. Let it drop, Nick! He was nice to Beth when you treated  her like shit. Nick. This is me. You didn't come  back for Beth's sake -- something  just didn't work out like you had  planned. He was sweet to her. They were sweet  with each other. Beth looked young with him. They had  a real connection. Leave him alone! And what is that? There isn't anything he can do. He wouldn't know where to look. What? How do you know she's on the highway? You've got a chance. So. Start painting. Hello...? We're here to move in. Are you the couple moving out? No. It is... and it's so nice of you to  greet us. Thank you. Yes. It is. Well, dear... we should carry it  home. Do you need help? Thanks anyway. Nice meeting you. They'll finish. I wonder where our furniture is? You're not going to be their new  neighbor. Good. You look terrible. You were drunk... Beth?... I'm sure. Nick?... What you've been doing... you can't  do anymore. You just can't do it. Okay? No. I don't think so. It's not like you can't do it. It's that I don't want you to do it. Nick. I don't want you to do it. Shit. I hate talking to you.
