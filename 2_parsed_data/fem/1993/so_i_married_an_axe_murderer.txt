I'm leaving you. That's not funny, Charlie. I'm really  leaving. We've had a fight every night for  two months. Ever since I brought up  the subject of marriage, you've found  fault with everything I do. Why  couldn't we have gotten married,  Charlie? It's been two years now. I need  something more. That's like saying we're not the  sort of people who are going to grow  old. We're not going to fall into  that "growing old" trap. Face it,  you've got a problem with commitment,  Charlie. Take a look at your other  girlfriends. Every time you get close  to a commitment there's something  wrong with them. What about Sandy? No-no-no. You thought she was an  alcoholic. She just drank more than  you drank. What about Jill? You thought she hated your family.  Nobody hates your family. Everybody  loves your family. What about Julie? What does that mean? Well, Charlie, I wonder what you're  gonna say were my problems? Are you  gonna tell your friends that I was a  junkie, that I wasn't supportive  enough or that I smelled like relish?  Charlie, I loved you. It could have  worked out. Think about it. Sure! My name's Susan and this is June. We  think you're funny. Poor, guy... He seemed so nice. Goddamn shoplifter. But I got him! You're next. No stay! Oh, this! Oh, no, this is what he  stole. This isn't a piece of him or  anything. This is Icelandic Shank. Can I help you? Yes, we do. It's over here in our  Scottish Cuts section. One? That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine.  Will there be anything else? Now where in the world would I get  Prussian Venison? Charlie, put on Charlie Pride, would  ya? Oh, I love Charlie Pride. Stuart, you're going to give the boy  a complex. Is that enough potatoes, Charlie? I'll put it in the frig. Would anyone like a juice? Charlie,  did I tell you, we bought a Juice  Tiger? Aye, it's a juicer. It's part of my  National Enquirer, Garth Brooks diet.  Would you like potato juice? Sherri's late. Oh, you didn't. Sherri was the  daughter your father was never able  to give me. Maybe it's just as well not to get  married, look at the news. Where did  I put it? Oh, here it is. Mrs. X. The Honeymoon  Murderer. She marries men under fake  identities, and then murders them.  She killed some German martial arts  expert, and some plumber named Ralph  Elliot. Her whereabouts are unknown. Ah, you're steaming. Oh, you've turned into a sexy Italian  bastard. Oh, hi haggis, right? I remember you told me you were  Scottish, but do you really like  haggis. Can I help you? Sorry, I'm really busy. Well, actually, Yes. Can you get me four Belgian  porterhouses? Do you know what a  porterhouse looks like? Look, I'm really grateful. Can I  offer you some meat as payment?  Please, help yourself to some meat. Trying to be a vegetarian? I think the meat industry invented  hot-dogs to stop people from becoming  vegetarians. There's got to be  something I can do to repay you. I hate talking about old  relationships. That was easy -- What a nice guy.  You've probably never done a mean  thing in your life. I'd like to hear. Name me something bad you've done in  your life. No. Did you ever steal anything? You  ever hit someone? Not one bad thing, Charlie? How evil? "Brutal" is such a subjective word.  I mean, what's brutal to one person  might be totally reasonable to  another. Actually, he just proposed to her.  Those are tears of joy. Prost. Do bright women intimidate you? Really, what do you look for in women  you date? Income of course, and then... ...savings. I'll make us some tea. I used to live there. That's where I  had my first supermarket job. I only have chamomile. I hope that's  all right. It's North-South. For health reasons. See... I had  this friend, he was a martial arts  expert. Anyways, he used to sleep  North-South. I don't know... It's a  martial arts thing and it just sort  of became a habit with me. Late? Who for then? Well, you looked at your watch and  said it wasn't late for you... I  wondered who it was late for. I want to spend the night together. Yes! Yes! Yes Ralph. I will. Ralph. Now now Ralph! Ralph? That's odd. Just today I was thinking  about, her. She's a friend. Yeah. She's great. Go away. I'm Harriet's sister, Rose. And this  is Harriet's note. 'Dear Charlie, I didn't want to wake  you, make yourself at home, thanks  for making me smile.' Harriet. I'll make you some breakfast. What would you say to blueberry  pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape  juice and Kona coffee? I'm sorry I didn't have any of those  other things. Got 'em. Yes. She's been here the past three  months... ever since she came back  from Miami. I used to visit her  occasionally. She didn't speak of  me? She spoke of them...? Well, you know Harriet. But you did have sex with her? Yet you still don't know her. See, that's the problem with sex.  It's not very revealing. You should be careful, Charlie. I'm gonna go now. I won't tell Harriet  that anything happened. Exactly. Or she would be jealous.  And when she gets jealous, we both  know what she's capable of. You'll be okay, Charlie. Just be  careful. I don't think so, Charlie... Uh... Did you have a nice date last night? Rose, I don't really -- He disturbed me while I was naked in  the shower this morning. Yeah, he stayed over? I didn't mind. Charlie and I laughed  about it over breakfast. That's good. He said you had great sex last night. He did? Yeah. He seems really stuck on you. I hope  for you that it lasts. Rose he's a sweet, kind and loving  person. We like each other, but I  don't want to think any further.  It's taken me a long time to get  back to dating, and I want to take  things real steady this time. Well, you can trust me not to tell  him anything. He was quite happy not to talk about  the past. I did a sketch of him. That's good. Think I've caught him? The eyes are good. Charlie really liked it. It's a good likeness. Boy, I really hope it works out. Rose, I don't wanna screw this one  up. Charlie, they're beautiful. I'll put  them right in water. I was just getting dressed. What do you think of this skirt? So then you think I could go to a  poetry concert like this? Come on we're meeting your best  friend. I wanna look good. The second  I go to the ladies room he's gonna  tell you what he really thinks of  me. Come on, Charlie. We have to be there  in fifteen minutes. I thought of calling you. To warn you, Charlie. There are just some things you should  know, about Harriet. About her past. Here's the thing. I may have to tell  Harriet. That we're lovers. I know, and it's a damn shame. I hope I'm not interrupting. So I heard. So, don't you think we look alike? Oh, we do not. Harriet was always  prettier than me. And a heck of a  lot more popular. She always had  boyfriends. The only thing I ever  got was good grades. She's just being kind. Show Charlie  one of your photographs, Rose. Rose  is a great artist. No, Harriet. I don't want to. They're  not good. You're so modest. If I weren't here  to brag for you, I just don't know... Show it to him, Rose. Do it. Thanks. I dunno. I dunno. It is titled. It's called "I dunno". We should get going, Charlie. Thanks,  Rose... See you later. Bye, Charlie. Oh, I know all about him. Oh, he did...? You're funny... No, Charlie. I'm the worst. Sorry... I told you Charlie. Yeah, let's go in. I feel so safe with you right now.  You're never going to leave me, are  you? I feel like I could be here  forever. Ralph! No, Ralph! It'll be fine. Ah, Charlie is this the wee Harriet.  Ah, she's beautiful. Thank you. She's so sweet. I hope you keep her. Stuart, come out here. You tube. Stuart, put your pants on. I'm sorry. I just... You just  surprised me. I'm sorry. I'm really embarrassed. Oh, ignore him. Come have a look at  some photos of Charlie when he was a  wee'n. Ah, Charlie, lighten up. You've got  a pickle up your ass. Fine. Don't worry about it. Hurry. Make sure you leave the seat down. He always leaves the seat up. He's  gotta learn. This is Charlie with his Uncle Ecky.  He's a policeman in Canada. And our  cousins Ruth and Jack. He's just got  a restraining order from his wife.  She's a lovely girl. This is Billy.  He's a member of parliament. He  drinks. What a nice family you have. Charlie was the cutest baby. I can't believe the resemblance  between you and Charlie, Mrs.  MacKenzie. You have the same smile. It's so  incredible. No. Not officially. I dated a guy  for a while who ran a studio. Actually, Miami. Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic  City was recent. I didn't care for  Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers  and lounge singers. There's no record of any deaths. All  three of these guys were reported  missing around the time of their  honeymoon, but so were the wives. No  pictures of any of the brides. For  all we know they just picked up and  moved away. Mr. MacKenzie, we've found that,  most National Enquirer articles are  actually based on our own police  reports. They take the facts and  fabricate a story around them. You're back. But Harriet's not here  yet. Sure. That would be fine. I'm glad you asked. I didn't want to  be so forward. I mean, if you're  waiting inside, then you feel  obligated to entertain me and keep  up the conversation just to be polite,  and really your head might be totally  elsewhere and then there's the chance  that you would really want to talk  and it's me who'd be busy, but in an  attempt not to be rude, I sit there  and listen to some story that you  don't really want to tell and I don't  really have time to hear. You know? I think about a lot of things. Okay! What would you like me to do? Harriet's far more talented than I  am. Well, I don't think she'd wanna do  this sort of... I doubt I'd have any. Harriet hates  being photographed. Rose -- did I see Charlie's car out  in front? We're in here, Harriet. What are you guys doing? ...Charlie wanted a photo of you. Why of me, Charlie? There, can you remember that? Downstairs. I have a surprise for  you. I got something much healthier for  you than that. It's a health shake. Eggs, malt,  cinnamon, oranges. It's great. I  mixed it up downstairs. You'll like it Charlie. You won't try it. I spent twenty  minutes making it. I'm gonna take a quick shower. What do you care? I drank it. You could have at least tried it.  You make me feel bad sometimes,  Charlie. I don't know why. Sorry. I'm a little sensitive. You  didn't want to drink my milkshake.  So what -- right? Charlie, what's the matter? Charlie... I know, Charlie. And it's not just  that. Look at the things people are  doing. Partners killing each other...  I mean, you hear a story like that,  and... who can you really trust these  days? It's like, have you ever stood with  someone at the edge of a cliff, or  the edge of a subway platform, and  you think, just for a split second,  "What if I pushed him?" I'm just making a point of how many  times we trust people with our lives.  I mean, look at us. If you didn't  trust me, you would never be able to  fall asleep. Look at you, you're sleeping. Look  how vulnerable you are. I mean, I  could do anything at that point. Anything. You're lying on your side,  asleep, I could... stick a needle in  your ear. I'm just making a point of what a  good relationship we have. Goodnight,  sweetheart. Well, good night. Good night. Thank you very much, young man. I've  gotta get all this stuff back to my  children. When I say my children I mean my  cats. You see my children moved out  years ago, so all I've got is my  cats. I have over one hundred of  them. Charlie. You see this red toy? That's for the  Captain, he's finicky. and this blue  one? That's for Marco Polo. Oh, yes. Let me see! There's Winston Churchill,  Reda Sovine, Thomas Edison, Andrew  Carnegie... Wasn't he Irish? Now that you say it, he was Scotch. I'm sorry, I didn't know it meant so  much to you. Hi. Why not? And tell me the truth. I don't think so. I'm going to "cleave you?" What does  that mean? Rejecting me. I know that... So why are you leaving  me? You haven't. At least you left early  on. So, that's it, then. I've got a lot  of work to do. Now, where were we? Hey, Charlie. I'm okay. This is Michael. Michael,  this is Charlie MacKenzie. I'm teaching him. I heard you have a  new girlfriend. Problems? Let me guess... She's a murderer. What else is left? Go away, Charlie. You really hurt me. Sure, talk. Hi, Charlie. Trust your first instincts, Charlie.  You never do. It's your big mistake.  That and the haircut. You didn't lose me. You rejected me. How do I know you won't reject me  again? I love you. But you blew it, Charlie,  you blew it. I don't mean to be a pain, but I'm a  stewardess, and I have an early flight  out in the morning. Can you please  keep your music down? I thought it was coming from here. But someone keeps shouting your name  over and over. I've been there for almost a year. I  only planned on stay with her for a  few weeks, but she gets upset every  time I say I'm moving. I pretty much raised her. You know  the scene. Depressed mother...  withdrawn father. My dad was a photographer too. He hated it. Trudging off to those  weddings every Saturday night. Other  people's celebrations he called it.  He said sometimes they didn't even  offer him a glass of soda. He had a  small studio, and every year at  Christmas he'd take a picture of me  and Rose and put it in the window on  a little card that said "Seasons  Greetings." Awful pictures. It's  like... I could see his pain in my  face. Anyway, me and my sister worked  with our "childhood issues" in  different ways. She became a  photographer and I became phobic  about having my picture taken. It's  quite a family. Dead. Car accident. Harriet, its for you. Charlie, I want you to meet a friend  of mine. Say hi to Ralph. This is Charlie. I'll leave you guys alone. Have a  great time. Why, yes, you are. Okay, everyone come and get a piece  of cake and some milk. Boy, you really made some impression  with Ralph. She can't get over you. Is everything all right, Charlie?  You're perspiring. What? No. I don't know, Charlie. It's so good  like it is. Why don't we just live  together first? Yes. Let's get married, Charlie. Harriet, come here a minute. I want  you and Uncle Angus to play a song  together. I do. Charlie, get this down your neck. What are you...! Sorry. The flash just... They're great. I can't wait, Charlie. It sounds wonderful Honestly? It sounds a little Hallmark. You want anything? They were. I think they're gone. The gas station guy. I thought he  was chasing us for a while, but I  guess he stopped. I don't know, Charlie. I guess for  not paying. I forgot to pay... I didn't want to  be away from you for any longer. Yes. And you're an accomplice. Look, Charlie, don't you get it?  We're a team. Oh, hi! I was just doing a murder series in  honor of the wedding. Yes, Harriet, give it to me. She's a  butcher. ...She owns a butcher shop. Sorry. No can do. It didn't come out. The picture didn't come out. It was unflattering. In made her  look ten pounds heavier. She's my sister. And if she's not innocent. If she's,  you know, "quirky?" It's like a castle, Charlie. It's so  beautiful. Just a little head-ache. Excuse me, is there a drug store in  the hotel? I want to get some aspirin. Thanks. Don't go anywhere. I'll be  right back. It's nothing. It's just... I was  just thinking... We're married now.  And I always wanted to try and have  kids, and... It's just, I get scared that certain  things will happen, or... It's not that, Charlie. You're gonna laugh. If we have kids, Charlie, things  happen. Kids are healthy and fine,  and some aren't, and I don't know if  I could live with myself if I gave  birth to a child with webbed feet. You're laughing. You think that's silly? It really worries me, Charlie. You're the greatest Charlie. I just wanna look good for you,  Charlie. That's all. Do I look okay, Charlie? What's wrong? Oh, yeah. Charlie, your food is getting cold. What's a matter, Charlie? What happened, Charlie? Hello, Charlie. Smile, Charlie. Act like you're having  a good time. I'm sorry, Sir. The roads are all  closed. We can't rent any cars this  evening. Don't go, Charlie. I heard you on the phone before,  Charlie. There's something I've got  to tell you. I've been married before. About my husbands? AAAhhhhhhh! Charlie. Why did you marry Harriet?  I warned you not to marry her, didn't  I? I warned all of them. But none of  them listened to me. They all went  ahead and married her. She's the  pretty one. Where's Harriet? What  have you done with my sister, Harriet? If you've done something to my sister,  Harriet, I swear to God I'll kill  you. Where are you, Charlie? What's going  on? Charlie, did you like your note? I  thought it was pretty accurate. I  did all the husbands' notes. I can  forge anyone's handwriting, I can  write in anyone's style. See, I'm an  artist. Harriet isn't an artist.  Sure she could get a husband, but  she could never have done this. And  you know what I'm most proud of? Harriet never knew. She thought they  all just left her. I protected her.  She's my sister. Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet.  I'm in here. Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie.  They're out on the ledge. Sure, anything. You've got to save  Charlie. Look! It's Charlie! I swear to you... It was Charlie...  Look! Now there's Rose! I beg you... Look! It is Rose. I thought you were going to leave  me, like the others. Thank God they  were just murdered. I thought they  were always leaving me.
