What?  I know, honey, I promised. I know.  Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see the puck.  Yay, hooray.  Yeah.  know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve victims, dismembered them and ate them.  Yeah, I'll say.  That's right.  I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes.  Oh, you do ?  Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall.  Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline.  It's important to put that time in. It does wonders.  Oh god, yeah. I agree with you.  Exercising changed my life.  Well, geez...  Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it because it was just taking up too much space.  Oh, it-it-it...  Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never gonna get that.  Oh, I know. It's late.  It's so wonderful, meeting.  Oh, well, yeah.  ... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know... and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo.  Oh, uh, say, hello ? CAROL (voice over) Huh ? Yeah ?  Huh, listen... why don't you come in for a-a-a second and have a drink with us ? I mean, we'd really love that.  Oh, oh well that'd be fine... PAUL (voice over) She makes great Irish coffee. LILLIAN (voice over) Oh, please ? Uh uh, I want you to give me a treadmill lesson.  Oh, about the tread... oh, well, if I can figure it out, then believe me, anybody can.  Have a look at the instructions. They drive me crazy. You know ? I don't know what I'm doing at all. Let's look... CAROL (voice over) No. Please, it's easy.  Wonderful book they've given me. Now I'm at level five. CAROL (voice over) What ?  That I know. CAROL (voice over) You're that advanced ?  Well, yeah. CAROL (voice over) God, I only got to level two.  Look at these diagrams. Do you believe this ?  That's amazing.  I can't understand this even.  Let me see.  Yeah, well. See this ?  Okay.  Coffee's ready !  Well, we've never had any children, but it's easy to empathize. Oh, um, uh, what college does your son attend ?  Brown.  Oh.  Paul never attended college. He's self-made.  And, do you work ?  Huh ? Do I ?  Yes.  Oh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency, but that was many years ago.  But... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me out of it.  He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic food.  My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything with fat.  Oh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to exercise for a month to work it off.  Yeah. PAUL (voice over) We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary.  No, really ? LILLIAN (voice over) Yes. Twenty-eight years. November. CAROL (voice over) Really ?  We already have twin cemetery plots.  Yeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them.  I was just trying to be neighborly.  You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ? LARRY (voice over) What ?  Well, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you know... LARRY (voice over) We are a dull aging couple.  Our TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery plots ?  How often do you think they make love ? LARRY (voice over) Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape. You know, I'm sure as much as once a week.  Larry ? LARRY (voice over) I'm exhausted. What ?  Do you still find me attractive ? LARRY (voice over) Of course. What kind of question is that ? Of course I do. CAROL (voice over from behind the partition) Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old shoes, are we ? Do you think ? LARRY (voice over) Never comfortable.  No ?  Uh...hum. You know... Ted's coming to Elaine's with us.  Ted.  Yeah.  How is Ted ?  He's... he seems to be doing well. I mean, I... I actually think he's glad... I think he's glad he's divorced.  Well he looks... I think he looks, you know, like he's glad.  Yeah, we're gonna go see «Double indemnity».  Oh, really ?  Yeah.  It starts in a little while.  God, that movie was great, wasn't it ?  I loved it.  You know, who could we fix Ted up with ? I mean, there must be somebody in your office.  Yeah.  Me ?  Please. I mean, you know, I adore him, but you know, he's like a girlfriend to me.  Do I detect a note of jealousy ?  Is there anything we can do ?  God, okay.  Oh, hallo.  Hi, Mr. House, so... sorry.  Oh.  That's... sure.  No, anything. Anything at all. I mean, God, it's just such a shock when anyone... It was just so sudden. I mean, she seemed so... God, well, healthy.  She did ? She never mentioned it... It... that she was...  No. Right. Well...  Yeah, anything. Really.  Oh, no, no, no. I know, I haven't forgotten. Believe me, I haven't forgotten.  Yeah. Oh, I know. We're going to the opera.  Goodnight.  Oh, I know, I know. And she did not look like she was ready to go.  She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition.  Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy in the first five minutes.  No. No ! She wasn't on a diet. We discussed diets.  Well, it's thanks to you, actually. I mean, it was his idea. The cooking lessons, so I mean...  I'm not being cavalier about it.  But it's bi... it's what I do. It's-It's what I do, Larry.  You do it anyway. Right as well get paid for it.  Oh.  Did he seem a little too cheerful ?  The restaurant ?  No, no, no. No, no, no. I mean, Mr. House, Mr. House. Didn't seem a little too cheerful to you ? LARRY (voice over) Mr. House, our next-door widower ?  Yes. Yes. I mean, there's... Well, you know. I mean, didn't he seem too compose for a man whose wife just died. Don't you think ? LARRY (voice over) Well, Jesus. What do you want the guy to do, walk down the street sobbing hysterically ?  Well, I don't know. All I know is, they were supposedly looking forward to their, you know... anniversary, and, and, and, you know, uh-uh, i-i-if... I suddenly dropped dead... wouldn't you sob for months, or-or years, if I... You know... LARRY (voice over) Hey, don't make those kind of jokes, okay ? I don't like those remarks. And, meanwhile, I'm the guy who needs a physical check-up.  Oh, I don't know. LARRY (voice over) Uh, uh.  I mean, to me he just seemed a little too perky. You know ? Now, suddenly he wants his French desserts, and, «Have a nice time, you know, at the opera». And, my God, «We're certainly dressed up». I mean, you know. This guy should be a wreck.  Helen Dubin's wrong for Ted.  She's too mousey.  Who is it ?  Ted, hi.  No, no. You know, I mean, I just think this guy is too perky. You know, I mean he's not acting like a man whose beloved of twenty-eight years died just a few days ago.  Yeah, I know.  What? Oh. Here. Just a sec. Here's Larr...  Well, it's dark.  Oh, I see.  Oh, look at this though. It's really so beautiful.  But... it's kind out of the way for a restaurant, isn't it ?  It's beautiful, I bet.  Hi. How are you ?  These are my floating islands. I hope you like meringue.  Well, okay.  I know, it's just...  I did do it. I told you. Anyway, this has got... this is vanilla sauce here and I put little chocolate truffles.  Do you like chocolate truffles ?  Oh, well...  No, no, no. Look, I'll make the coffee. That'd be better. Let me make it.  No, no. I insist, I insist. Go on, sit down, relax.  Enjoy yourself, you've been through enough.  Thank you.  Well, thanks very much. Uh, was it a large... funeral ?  Right. Just a simple affair, uh ? Well, they're the best, aren't they ?  I guess. Anyway, then you're laid the rest, and, you know, I was just... where, um, where are the twin cemetery plots ? We... because, we were thinking that that was just such a romantic idea. Weren't we, Larry ? You know ? Larry ? You remember when we were talking about the twin cemetery plots and, you know, how kind of romantic that is ? Remember ?  Listen, Larry.  Listen.  Okay, just... I was in the kitchen okay ? And I was making the coffee. There were no beans, so, I was looking in his cupboards, just to see, you know, and I came across this urn, okay ? And I opened it and there were ashes in it.  Larry, he had her cremated !  Oh, and who else would it be, okay ?  Look, Larry. All I know is he lied, okay ? He lied. LARRY (voice over) Look. Maybe-maybe-maybe he is embarrassed. Maybe he didn't want to spend eternity next to the beloved, so he-he told us that-uh... You know, what's the difference ? Who are you calling ?  Ted !  Oh, I know. I know. What about this ? What if they had a big insurance policy, or something like that, huh ?  Hu-Huh. (speaking on the phone) Hi. Yeah. Hi, it's me. Listen, we were just in our neighbor's apartment, right ?  Yeah. And get this. I came across an urn with ashes in it. Only he says he had his wife buried.  Mm. Right. They'd have detected poison, wouldn't they ?  Yeah, but why would he... Why would he be lying ? I mean, why-why would he lie at all ?  Yeah. Oh, would you do that ? Because... That'd be great. Because, you know, I'm not good at that kind of thing, okay ? All right. Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.  Hey, I'm not tired.  You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home, tomorrow.  You know what I mean ? I mean, I don't understand why you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be living next door to a murderer, Larry.  Oh my God !  Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. I-I-I heard a noise in the hallway, so I just... I... You know, I-I looked and I think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator.  Yeah, you know, I was... I'm-I'm... almost certain that it was him.  Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be ?  I know. I know. But wh-who would it be at one-thirty in the morning ?  But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm saying ? A joke ?  I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home. LARRY (voice over) You're gonna ring Mr. House, now ?  Yes, because this is really... LARRY (voice over) What are you talking about ?  It's very sus...  Let me just... Larry, don't. Wait.  That's one ring.  Okay, two rings. He's not there, yet.  What are you doing ?  All right, I'll call. Just keep ringing.  Keep ringing.  Oh, man.  I don't know. What is he doing ? Where is this guy at one- thirty in the morning ? You know what I'm saying ? LARRY (voice over) It's not your business. He can go any place he wants. CAROL (in the phone) Hallo ? Yes, hallo. This is Mrs. Lipton. Yes. Did anybody just leave the building ? I'm just... hmm. You're sure ? You're sure no one ? No, okay. All right. Yes. Thank you.  I don't believe this. Man, I don't get it.  No.  Just let me think about this a second. Okay, I got it. Wait. I know, it... No, wait. Listen to me. Larry... Listen. He got on the elevator, okay ?  No, wait. No, no, listen to this. No.  I know. Larry, he got on the elevator and he took it to the basement.  He has a car, right ? He's got the garage door key, he opened... he could... he has the...  What do you mean, «so what» ? He's...  All right. So, I'm right, though.  I mean, I'm right.  Yes, he isn't in his apartment.  Yeah, that's right.  What about your rigidity ? How about that ?  How about that point ?  Hi !  Jack ?  Jack, do you think you could come upstairs today, because I got a leak in the kitchen ?  You can ?  Well, but, it will be this afternoon.  All right, you're not gonna go now ?  In a minute.  Ted... I'm in his apartment.  The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his satchel.  He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.  I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here, okay ? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, I-I'm just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just the craziest thing I've ever done.  Well, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean...  You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it.  Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film critic. LARRY (voice over) Right, but not-not a blackjack dealer, right ?  No, but I put myself through school playing poker.  Well, I wouldn't say beautiful. LARRY (voice over) Oh, I would.  But I do have tremendous sex-appeal.  Story of my life !  Oh, stop being such a fuddy-dud.  Yeah.  It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in.  Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay ? Okay ?  He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.  He talked on the phone with a woman.  Because he... Well, he came back while I was there, you know, so...  Yeah, but I hid under the bed.  He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all.  He was-He was very lovey-dovey with his kind of bimbo, you know ? He kept saying stuff like, you know, «don't worry, it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together.» That kind of thing.  I know, listen, I-I couldn't think that far ahead.  No, I c...  Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. He-He called this woman back. Probably this-this Helen Moss woman, right ?  And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he leaves this message, and he says : «Tell her Tom called». You know what I'm saying ? Tom. Tom, Larry.  Well, okay. Well, I'll tell you. I thought I did...  I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think a private eye could have done any better than me. I put everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I made one mistake.  I left my reading glasses on his table.  Oh, hallo. Hi. I-I thought I'd bring you some chocolate mousse. I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert.  I thought I'd-I'd give you, you know, another shot at something really delicious. Do you want me to serve that for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's still fresh.  That'd be great. That's a great idea.  Okay, that'd be really good.  Come over here. I put'em... um... right here. Right in here somewhere. The first... Wait. I should... (to Paul, with a much louder voice) Uh, how-How are you doing in there ? You need...  You need any help ?  Tea. It's what... I'd like to have some tea.  Mine ?  Yes.  Uh, no. Yeah. Uh... No no no no no. They... They... Oh, God.  They are actually... They're mine. Honey, they're mine. I... You know what happened ? I think the other night, I must have left them here. It's the strangest thing.  No, no. Yeah. I know. Because, remember, you were saying that you thought that I left them at your mother's house ?  That's right. Of course, so...  Anyway, it's so good. I love mousse.  Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in the Caribbean ?  Uh uh.  That's because I must have dropped them and they probably got kicked under.  They were just...  They f...  Anyway, I'd love to have some mousse.  I remember.  I know, but where... where are we going ? TED (voice over from inside the car) I looked up, looked up Helen Moss in the phone book. CAROL (voice over from inside the car) Yeah. TED (voice over from inside the car) It was just H. Moss. CAROL (voice over from inside the car) Right. TED (voice over from inside the car) So I-it's on Bank Street... TED (voice over from inside the car) Bank Street... we're going to go down and do surveillance. I got a lot whole of food. It's great. I called up this... I called this number.  Right. So we should just sit here and wait, huh ?  Okay.  Oh, I don't know. Yeah, maybe we're wrong, Ted. Maybe we're just, you know... I mean, maybe she died of natural causes, like the doctor said and we're just two people with, you know, hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little shot of adrenaline.  Yeah? What's that, there ?  Okay.  It's not her ?  Oh, God, you really have this worked out, don't you ?  Maybe she doesn't work. Maybe she's like... you and she has writers hours.  Oh, God. Oh, dear. What ?  Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.  Right. Do you remember those wonderful cottages ?  And I remember... that we shared a bedroom together, right ?  No. Well, I knew what was going on in your mind... because of the way you kept plying me with Chateau Margaux, remember ?  Well, you... Yeah, God. It seems like a long time ago, doesn't it ?  Oh, what ? TED (yelling in voice over) Helen ! (with a softer voice) Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck ! CAROL (voice over) Oh, god, yeah. Right. TED (voice over) She didn't see us. She didn't see us. CAROL (voice over) No ? No. That's gotta be her. TED (voice over) I'll bet it's... CAROL (voice over) Are you sure ? TED (voice over) I mean, she answered to Helen. CAROL (voice over) She answers to... She's pretty. TED (voice over) Yeah, I'll say. CAROL (voice over) She's... What is she doing ? She's getting a... TED (voice over) She's getting a cab. CAROL (voice over) Okay, okay. Hold on. TED (voice over) Keep-Keep down. CAROL (voice over) Okay, don't worry. Don't worry. TED (voice over) I'm gonna follow her. CAROL (voice over) All right.  Oh, this is beautiful.  Yeah. PAUL (voice over) Well, we only show revivals now. This week, we have Fred Astaire. Next week, we have an Orson Welles festival. HELEN (voice over) Oh, yeah ? PAUL (voice over) Yeah, it'll be about the last thing we do before we start renovating. HELEN (voice over) Mm. Oh, Paul, I... PAUL (voice over) Oh, come on, there's nobody around. HELEN (voice over)  Oh.  All these mirrors.  It has such a lonely feeling.  It sure will.  Where ? PAUL (voice over) Oh, Mrs. Dalton. I didn't know you were here so early.  Oh, uh, I-I didn't know whether an-anyone was here. I-I'm sorry. I-I-I heard the noise and I thought... PAUL (voice over) It's quite all right.  But, but, uh... PAUL (voice over) It's quite all right.  I apologize. PAUL (voice over) Quite all right.  All right. HELEN (voice over) I'd love to really get an acting job. I had it with this modeling. PAUL (voice over) Maybe you won't have to work at all.  Okay. Uh, it looks like he's gone. Yeah. Yeah. He's gone.  Listen, Larry. I want to take another look around his apartment. Yeah.  Listen.  He'll never be back, Larry.  No, he's not coming back. Not for at least an hour, an hour and a half.  Yeah.  No, wait a minute, look, he was with this young model type, and they were talking about money.  So, that's the motive.  What are you talking about ?  Come here. What do you mean, Larry ?  What do you mean ?  What do you m...  Huh ? Larry, I went for two years.  Just come... come on.  Larry, we'll be in and out in five minutes.  Five. Only five.  Well, I didn't...  No, I...  Larry, all I can tell you is, if this had been a few years ago, you would have been doing the same thing. Because if you recall, we solved a mystery. Yep, we solved a mystery once. Remember ? It was the-it was the noises in the attic mystery.  That's right. So...  This... Wh... You agree, right ? It's murder, Larry ? So, I'm right.  Oh, damn it.  Please, stop it, will you ? Please, be quiet, Larry.  Be quiet. You're gonna wake up the neighbors, okay ? Okay, I got it. I got it.  Listen, Larry... Relax, okay ?  Oh, don't worry about it. All right, now Ted told me to try something here... Yeah.  Um, «Last number dialed».  Just be quiet for a second, all right ?  Shhh !  Larry.  Uh, who ?  Um, who's this ?  Do you know anybody named Waldron ? Waldron ?  Just be quiet. Okay, wait.  Oh, great. Now they-they hung up on us.  Oh, great.  No, just let me think for a second, now. Waldron, right ? Helen Moss. Okay. He used the name Tom, right ? So, Tom Waldron. We gotta run a check on that.  Come on.  Right.  Oh, oh, wait. Look.  What do you mean ?  What are you do... Well, just... Clean it up, Larry. Clean it up.  Put it under the rug, or something like that, okay ?  Well then glue it. Glue it back to...  Oh, look. Look.  Look.  So ? I know. I know, but you keep yours out on the bureau in this kind of weather ? Uh ?  I think something's very strange, here. I mean, he left these out and ready. I think the whole thing is really sinister.  What ?  So, how did you like your birthday cake, Nick ?  I know.  I know.  I know. What-What-What are you laughing about ?  Well, what about that ?  Oh.  Really.  You're going to get something from Brooks Brothers ?  Well, if I'm going to be a restaurant owner, I should know something about wines. Don't you... Larry ?  What ?  Hi, Larry.  Good. How are you doing ?  Honey, I'm here. I'm right o...  Carol. Remember me ?  Oh, hi.  Hi.  Good to see you.  That's great. Oh, your friend called me. He's taking me to dinner in New Jersey next week. Some mafia joint.  Oh, you did.  Well, very nice. That's lovely.  Great. Great.  Well, good to see you. Good to see you.  Okay, you too.  Take care.  Goodbye.  So, that's Marcia Fox, huh ?  Well, do you think she's Ted's type ? Is that...  Yeah.  Thank you.  You know, your pupils are dilating.  I just wanted to tell you that.  I see.  What do you mean ? Nick.  So, Larry fixed you up with Marcia Fox, huh ? His, uh...  His favorite writer.  Oh.  Sure.  So, you're taking her to Vincent's out in Jersey ?  Is that what you're...  No ? God, look at this! Oh, that park is so beautiful.  No ?  You're getting... So am I. I don't know about this.  You've got to go, huh ?  Okay.  Me, huh ?  Well. Oh, boy.  Thanks. No, I-I think I'll stick around, I need to think. I need my... I feel a little, you know, tipsy.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You didn't offend me, no, I was very, uh, flattered by this, Ted. Flattered. Well, anyway.  See you. Oops, careful. Whoops.  Excuse me.  Larry. LARRY (voice over) What ?  I just saw Mrs. House. LARRY (voice over) What are you talking about ? The ashes ?  No, no, no. A bus. It passed me, and she was on it.  No, but I'm not, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm telling you something. I'm telling you, I really saw her. I actually saw her.  Yeah.  No, Larry, you know, I was at the wine-tasting, right ? And I was just... I was sitting at, you know, a bay window. I-I happened to look out. A bus passed, and she was on it, Larry.  I...  But ?  Yeah...  I know. I know. Okay. I-I... Yeah. I had a few drinks, but it's-it's not... I mean, I saw her.  I ...  Okay. Are you telling me that you... That, that, that, that you... That I didn't see her ? Is that what you're saying ?  I just... I just don't know what's happening, Larry. I-I-I don't know what's going on.  What's... yeah.  I...  Why ?  Honey, you're getting so close-minded these days. I just...  Oh. Oh, God.  Hallo ? Ted. Ted.  Ted, you're not going to believe this, but, Ted, I saw Mrs. House. Yes, Mrs. House. Yeah. Mrs... the murdered woman. That's right.  Yeah. No, I'm sure. I'm sure I saw her. She was on a bus, you know ? I mean, I-I saw her just moments after you left. I was looking out the...  Would you ?  Would you really ? Oh, that would be so great. You'd just run a check on Paul and Lillian House.  What are you talking...  What are you doing ? I mean...  Larry, what are you... But, what ?  I'm telling you, I saw Mrs. House.  I s...Okay.  Now look. Just... I can tell you. I can show you the exact spot, Larry.  Uh ? What about lunch ? Tomorrow ?  On... on your, on your lunch hour ?  Oh, God. I'm telling you... I mean, this is such a shock.  I mean, I'm telling you, I'm just vibrating from this. I mean, I saw this woman.  What ? Wh...I'm not going to the theatre. LARRY (voice over) What do you mean you're not go... We've been holding onto these tickets for two months, now.  Do you comprehend the enormity of what I'm telling you, Larry ? Do you compr... LARRY (voice over) If you got a big story, tell it to the Police. Don't tell it to me.  What am I going to say to them ?  What story ? I don't have a story. I mean, I got nothing. Unless... Oh !  Unless... Unless I locate her.  Right. Yeah. You saw her lying there, right ?  You said... Yeah, but... but you're, you-re sure it was her, right ?  Okay, look. Yeah, yeah.  The super is a drunk. I know, but, we've seen him smelling of Jack Daniel's, remember ?  I mean, I know he didn't see Mrs. House, Larry.  Well, I don't know. Oh, I know. Unless he's in on it.  Shh !... Shh !...  I mean, she...  Well, she's alive. And my question is, who was in that bag. I mean, somebody...  Look, somebody... Somebody got cremated, Larry. Somebody.  Right.  Right, I know.  So goes Larry's theory.  Right here. This is it.  And I was having a glass of, you kn-you know, wine, and I looked out the window, and-and I saw the... right here.  Yes, I saw... her on a bus. It was passing. You... It was, like.  I'm positive I-I saw her.  Whoo !... Excuse me. I-I'm telling you, Ted.  Uh, I don't know what the number of the bus was, but I know that it was heading west to east, so it was... it obviously was a cross-town bus.  Right.  So, okay. So, then, it's like...  Then... Her destination was probably within the next five or six blocks.  Don't, don't doubt me, okay ?  I'm-I'm not kidding. Look.  Oh, God. Well, I think, you know, I think we've reached the end of the line.  Look. The bus.  Yeah, what ? Oh. Whoo !...  Yeah, I know.  Well, what do you think ?  Do you think we should retrace our steps ?  No, I don't think it looks good, and I don't even know if it looks... I mean, I feel like it'd be to masculine if I wore it with a pair of pants.  Oh.  Ted, look.  Well ?  Wh-What about...  Great. Oh, God. It looks like it's gonna rain again. Well ?  If I get two kings, I take one. Otherwise, I fold.  Got it ?  That's how you wind up on welfare. LARRY (voice over) You know, I need the action, for some reason. I-I can't... I bet anything. Okay, just... MARCIA (voice over) Cut ? LARRY (voice over) No, no, go ahead, I trust you. Lay it on me.  You seem in a strange mood.  On Perrier ?  Want any cards ?  Four ?  Cruising for a bruising.  You're in trouble, now.  Really.  You must love her a lot.  Um... if you want to hold on to her, you have to make some effort. I mean, who's the guy ?  Ted.  Well, we could always switch. Ted gets Carol, I can be your date.  So, you bored ? I mean...  Yeah. Well, to me, I mean, just... I mean, it's just one of the most exciting adventures I've ever been on.  Well-Well, he has a more enthused attitude, Larry. I...  Yeah, enthused, yeah.  Well, I...  No, look. I... Larry, you used to be a lot of fun.  I know, well, but, y-you know. You used to...  What ? I don't know. I don't know. Just for some reason, you've gotten so stodgy in your old age, you know ?  No, I know. Yes ! Yeah, I remember.  You know, I...  Yeah, I know. I had to explain it to you for the next six months.  Look, Larry. Look. We've got plenty of time to be conservative. You know what I'm saying ? Don't you see ?  It's to me, it's like this-this tantalizing plum has just, like dropped into our laps. I mean, life is just such a dull routine and here we are, right ? I mean, we're on the threshold of a genuine mystery. I mean, to me, the whole thing is like. It's... Hey, no.  Just don't make fun of me, okay ? Because I'm open to new experiences.  Yeah.  Sleep ?  What, are you nuts ?  Yeah.  Yeah, right. We sp...  I know... Yeah, but what about you ? Remember ? You spent the evening with Julie. Am I right ? You spent the night, and shared a...  What ?  Hey, I mean, I'm waiting for you to say something I don't agree with, okay ?  Oh. Larry.  I know. W-Well. Come on.  No, wait. I got an idea.  I know what we should do. We should get a gift, right ?  We'll surprise her. We'll sneak into the hotel. Come on.  Yeah, no. Come on.  Uh, excuse me. Hi.  Um, we were just wondering. Uh, did you see a woman come in ? She was, uh, she was a little woman, about five foot three ? She had on a gray sweater ?  Slightly older. Not...  Mrs. Caine. Oh, yes. Uh-huh. That's her.  Yes.  Yes, that's right. What room ?  Six-eleven. Really, thanks a lot.  Come on. What're you doing ?  Okay. Um, six-eleven. Six-oh-seven.  Six-eleven. Here, Larry. All right.  Um, Mrs. House ?  Hallo ? Mrs. Hou...  My God, I don't...  Ahhh ! Larry !  Oh, my God ! Wait a minute !  Oh, my God, look ! Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?  Hallo ?  Mrs...Oh, Larry.  I think she's dead.  Yeah. Oh, my God. Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?  I think that's it, Larry. I think she's dead !  Oh, my God.  Oh, God. Okay, oh God.  Okay, all right.  There's what ?  Wait a minute, wait...  We-We saw...  We... SECOND POLICE OFFICER (talking to the uniformed policeman) Mike, check the basement with...  We... She's there.  Because, I mean, she was, she was there, do you understand ?  We're-We're two professional people.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right, and I'm-I'm looking to start a little restaurant, basically French, although international cuisine would be fine. Not that I really have a location...  Okay, just...  All right.  Uh, did you check...  Yeah, b...  Yeah, but you didn't use our names, or anything like that, did you ?  No, okay.  No, I'm... No, I mean, he's in some sort of scheme, here. It's...  It's not... Oh !  All right.  Thank you. Thanks very much.  Thanks very much. Oh, man, I don't know how we're gonna...  Where is Ted ? I just don't understand where Ted is. I mean, you know, all this stuff is happening.  Do you think Helen Moss might be in on this ?  I think so.  No, think about it.  No, no, no.  I'm just beginning to calm down.  Yeah. You know, I've never seen a dead person before in my whole life.  Yeah.  Larry, is this the most exciting thing that's ever happened to us in our whole marriage ?  You know, whoever did it was probably still in the room while we were there. Probably hiding in the closet.  But you know, that probably means he saw us.  I wonder who was cremated. Who was it ?  Well, yeah, but I don't buy that.  Oh, God. If only Ted were with us, he'd have a million theories about this, I'll tell you that.  Oh, right.  Larry, the lights !  My God. This gave me the chills, honey.  I mean... Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Let's go over there now. Let's check it out. Come on. We don't have time.  Yes.  No, but look at it, Larry. Look at that. There's lights going on, there.  Oh, no, the police are red tape. Come on. This is my case, honey.  Yes, it's my case.  No, come on.  Oh, God. If only Ted were with us.  Ted... Oh, God.  Um, excuse me. We're with the Police department. We'd like to, uh, check out room, uh, six-eleven, please ?  Uh, that's right. Yes. Mm-hm. Yeah.  Ee... Ooh, um, just, uh-uh... Show him your card.  Your-Your card. Your-Your Police identification card.  Your card, you know. Your card. He's got his card.  Yeah. See ?  Thank you very much. Six-eleven ? Okay. Great.  Come on.  Okay.  Telling me to be careful. Now, just don't upset anything. Okay, Larry ?  All right, now look. The murderer must have, like, hid in this closet, right ?  Right, and then he must have...  Okay, he must have dragged the b... The body out, really fast. What ?  Oh, hi.  Oh, Jesus. Larry. I mean, really.  Just a second, Larry. Let me just look around here, just a little bit.  Larry, look. Look. I thinks that's her wedding band, Larry.  How do I know ? I saw it on her.  Yeah.  I think so.  I found it behind the door, right there.  Okay. Okay.  Didn't I tell you the police weren't thorough ? I mean they probably thought we were cranks, right ? I mean, we got no body, and... I mean, they must get fifty crisis calls a minute. Why would they bother with us ?  Just...  Oh, not the Warren Commission.  Oh, my God !  Wait a minute. Okay, all right, now look. All right. The- the elevator's probably stuck.  Relax now, Larry.  It's okay. It's okay, everything's going to be fine.  I am hitting it.  I know, I know. It's okay.  The-the idea is, there's plenty of air, in this elevator. Uh, Larry, relax. Now, if you just don't panic, okay ? Don't panic, all right ?  Now, just don't worry.  Somebody'll help us. Somebody's gonna help us. Somebody'll find us here. Hello !  Hello !  Hallo ! Hallo !  Oh, God, look just...  Yes, it's...  Shh. Shut up, Larry.  Larry, just shut up and calm down. Just, okay ? You're gonna be o...  Larry, shut up ! Hallo ! Hallo !  I know, yeah.  Okay, wait a minute. I know what. Here, just... Larry, boost me up.  Boost me up, and we'll get out there. We're gonna do it.  Yeah. Yes we can. I can do it. I can loosen it.  No, wait. No, Larry.  Come on. All right, put your hand together. Come on. Put your hand together.  No, no, it's okay.  Larry !  Larry, I mean, it's just... All I have to do is loosen that, okay.  All right, put your hand together. Put you hand together. Now give me a boost, okay ?  All right, you ready ?  Wait a second ! Wait, wait !  Oh, wait a minute, now ! Oh, just wait ! Wait, wait !  Okay, now you'd think they'd loosen this stupid thing.  Oh, my God !  So that's where he hid her.  Oh ! Oh, Larry, hold on. I'm scared.  Oh, God. What's happening ?  Oh, God, press up ! Press up !  We must be heading for the basement, Larry.  What ? What are you doing ?  I don't know where... Larry.  There's nothing out there. Wait a minute. What are you doing ?  Hey, what are you doing with matches ?  Wait a minute, what... When were you at the «Café des Artistes» ?  At the «Café des Artistes» ?  Wait. Shh ! Shh ! Shh !  Try this way.  Hey, look, look, look, look. Uh-huh.  What's this ?  All right.  Calm down.  There. Turn the light on.  Let me see.  Where... There. Oh. We're locked in here. What are you gonna do ?  Careful, now.  Don't hurt yourself.  Let's try out here.  Oh. What's down there ?  Let me see. It's okay. What ? Oh !  Yeah. I think this is it. I think this is the service entrance.  I'm trying.  I got it. I got it.  Wait ! Wait ! Did you see that ?  It looks like somebody's putting a body into a car.  I swear. Look. It's got a white sheet on it.  Right... Yeah. Come on.  No, let's follow it. I swear, there was a body in that car.  Larry !  Come on, hurry up. Hurry up !  There ! Oh !  Hurry up. Come on.  Look, look ! LARRY (voice over) Oh, my God ! It's Mrs. House's body !  Oh, my God. LARRY (voice over) Good bye, Mrs. House.  What are we gonna do ?  Oh, Larry, and tell them what ?  I mean, this guy...  You know, he's got proof his wife died of a heart attack two weeks ago. We've got no body. We've got nothing, Larry.  What ? What ? What's wrong ? What? Oh !...  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.  Hey.  H-How are you ?  Mrs. D... How are you ? Nice to see you.  Yes.  Nice to see you.  Such a sad story.  Yeah, it is. We, you know...  Yeah.  Love to.  See you later.  Oh, well, it...  What a shame.  Good night.  What ?  He... He...  You're nuts.  Wait, wait, yeah.  Okay, she's not a twin. We know she's not a twin.  What are you talking about, Larry ?  I'm calm, Larry. Okay, but okay, she's a twin, she's not a twin. I mean, now you're saying we are twins ? What are you, nuts? Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm, okay.  All right, all right.  Yeah. Yeah. Well...  No, wait a minute, wait.  But it doesn't make any sense at all, Larry, because suddenly, you know, he murders her. I mean, what's it all about ?  Wait a minute. At one in the morning ? What are you talking about ? You mean... You wanna...  All the way out to New Jersey...  Yes. Oh, yes, I'm here to tell you...  To me, it's obvious.  Obvious he's committed the perfect murder.  Okay, look. You have to start off with another woman who bears some ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House.  I know. You used the term, right.  They're with this woman.  Yeah, well, we got that far, with the exception of the actual spontaneous heart attack.  Okay, you know the husband's planning to go to Paris with this pretty young woman.  He's cheating on his wife.  So, instead of finishing the scheme they planned, he double-crosses her and kills her, taking her share of the profits.  Yeah, a good chance she's aware.  Okay, but what about Mrs. Dalton ? He claims he took her to the movies.  She's his alibi. She covered for him when he strangled his wife. She said he was at work all day.  She's a colleague who maybe loves him.  The point is, he's gotten away with the perfect murder. There are no bodies around to prove anything. And all the paperwork is strictly above board. He's home free.  Well, he doesn't care. Why should he ? Everything's been neatly disposed of. He's home free. Only he, and maybe his mistress, know the truth.  Well, j...  Hold on, hold on, for a second. We don't know this is all true. This is just a theory.  I am paying attention.  When I come back from the ladies room, I'll tell you how to trap him.  I'm surprised you two didn't drool yourself to death.  Why? Uh-huh. Yeah. Him. LARRY (voice over) I-I-I knew this.  Yeah, uh-huh. What about you ? You were gonna jump into her lap. I saw you, Larry.  Huh ?  Yeah, the only thing you didn't do is rub your hands together. That was it.  I... Well. It's not that I'm jealous.  Yeah, look who's talking. My God, I mean, you kept staring into her eyes like she was the Dragon Lady, or something.  Well, I'd just like to know if you take all your-your authors to lunch at the Café des...  Okay, I've got it.  Here's the story. Since he's gotten away with it, all we can do is bluff. As long as we have no body, we have no case.  Yeah, it's possible. He saw you there, he knows you're onto him. After he ran away, why couldn't you have retrieved the body ?  Well, that's... Okay, okay, you have the body. What does he know ? He was probably too scared to be very lucid. MARCIA (voice over) He's an amateur. He dumped the body and ran off, and then somehow - who knows the details, you two dug her out. Now, you can send him to the chair.  Okay, okay, just...  Let me tell you why he's not going to believe us, okay ?  Yeah. No, because if we really had the body, why tell him ? Why not go straight to the Police ?  If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down. TED (voice over) Oh, she's wicked. Oh, I-look... look how, look how this works out. You go to the law, what do you gain ?  Yeah, you know, wait. There's just so many fallacies in this, I can't even count them. TED (voice over) What ? Name one. CAROL (voice over) Name one? Okay, the guy looks us straight in the eyes and says, «What body? What the hell are you talking about ? Prove it».  Well, that's when we keep bluffing. TED (voice over) What ? How ? What do we do ?  We produce the body.  Yeah. Say-Say we found someone to corroborate this story. CAROL (voice over) Oh, really. J-Just...  Someone he trusted.  Like who ? MARCIA (voice over) Like his lover. Say she called and said, «Paul, I've just seen Lillian's body. They want a hundred thousand dollars for it».  Since when did I not like light reading, Larry ?  Oh, God.  What's he gonna say ?  In the book, they use several tape recorders. CAROL (voice over) In the book ?  We coordinate it.  In the book. You mean, you're basing your plan on some dumb paperback ? LARRY (voice over) This is great. This is great.  I s... No, really. LARRY (voice over) I like... No, it's great.  Oh.  He's gotten away with murder. Our only chance is to nab him as he tries to kill again, cover his tracks. LARRY (voice over) It's great. What happens, is... it provokes him to kill again. They catch him the second time. MARCIA (voice over) Exactly. He's gotten away with the first murder. LARRY (voice over) You know what I'm thinking, though ?  What ?  It's perfect.  It's perfect. It's perfect. He knows you're onto him. You shake him down.  No, no.  He comes after you, we nab him.  Yeah.  I... I just...  It's either that, or he walks.  Yeah. Yeah, wait. I... So, what you're saying is...  Wait, no, okay... What you're saying... Oh boy. You're saying, you want to provoke Mr. House into trying to murder Larry and me.  Yeah. It's perfect. You're not scared, are you ?  Hi, uh, B-twenty-four messages ? Oh, really ? Audition for what ? Did he say ? Okay, okay. Wait, hold on.  Let me get a pencil. Okay.  Yeah, well, Dad, you know, I've heard just about enough of this.  We'll let you know. That's Suzanne Raphael, right ?  Hi, there. CAROL (voice over) Hi, there. MARCIA (voice over) Hi.  Hi.  Yes, yes. Uh, I have, but, um, I have just a few questions.  Is she divorced, in this ?  Uh, recently ?  Yeah.  Oh.  Should I just begin ?  Yeah, okay.  Hello, Joe ? I-I was just... I... TED (voice over) Uh, let me stop you right there. TED (voice over) I'm sorry, I... uh, if you'll be... if you'll start out more frightened... then that'll take you where you're gonna go.  Right, right.  Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, now, and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.  Give me your hand. Hold on. Try not to fall. Hold on.  Quickly ! Hurry !  They're asking two hundred thousand dollars for it. Yeah. They say it's Monet, but I say it's a fake.  Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall.  Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, right now...  ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.  Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much right now.  Hello, Joe ? Ever since Joe came back from Vietnam...  ... he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall.  A pall.  Pall.  Pall.  Hello, Joe ? HELEN'S VOICE (distorted) Hello, Joe.  Hello, Paul ? I can't talk much, right now...  ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.  Perfect.  You did great. Great.  Well, yeah, it's, excuse me, hey, don't worry, yeah, okay.  Fantastic.  There she is.  You have to keep her busy for all afternoon.  Okay, well, it shouldn't be too hard. She's a hungry actress, you're a playwright with a role.  Good. We'll hook up later, okay ?  All right, you too.  Listen, does anybody want some guacamole or anything ?  Yeah. All right, let's go.  Yeah.  This is so insane.  Oh, w...  Oh. Yes, yes, all right.  Hello, Paul. I can't talk much right now. And if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.  They have your wife's body. They showed it to me.  They have your wife's body. They showed it to me.  Your neighbors. That's right. They want two hundred thousand dollars for it.  Hold on.  Go to a different thought.  Mm...mmm... What thought ? Wait.  You've either got to pay them off, or get rid of them.  About two hours ago.  Hold on.  Okay, let's get off as quick as possible. We've done it.  Hello, Paul. I can't talk much right now. And if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.  Hold on.  Okay, hurry up, hurry up. Okay.  What ?  You have no choice, they've got the goods. You just pay them off, or get rid of them. I have to hang up.  What's the matter, Paul ? You look all shaken up.  I worry about you these days, Paul.  You're different.  You never used to pull away from me. PAUL (getting mad) I told you to leave me alone ! I don't want to have this conversation all the time !  I have to go home and change.  I've got an appointment with a friend of Ted's about a location for... What ?  What do you mean ? Well, I meant... I just don't understand how you could give a book to Marcia, and not to me.  I just don't need...  What...  Oh, right, God. Yeah, well it's true. I guess it's true. I mean, we've got nothing in common, that's for sure. Now that, now that Nick's grown up, I mean, you know, we're just left facing each other.  Oh, right. Oh, oh, well, what about you and Marcia, huh ? What does she teach you besides poker ? That's what I'd like to know, okay ?  Look, I think the time has come for us to reevaluate our lives.  Yeah.  Well, listen, I think maybe I will go back to seeing my shrink.  Just... I just would like to be alone for a while, okay, Larry ?  Just... just, I... I... Uh, okay ?  So, I have this, like, really crazy father and everything.  And, yeah. He's wanted, like, in three states. He has a terrible driving record. So we had to move from Virginia then to New Jersey, and...  Yeah, for driving. Yeah. So I moved to Hackensack, and then... Well, anyway, I was in all these different contests and I was even, uh, Miss, uh, Teenage Passaic.  Well, after the fourth, but before the drama prize.  And... Mm... hm.  Remember ? Remember ?  «Out, out, damn spot ?» The topless «Macbeth» ?  Yeah, yeah.  Larry, Larry, help me ! I'm here, Larry !  Hallo, Paul. Didn't you expect me ?  You made a lot of promises to me, over the years. And then, you decided to dump me for that young model. PAUL (voice over) I never led you on. GLADYS (with a very harsh voice) It's late for excuses.  I'm aiming at you, lover. ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) Of course, killing you is killing myself.  Of course, killing you is killing myself. ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) It's the same thing.  But you know, I'm pretty tired of both of us.  Oh, God, Larry ! Oh, Larry, I'm so happy to see you !  Yes, I'm all right.  We... we gotta call the police, Larry.  I know. Oh, God.  Larry. Oh, God, Larry. Oh, God. Oh, honey. Oh, God. Ow ! Ow ! Oh, God ! Jesus !  Aow ! Aow ! (talking in the phone) Hello ?  Oh, God.  Oh, listen. I'll give it to you one more time.  So, he decides not to cut her in and go off to... I don't know... With his mistress and, uh, keep all the dough. So, he kills Lillian. He cremates her, or pours molten steel all over her or something... and, uh, that's when we came along and tripped him up.  Yeah, that woman that worked for him ?  Mrs. Dalton ? She covered for him. She loved him. Not that she dreamed he was a murderer.  I think they wanna be alone.  You're taking me to dinner, right ?  Why not ?  Why not ?  You'll do anything to catch a murderer, won't you ?  Oh, really one.  I know.  Oh, you know, Larry, you were surprisingly brave.  Yeah.  Well...  Well, you know... Yeah, I know, uh...  I don't know.  You know, Larry, I love you. I love you.  You were jealous of Ted.  Yeah.  You.  I...
