There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that. ...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years. ...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before. You lose! Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie? Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend. That's not true! ...That's not true. An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said. Carryin' a gun. My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once. You think Early's bad to me, don't you? Do what? Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week. No it is not! You took this picture? Your pictures. Can I see 'em? What's this? Could I try that? You can? I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking. ...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before? Better not, or Early'd whip me. Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor. Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day. You wouldn't have any color film, would ya? Is it hard to learn? Are you takin' the pictures? That French ain't it? What? One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over... ...I said, I like your hair. Hi, I'm Adele. I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people. Early! Stop!! She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen. ...I don't know. ...thank you. I don't know, they didn't speak too good English. It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth... Early, what're you doin'? Early, sing me a song. Early, can we stop there... just for a little while. How many times you gonna tell me that? Geez, they look kinda weird. Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold? What if they're dangerous? Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready. You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind. What'll we do out there? I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here. Almost. I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes. Early, you are so sweet.I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND. Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now. You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave? Nervous? Any word from that gallery?...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man. What? The police are after him, he's a murderer! Jeez... Adele! ...Anything else? What's Early been in jail for? Yeah. Adele... are you serious? You shouldn't let him do that to you... Hold still. That's me. Took 'em all. Sure. It's a portfolio of my work. I'm cool. You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want? How'd you meet Early? I haven't... I'm a fast learner. He whips you? So you don't do any of those things. You dropped this. ...Yeah, sure. Not really. ...Yeah. Karma... You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you. Karma. ...Thank you. ...Pardon? Carrie. What about you? What are you going to do? I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work. What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real! Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do! Brian I want him out of our car! Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference. I can't believe I agreed to do this. I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you? I'm finished. What's that? Look again! Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian! She told me... ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail? Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her. You sure been acting like you were... ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang. Fuck! I don't want to talk about it. You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else. Up yours. Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock? You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced? Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay. Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around. Funny, very funny. I still think we should have met them first. What did he sound like on the phone? It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you. A book on the warehouse murders? This mean your finally going to finish your thesis? Why? So how's it going? Thanks. What are you doing? Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean. No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late. Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can. I thought you wanted to be a writer. Mmm... I love it when you talk like that. It was definitely the high point of the evening. The party? Who do I have to blow to get out of here? Thank god! Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em... Like fer shurr! ...Soon as he finishes his thesis. ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries. Not yet. ...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face. You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me. ...You're hurting me... He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch! He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane. Early, just think... Siesta. No, never. Excuse me. No. ...Brian hurt his foot. No, thanks, I can manage. Where's Adele?
