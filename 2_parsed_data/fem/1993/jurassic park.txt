I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security? Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry. The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then. Remember - - viable embryos. They're no use to us if they don't survive. You shouldn't use my name.How long will this take? How would we cut off the lysine? But would we get the phones back? Wait a minute. What exactly does this mean? Two million - - great. That would help. Oh good, that'll take no time. How many lines of code are there? What one? Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up? Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike. Is that okay? Yours was fully illustrated, honey. Alan? Where are we going? You see something? The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it? You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous. You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves. Violently, if necessary. Paleo-DNA? From what source? Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?! I'll catch up with you. You can go with the others. There's only one way to be positive. I need to see some droppings. I have to see the dinosaur's droppings. Are you sure? That's pharmacological. From local plant life. These are dilated. Take a look. Six weeks? Okay, I'm following the tubing. I'm going down a passage way. How long does this stuff go for? Could you guys talk a little bit to me? Mr. Arnold? He's not answering me. Okay I'm on the grating. Look. Why? John.... Control?! You never had control! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place. So I made a mistake too. I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now. You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up. The only thing that matters now are the people we love. Alan, Lex, and Tim. And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know? John, John. John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion. And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here. That's the illusion. But you can't think through this one. You have to feel it. Carousel. Malcolm's okay for now. I gave him a shot of morphine. Alan, these aren't bones anymore. Oh my God. Oh my God. I have samples all over the kitchen. Did I say jerk? I can't get it! I can't get it unless I move! You can't hold it by yourself! Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors. I'll just finish. Yeah, I want to finish. And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too. That's what makes her sick. Good work Tim. - - barfs them up - - - - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - - - - like birds. What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - - - - the undigested state of the berries because it's - - Yeah, I know. Constantly sick. I know. It's my favorite. Oh, shit. Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?! So what are you thinking? We were right! You've got a T-rex!? He's got a T-rex! A T-rex! He said he's- - They were wrong. Case closed. This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake! The - - agility. You're right! Why would they care what we think? Small versions of adults, honey. Sattler. Okay, who's the jerk? It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now! Anything else, you old fossil? The what? Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell. Oh my god, they do not! They don't smell. Cheap, cheap, cheap. Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing. What's so wrong with kids? You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him. Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments. Velociraptor? A drought. The lake was shrinking - - If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order. They died together? Like hell it is! Why not? I can see the shed from here! We can make it if we run! Oh my God. Aw, God. Okay, I'm on channel two. We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back. You just take me through this step by step. I'm on channel two. Okay. I can't wait anymore. Something went wrong. I'm going to go get the power back on. What's that? Alan?! Do you see anything? Alan! The other car! No, no, no! The fences are electrified, right? - - shut up. Seven days?! Seven days?! Oh, great. Oh good - - clever. Faster! Shit, shit, shit, faster! Faster, faster! Can we chance moving him? Yeah. Alan? Alan? Unpredictability.... Oh, imperfections? Alan, listen to this. Uh - - thumb! The same way. I'm still not clear on Chaos. Dinosaur eats man. Woman inherits the Earth. Anti-nature. When people try to control things that it's out of their power - - And scary. I get ah - - No.Phone security systems, everything works. You ask for it, we got it! Yes. Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant! You're gonna get electrocuted electrified! Timmy! Do as he says! Timmy! Do as Dr. Grant says, quick! Do as he says! The power's coming back, Timmy! Timmy! The power is coming down, quick! Let's go! Please! What's that? I like cows. Go away! All night? What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep? What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more? Dorkatops! Oh, I hate the other kind. Hear that? Are you hearing this? Alright. It's safe. It's safe? Liar! You said you wouldn't leave! He left us! He left us! Dad - - Dad - - He's knocked out! He's knocked out! Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant! Daddy, daddy! Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant! You're gonna get electrocuted electrified! The power's coming back! Jump, Timmy! It's too late! That's not funny. What? I'm a hacker! They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals. And these are herbivores. No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop! Stop! Stop! Don't let the monsters come over here! They don't bother me. Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong? I don't know! I'm sorry! I don't know, I don't know. I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - - What's going to happen to the goat? He's going to eat the goat?! We love the presents. We miss you.
