Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem. 'Drugged' is a stupid word. Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised. Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess. FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT. I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet. Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear. ......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwet�kame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag. Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy. Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink. No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it." Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.' About... Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich�s and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl. Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend... Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores? Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard. But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte. She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City. The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture! Is everything getting worse? What do you believe in then? Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink? The Clock People? Siwash, huh? Clockworks? What was that? But I don't know how to polka. Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help... I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's. Where are the others? You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling. Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving. I don't. I'm staying with the Countess. If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts.... But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years. No, I guess not. How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here? So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes? That's Jellybean! You don't agree with Debbie, then? What is Debbie's position? Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink? You're political, then? About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl. Tell me about it. No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone. Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast. My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore. I have to go, Julian. Getting dressed. I've got to go. It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds. I'm cold. As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace. When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways. I'm the best. Yep. I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off. I was a successful model once. American Cheese. The king of road food. Going north? I don't know anything about it. Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However... What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship? Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think... But Countess... If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him? The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings. A job for me? Your ranch? Bonanza Jellybean? Does that mean you might have an assignment for me? I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be. A born freak can only go uphill. Tired...
