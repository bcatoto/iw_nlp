(On radio, faint) Explorer, please verify that the P1 ATA removal on replacement cap part 1 and 2 are complete. (On radio, faint) Copy that Explorer. Dr Stone-Houston, requesting status update... Installation ninety-five percent complete. Running level one diagnostics on circuits, sensors, and power. Standby. Standing by. Looks like we're on schedule. Dr. Stone, Medical is concerned about your ECG readings. I'm fine Houston. Well, medical doesn't agree doctor. Are you feeling nauseous? Not any more than usual, Houston. Diagnostics are green. Linking to communications card. Ready for data reception. If this works, when we touch down tomorrow, I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks. That's a date, doctor. Just remember, Houston is partial to Margaritas. OK, here we go... Booting comm card now. Please confirm link. Houston, please confirm reception of data. Negative. We're not seeing any data. Stand by, Houston. I'm gonna reboot the comm card. Standing by. Please expand. Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalsky. As Houston recalls, she took off in your '74 GTO. Engineering requests fuel status on the jet pack prototype. Engineering says thank you. We know the Corvette story, Matt. Especially engineering. We're going to miss you, Matt. Comm card reboot in progress. Thank you doctor. Shariff, what's your status? Could you be more specific? Indeterminate estimates make Houston anxious. Hubble Telescope engaged. Upgrade fully functional. That applause you hear is for you, Shariff. Congratulations. Kick back, take the rest of the day off. Matt, please advise as to Mission Specialist Shariff's current activity. Dr. Stone. Houston. Medical now have you with a temperature drop to 35.9 and heart rate rise to 70. How are you doing? Houston, I'm fine, it's just... ...Keeping your lunch down in zero G is harder than it looks. Doctor Stone? Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer? No, we've been here for a week Houston, let's just finish this. That's a negative. I'm afraid we're getting nothing on this end, doctor. Try again. (a beat, then...) Still nothing. Houston, could you please turn that music off? Kowalsky? Thank you, Kowalsky. Now, Houston? Negative. Could Houston be misinterpreting the data--? We're not receiving any data. Engineering is recommending a vis- check for component damage. Mmmm. Let me see what's going on. What have you got here? Visual examination doesn't reveal any damaged components. The problem must be originating in the comms panel. That seems to be the case. Engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen. That's as close to an apology as you're going to get from them. We should've listened to you doc. I'm on it. Copy that. How long do you think it'll take you? An hour. Outstanding. We appreciate your patience, Doctor. Installing your system in the Hubble is the main purpose of this mission. Matt, It's been a privilege. Enjoy your last walk... Assistance appreciated. Permission granted. Certainly. Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble dried. Whoa...! AWOL! Thanks. Sorry. In my basement lab things usually fall to the floor. Call me a genius if I can get this board initialized in the next hour. Explorer, this is Houston. NORAD reports a satellite has incurred a missile strike. The impact has created a cloud of debris orbiting at 20,000 miles per hour. Current debris orbit does not overlap with your trajectory. We'll keep you posted on any developments. Should we be worried? Explorer, engage arm and pivot to cargo bay. I was just happy that they didn't cut the funding to my research. Six months. Assuming it works, it's just for hospital use. This one is a prototype. My eyes are brown. Mm-hm. The silence. I could get used to it. Houston, from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead. Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary? You're the expert, doctor. It's your call. Please elaborate. That is affirmative. Surprisingly, control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras story. Please proceed. Proceeding to over ride. ISS, this is Houston. Zlotze Houston. Explorer, this is Houston. Mission abort. Repeat: mission abort. Initiate emergency disconnect from Hubble. Begin re-entry procedure. Start Deorbit Prep for PLS at Kennedy. ISS, initiate emergency evacuation. Debris from the impact has caused a chain reaction, hitting other satellites in its path and creating new debris. Norad reports that orbital and ballistic effects are driving the cloud of debris up toward your altitude. How copy? I can't. If I turn it off now we'll lose the whole system. Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done. We have a full on chain reaction. It's been confirmed that it is the unintentional side effect of the Russians striking one of their own satellites. Explorer, new data coming through. It's not good. Most of our systems are going down. Debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding. Multiple sats are now down and they keep on falling. Most of them. Telecomunications systems are gone. Expect a communication blackout at any moment. Kowalsky, visual of debris at nine o'clock. You're a go for TH1138. Repeat You're a go for TH1138 procedure. Dr. Stone requesting faster, faster transport. Attention. New data suggests immediate evacuation absolu... Dr. Stone requesting faster transport to the bay area. Explorer get me down. I'm trying... It's stuck! Nooooo! No. I can't! (She pulls herself together) Ok. Ok. I'm trying. I'm trying. Ok. I'm trying! I can't it's stuck, Hold on. Yes. Yes. I copy. I'm detached! I don't know. I don't know! I'm spinning. I can't. I can't. GPS is...down. I can't, it's down, I can't. I told you! Nothing. I see nothing! It's too fast. I can't breathe. I can't...breathe... Houston, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.. I'm drifting but I have a visual of Explorer. With North at 12 o'clock, the Shuttle is at the center of the dial. I can see the Chinese station. No, no, no, it's the International Space Station. ISS is at 6, no, 7 o'clock. Lieutenant Kowalsky, do you copy? Explorer, do you copy? Houston, do you copy? Houston, this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. I'm off structure and I'm drifting. Do you copy? Anybody...? Anyone...? Please copy. (almost to herself) Lieutenant Kowalsky?... YES! YES! I copy! I'm here! My light? Here! Here! I'm... I'm alright... I'm fine. 3.6 psi, I think. Steady at eight percent...no seven... Copy. Please hurry. Oh. Sorry. Arghh! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Ohh I got it. No... No... No... Wait... Don't. Nooooooo!!!! Dammit!!! Ahh Dammit! Ahhh Dammit. Why aren't they answering? Can they hear us on an alternate frequency? Why ninety? 02 down to six percent. Yeah. Pretty scary shit. Where is he? Where is he? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm trying. I'm trying. I got him. I got him. 02 down to five percent. I apologize for not complying. I should've stopped working as soon as you instructed me to. Yes? Agreed. 02 down to two percent. What? Home? Lake Zurich. Illinois. I don't know... The radio. I listen to the radio... Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as they don't talk. I just drive... No... I had a daughter. Sarah... She was four. Stupidest thing- a school trip to the swimming pool. She was playing tag- she slipped, hit her head, and that was it... She loved tag. I'm sure she was laughing. When I received the call I was driving and ever since that's what I do. I wake up, I go to work and then I just drive. 02 down to one percent. Uhuh? Mmm...Mmmm. I'm red lining... My O2 tank pressure is low... Shouldn't we be turning? We're Break... You have to break. I got it. I got it. The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm I'm detached. I've got you. I've got you-- No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you. Don't. Don't. NO Gotcha! What? No-- No! I'm not letting you go! We're fine. You're not going anywhere, you're not Please don't do this. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. I had you! I had you. My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm went off. Yes. Yes. I see it. I see it. Yes. Ok. Sunday drive...? I've never flown a Shenzhou-- Ok. Only on a simulator. I crashed it. I-- Every time. I crashed the Simulator every time. I'm going to take the Soyuz and come get you. No. I'm coming to get you. But... I... I'm... I'm going to make it. Dad wanted a boy. Not yet. What? You... you have beautiful... you have beautiful blue eyes. What? No... I'm coming to get you. (in a daze) Matt... Matt! Come on, come on. OK. Where are you? Where are you? Comms. Comms... There you are! Matt. This is Ryan. Copy? Matt. This is Ryan. Copy? Matt, I made it. I'm here. I'm inside the Station... Do you copy? Come on Matt. Talk to me. Tell me where you are. Give me your position... Where are you? Give me a visual... tell me what you see. Oh, come on. You've been yammering nonstop since we left Cape Canaveral, and now you decide to shut up? Come on Matt, talk to me! Say something... Anything. Tell me about Mardi Gras. Tell me about the hairy guy. What happened? Oh Matt. I'm not ready for this. Houston in the blind. This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the ISS... All communication with Mission Commander Matthew Kowalsky has been lost. Radio transmission is absent. Visual is nonexistent. To confirm, I--Ryan Stone--am the sole survivor of STS-157. What now? OK... where was it?... where was it? Where is the power?... Here you are. Good... good... just like training... Undocking... undocking... Yes... red... Ok... Ok... I remember this... undocking... We don't have four minutes to spare. We're going manual... Okay. Arming the system... Firing the pyros... Rezerv rasstyk! I engaged manual control- R O A K and RYD are activated. Oh, no. No, no, no. Great. Fantastic. Perfect. Clear skies but with a chance of satellite debris. Okay. We detach this and we go home. Piece of cake. Oh shit. Shit! No... no... no.. I hate space. Shut up! Ok. Alright. That's good. Okay, let's stabilise you. Ok. Let's visit the Chinese station. Houston in the blind, Tiangong is approximately 100km... to the west and I am off it's course by about 3 degrees. I will correct trajectory. Ok. Ok. I'll engage main thrust in five... four... three two... one... One... One... one... Come on. Come on! You gotta be kidding me. Where's your backup? Where's your goddamn backup?! This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston. Houston! This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. Do you copy! (into the mouthpiece) Houston, you're coming in over the AM frequency. Please confirm identity. Han... ni... ts... Repeat. This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone from STS-157. Do you copy? Hannik ya itc... pini. Is this the Chinese Station? Is this Tiangong? Copy? Do you speak English? Hannic ya itcitem pini! S.O.S. Do you understand? Uumaruq taigaa! Mayday! Can you copy? Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Yes! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Aningang! Aningang? Mayday, Aningang! Aningang, Mayday! Aningang...? (then, realizing:) Is that your name? Aningang is your name?! Aningang! Mayday! Suli, suli! No, Mayday's not my name. I'm Stone, Dr. Ryan Stone-- I need help. Mayday! Ieukpalliktuq uumaruq taigaa naabuqtuq. Dogs... Are those dogs? Those are dogs! Are you calling from Earth?! Where are you, Aningang? Is the sun out? Are there birds? Are there trees? Can you smell the ocean? Ieukpalliktuq naabuqtuq. Is it beautiful where you are? Here it's colder than hell and lonelier than shit, but it's beautiful Aningang. Utterly, terrifyingly beautiful. Make your dogs bark again, Aningang. Will you? Please... Suli aasrivak aatqatik niuruq...? Dogs! Woof. Woof. Woof. Auuu. Auuu. Oipmiq. Oipmiq! Auuu. Auuu. Woof. Woof. Auuu... Auuu... I'm going to die, Aningang. I mean, we're all going to die. Everyone knows that. But I'm going to die today... Funny that. To know. And you know what Aningang... I don't care. I don't care if I die. I don't have anything... not anymore. But the thing is... I'm still scared. I'm really scared... No one will mourn me. No one will pray for my soul. Will you mourn me, Aningang? Is it too late to say a prayer? I'd say one for myself, but I have never prayed in my life... no one ever taught me how... No one ever taught me how... A baby. There's a baby with you. Ieukpalliktuq upatimi... You are singing to your baby? Is that a lullaby? That's so sweet! I used to sing to my baby too. I hope I see her soon. (growing ever drowsier) That's nice. Keep singing, Aningang, just like that. Sing me to sleep. I'll sleep and sleep and sleep. Sing to me, Aningang... sing...sing.... No... no.. don't. How did you? But how did you? How? You never told me where. No. We can't. There's no fuel. I tried everything. I tried everything. They're for landing so. I never got to land the simulator, I told you. And I crashed it every time. How did you get here? What? Landing, landing. Landing is launching. Okay, landing, landing, landing is green. Okay, okay landing, alright. Soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing. ... you're a clever son of a bitch Matt. So to land I need to get rid of the BO and Engine module, okay? Listen to me Matt. You're going to see a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah, her hair is probably a mess. That's okay, she doesn't like to brush it. Tell her mommy found her red shoe. She was so upset about that shoe Matt, but tell her it was right under the bed. You give her a big hug and a kiss for me and tell her mamma misses her. Tell her she's my little angel and that she makes me so proud, so so so proud, and that I promise I'll try and make her proud too. You tell her that I'm not quitting, that I'm going to keep fighting. You tell her I love her Matt... I love her so much. Tri module separation, go... Okay Houston, here comes the tricky part, the Soyuz has to think we're only three meters above the earth. Let's reset you then. Okay. I only have one shot at this. One shot... What's the point if we don't try? Wow... you were right Matt... it's magnificent.... You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You keep dropping and you're going to kiss the atmosphere. But not before I get to you. You have my last ride home. Okay, I'm done with just driving. Let's get go home. Ahhhhhh! Come on. Come on. Seriously? In the Soyuz the power button is erm....here! Ah, ok ah undocking, undocking....eenie, meenie,... Ok. That doesn't sound good.... Miini... moh... No hablo chino. Mini... moh... Okay....okay... Good...good...There. And this should be... Okay... Houston in the blind... This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the Shenzhou. I'm about to undock from the Tiangong and I have a bad feeling about this mission. Reminds me of a story, Houston-- Okay, you know what, Houston? Never mind the story... It's getting hotter in here. The way I figure it, there's only two I either make it down in one piece and I'll have one hell of a story to tell... ...Or I burn up in the next ten minutes. Whichever way it goes, no harm no foul. Because either way-- It'll be one hell of a ride. I'm ready. Yeehaaa! Ahhhhhhhh! AAAHHHHHH! Thank you. Ahhhhh!!!
