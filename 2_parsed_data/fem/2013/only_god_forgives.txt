Not this evening. He's not coming in. I tell him to stay away. He hurt one of my girls Julian. Not good... Put him in jail. Keep him as a pet? What if they just let him go? They could ask him...? Very nicely? What happened? I'd like to check in now please. I'd like to speak to your manager. Listen to me... I've just travelled six thousand miles to see the corpse of my first born son and I haven't slept for thirty hours and he says I can't go to my room. How much? ...Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the fucking key... Don't leave the money there. Some cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket. Put it in your pocket. Put it in your fucking pocket. Hey... Open this. I need a drink. Well don't just stand there... I loved him so much you know... Billy... Everyone loves their children don't they? Well, not everyone, but... Do you want to see a picture? What, yeah, thanks. Could it be have been one of the gangs? What do you mean? But you're going to find out who did it, right? No, it needs to be you that does it. We need to show them. Do you understand what I'm saying? Good. Did you kill him? Complicated? He killed my son... What's so fucking complicated about that? Don't tell me to calm down. I want him dead. We don't forgive. Only God does. How? What are you talking about? I don't care. Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered your brother and we're not going to let him get away with it. The Angel of fucking what...? 'Restores' things? Who said anything about 'restoring' things? I don't know what kind of spiritual journey you're on, but you will kill How's business? What d'you mean? I'm here. Julian's here. What's gotten into him...? Is he high or something? Nothing? Not like you... So tell me... What did he mean when he said it was complicated? So we kill them both. Okay. Well how about we start with the guy we do know? Sorry I'm late. What's wrong? See anyone you want us to take home tonight? What? What's with you? You want to get high? Is she here? D'you want me to? Why d'you want me to meet her? What, like we're a couple? Last night. He went out. None. Someone called him. Someone called his mobile. She doesn't know. They spoke in English. Window. Do you like the table? What is it? What is it? What is it? Why not? You're kidding? This is insane. So... May, isn't it? How long have you two known each other then? ...that sounds about right. Well it's always a rare treat to meet one of Julian's lady friends. So, where did you two meet? I hear that happens a lot in this part of the world... Tell me, what's your line of work, Mai? I work in the service industry. I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before you started serving my son, how many cocks were you serving? Was it over a thousand? I know girls like you. Just because you might be pulling the wool over my son's eyes don't think it's going to work with me. I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by and let a dirty little hooker take advantage of my son in the vain hope that her womb isn't so diseased that she can trick him into impregnating her and putting another cocksucking child on to this earth. What do you know about what's good? He's good to me... Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really happy for you-- Oh really, shame that, still, live by the sword, die by the sword... I did what had to be done. Who? D'you kill him? Cause he as good as killed Billy. What I want to know is, what are you going to do about it? Yes you are. You're going to do it for me and you're going to do it for your brother. That's right you cunt, cause you always run away whenever there's a problem... just like you're running away from killing this fucking Angel of whatever Chang?! I should be going now. Sit down you cunt. So what am I left with? You're right. We're family. We stick together. But Billy was family too. That's it. I'm not listening to this. I don't ever want to hear you mention his name again... Do you hear me? You could have protected him. I would've done anything for him. Okay, he wasn't born with as many advantages as you were. He struggled with things. But I always stood by him. Don't you dare blame me for what happened back then. You would've been a great fighter... You could've gone pro. At least you're not behind bars and that's more important to me. Surprise me. Well that seems sensible... And what do you hope that's going to achieve? And when you lose, what's going to happen then? Do you understand what he's talking about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking a clue. I hope you find what you're looking for. 'Cause if you don't, it's going to find you and I'm not always going to be there to look after you. Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you again soon. Are you alright? Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you know. You're a piece of work, aren't you? No fucking hanging about with you, is there? I bet you do. We'll have to something about that the, wont we? But, first things first, what about Chang? My son's guardian angel. Good, then he won't be to hard to kill, will he? What did you have in mind? I didn't say it was easy. But then, you're a resourceful man, aren't you? Well then you're going to have to find someone who's not a fucking Thai then, aren't you? Don't you worry about that. There are certain things that a mother and son shouldn't - and don't - discuss... What are you doing? I'm going to go. It's fine, but you know... It's not my style. Maybe you should give it to your mother. Come on Julian. She's a fucking bitch. The way she talks to you -- What? 'Don't talk about my mother'? Come on Julian. Why don't you fuck her instead of me? You're fucked. Fuck you. You really want to know? He killed my son. This is Bangkok. Nothing's that expensive. Yes... I'm a salesman. Some of the things I sell aren't exactly legal... But I'll give you the man that hired the hit... As for myself, I'm not scared of paying for what I've done. I just... just don't hurt my son. Skylight bar at the Jupiter.. Every night. What about me? I hope life treats you kind And I hope you have all you've dreamed of... And I wish you, joy and happiness. He doesn't want to see anyone. Just give him time... ...tell him I came? Of course. We'll get him through this together. You deserved to win. You should've I'll never get use to seeing you get hurt - even when you win. And did it make a difference? I want to know... Did it make a difference? And how do you feel now? Don't you see, that's how I felt when Billy died... What d'you think I want? I want it to be like it used to be... I don't want to lose you... He knows... He knows it was me. He's going to come after me. And after he's come after me, he's going to come after you. I'm scared, Julian. What are we going to do? Not just him. We've got to take them all out. Kill them all. The final solution. The monsters were angry. They bit it off. These were new monsters. The woods are full of them. What's wrong Dad? Li Hom. And by the way... Congratulations. Last night. Everyone in the station's talking about it. I came here to collect my son's body. Now it's released, my business in Bangkok is completed. Tonight. I've had no real contact with Julian since he ran away. I watched him lose. And he deserved to. You were the better fighter. My only sadness is that Billy got caught up in what he's doing out here. And paid for it with his life. I'll never testify against my own flesh and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a killer. ... It pains me to say it, but my own son is a killer. He killed a cop back in England ten years ago. He's been on the run ever since. I say son... But he hasn't been a son to me. Not for a long time. Not since he killed that cop back home... That was ten years ago. He's been running ever since. And he'll never stop until he's caught. Until you catch him. Someone else is out there now... Hold on... Kanita - go to your room. ... go to your room now. What happened to you? Who did this to you? Come with me... ...to Cambodia - we can hide there... You'll be safe there. Now? Wait outside... Let's go. Five minutes.
