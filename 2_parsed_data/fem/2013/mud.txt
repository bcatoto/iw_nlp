I just want to have a conversation. I just want to talk about it. Mary Lee sits down across from Senior, who doesn't look up from his paper. Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger toward him. You're Neckbone right? You look like a good enough kid. A word of advice, don't grow up to be like your shit heel uncle. Hey! You hear me? You treat a woman like a princess. Got it?! Yes. I'm gonna turn in. Let's sit down for dinner tonight okay? Will you make it home by seven? Stop it! She shoves the Skinny Kid, but he continues laughing. You didn't have to do that. Do I know you? How old are you? Fourteen? You know you just punched a Senior? You think you're pretty tough. What else do you know? Hello? Oh. May Pearl! Let's go! Okay! You're late. Ellis doesn't speak, he doesn't look at her. He enters his room and shuts the door. He's heard the news and she knows it. Mary Lee's face drops. Time to get up. She begins picking clothes off the floor. Ellis, in bed, raises up on his elbows. He's tired from a late night. I'm going to Wal-Mart. I need you to come with me. Come on. She pulls the covers off of him. Ellis I know what your father told you last night. That's not what I wanted. I wanted to sit you down and talk about it. I've spent my whole life on that boat. I don't think it's too much to ask for your... Of course. No sir. No sir. We will officer. My lord. (rolls up her window) You look nice. What time are you gonna be home? Ellis shrugs. She looks at him as the car radio rambles. About moving in town? You can't make other people change Ellis. If I'm unhappy then I'll have to be the one to change something. Ellis chews on the inside of his cheek and watches her avoid eye contact. He shoulders his way out of the car. Mary Lee takes a moment before driving off. As Mary Lee pulls away, Ellis takes in the scene. But you're not scared if you have to. They're all right. I don't know all of `em. Why do you say that? How do you know that? But I like you. A bracelet? Thank you. Take your hands off him Senior! Ellis? Senior. Don't you blame this on me. One doesn't have a thing to do with the other and you know it. You're a man who's never had the strength to support his own life. I never asked you for a thing, and I've never took a thing from you that I couldn't provide for on my own. If they do tear my home apart the only joy I'll have in my heart is knowin' that they'll be tearing you out of my life for good. She said she didn't like him that much. I told her I thought he was all right. What? Ellis! Kyle! Stop it Kyle! You can't just run up and punch people I'm with! Why would I call you back Ellis? I'm not your girlfriend! We went on one date. One! That doesn't matter! But what Ellis?! What did you expect?! You're fourteen! What? Ellis is losing it. His eyes are red. He looks at the crowd of kids. There are smiles and some snickering. May Pearl is speechless. She just stares at him. Ellis turns and walks back to the dirt bike. May Pearl's girlfriends gather around her. She shakes her head, dumbstruck. Ellis lifts the bike off the ground. He looks back at May Pearl who appears to be shrugging off the whole affair in front of her friends. Ellis speeds off. Just stay calm. What's going on? It's okay. You're okay. Just set back. Mary Lee guides Ellis back down on the pillow. Senior stands with his arm on her shoulder. They look down at their son. You're home. We got you home. Ellis takes a second to get his bearings. His mother lifts a glass of Sprite up to his mouth. He takes a sip. The doctors gave you some medicine. You had a snake bite. A man brought you in. No one knew him. Ellis tries to sit up in bed, but his mother stops him. I'll be back in to check on you but just try and sleep if you can. We love you too Ellis. They exit the room. Ellis rests his head back on the pillow and takes a deep breath.
