Meaning you didn't like it. What did you think of the music? How was I? Tell me honestly. Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn. The marriage! Did you know? Had you heard? Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste. Why? What does he look like? Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway. Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it. Oh! What's that? Where? Why not? How do you know? Is there a part for me? And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true? Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart. Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year! Maestro. No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang? I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that. Is she a good fuck? I'm so relieved. Is her mother still lying on the floor? Don't bother. Don't bother!I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here. Yes! I want to go back to Vienna. I want to go! Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please! Why not? Give me one reason I can understand. Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard. Why? Why not? What's that? Oh! Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this? I heard voices. Who was that? Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money. Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand. I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common. When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it. You're not going to do this? I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment? Your father is dead. Wolfi! Your father is dead. These gentlemen are from Salzburg. Wolfi. No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we? Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can - She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you. I don't know. There's a young girl to see you. Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here. Wolfi! May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart? Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart. I love you! I love you! No! Tell them to go! Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody. This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity! All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that? How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg? Yes! Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that! No, they will not. I know how things work in this city. One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life! I think you're mad! You're really mad! Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now? Eat my - ah! Eat What? Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you! Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that. No! No, I'm not playing this game. Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse! Yes, you are. You're very sick. Oh, ha, ha, ha. Do you think that's funny? That's stupid. Why not? Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man. Fartsbishop! Where? No! No! No! Stop it! I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go. He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please. This is not his handwriting. And I'm asking you - No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please. Well, thank you very much. You can go now. Why you? What are you doing here? Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous. I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go? But! I'm a married woman! What do you mean? What for? Tonight? Oh, thank you, sir! Oh yes. He's really proud of his work. Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies. Yes. That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals. Thank you very much, Your Excellency. Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted! No, sir. This is my own idea. My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come. I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here. Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait. He's terribly busy, sir. That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment. Excellency! Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor. Who are you? Money! Money! You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff! He's doing his best. Leave him alone! He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you. Not at all. How much will you pay him? Do you hear him? Do you? Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper! And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat. Well, this is none of your business. Whoever sent you is going to pay, no? What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time. In three months! Papa. Oh, yes.What a strange young man. Michael! Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning. It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude. I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man. You can't be Herr Mozart! Upstairs. I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her. Just one year. Wine? Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate? Ah, now! Here she comes.Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened. I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera. I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead. Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over. I don't know. He has pains. You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse. I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared! In there, sir. I think I've found out about the money, sir. Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir. Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat. Not that I've seen. Oh, thank you, sir. Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir. Yes, thank you, sir. I will, sir. Good morning, sir. Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish. They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous. My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you. Are you Herr Mozart?Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence! Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable! Do you know who I am? This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests! Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you. Of course now. Right away, before I get any older. Well, promise then. Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you. I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish. Here I am, my angel.Right in here. The big show starts in one minute. I feel like I'm spying on Rick. You're kidding. What do you mean? What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party? No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision. He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow. Bobbie, what are you talking about? I'm going now, Cole. Cole, I'm sorry, I... I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else. Cole, I'm marrying Rick. Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you... No, Cole, I... Cole, we've got to talk. Cole? You're so romantic... Yeah. Let's get naked. Yes... I don't believe you. And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment. The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life. Let go of me! Rick, you're lying! I can't trust you! Why don't you get undressed. Don't turn on the lights, sugar. I'll lead you around. I love you. Have a good time. Don't make it too late. Your mother's not dead. You're really pissing me off. Remember, you promised... no screwing around. Can't I just go with you guys? Gonna get married... You better not have too much joy. Um... that's very relaxing. That feels so great. Before or After I have my nervous breakfown? The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party... I don't know... I just feel scared. Stop fooling around... I need to talk. I can't sleep. Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy. I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers. Are you going to have women at your party? It looks awful. You're going to have a bachelor party? Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun. I think your dinner's burning. What are we having? God, you're a slob. Ilene, are you crazy? Let's go. That doesn't mean it was Rick's party. Are you sure this is a good idea? Ilene, Rick promised... Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick. I hope those guys are all right. Quiet, Mother. Ilene, we don't really know that. Why is Cole here? Great, Mom.I know what I'm doing... Go! Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it! Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men. Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party. Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs. Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble? If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.I hope Ilene's all right. What kind of job? I'm a housewife. A strange wang right in my palm. You know your father enjoys his company. I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year. It's all right... So have I. You've been having strange sex...! Ed... you're kinky! You can tell a man by his friends. Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch. Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade? Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.Look at that guy. What a hunk. I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex. Really -- you went with him for two years. ...Really? What's happening?Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is. There can be no excuse for tardiness. You're late again, Rick.Of course. I'm separated. Klupner. Mrs. Klupner.It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for. We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you! No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been -- Finally! What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you! I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out! No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman... Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife? Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready! Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner? He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken". You should have been there... Hard to believe, isn't it...? You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about. And they don't even know what it really is. I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted. Anymore ideas...? What above the curves?! I can't! What're we going to do?! You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you... I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you. So now they believe me. Indy? Did you talk to them? I want to go home... What? They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ... You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory! Down? Down there?! Are you crazy! Wait -- what're you doing? Let's go! Let's get out of here! Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him! What is it...? Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving! I am -- it looks horrible! There's a hole! I found a square hole! I can't find any lever! Help me Indy! A what?! There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me! I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing! What?! Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off! Oh no -- oh no!! Get -- the -- bug -- off! No -- don't you see -- crawling -- Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes... Dr. Jones? We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open. Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones? You're dying to come into my room, aren't you? Primitive sexual practices? Yeah -- and nothing else. That shock you? You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave? Not leftovers? I've never been so hungry in my life... That's the Maharajah -- that kid?! She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub. Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner... You mean we have to walk the rest of the way? He's afraid of something. Just try and control yourself. I'd be safer sleeping with that snake. You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village? That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest? What does the writing say? Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones? Oh really? Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince. Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got. He'll be okay. He's a good kid. Where'd you find your little bodyguard? Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes! It's starting to let go! Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me! THE WHAT?! PET IT??!! Just one arm! What?! It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something! It's pulling me deeper! What?! Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?! A SNAKE!! A snake! Indy! Help me! Somehow I feel safer in here. Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach. What'd he say now? Their children? Took what? God, I am starving, but I can't eat this... Dream -- nightmare is more like it. What do you mean -- how? What'd he say? Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in -- No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead. Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway? Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing! I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me. So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer? Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam... I'll take the extra ticket. Where's this plane going anyway? What're we going to do?! Where're we going?! You don't look very good. Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl! For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?! Who cares? Where's that diamond! Hey, he's not a waiter... I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry! I'm going to puke in it... Give me your hat... Figures... This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left. You got it!Oh my god, oh my god... How can you tell? What happened? That needle sank like a rock. What the hell are dreams, anyway? Thank God. It's just made her think... her dreams are real... Since the murder. She was fine before that. Please, Nancy. Trust us. They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here. I sure as hell hope so. No, nothing. They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before. No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more. Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you... Guess I should'n'a done it. I don't even have it on me, so forget it. Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep. Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side... Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that. Your father the cop. That's a good one. Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me. Dead and gone. S'curity. Nancy! Put that damned thing down! But that's just not reality, Nancy! I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but -- I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee! Okay... You need anything, just call. You okay? Nancy? Take this, it'll help you sleep. And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change. No television, forget the homework, no phone calls. To bed with you, c'mon. You okay? It happens all the time. I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed? I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know. Get into bed. Nancy, don't fall asleep in there. Right home after. Did you sleep? I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school. Where you think you're going? Maybe you don't think murder's serious -- Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight. You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile... You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh? Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out. If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts. Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up. My dream. Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out. Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next. The killer. Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to. Listen, I... I know who he is. Much better. Hi. I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura. Great. What happens if they don't do that? And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what? Yeah. No. And if you can't do that, you sleep. Just checking -- keep out of sight! Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do... Okay? It's nothing too hard or anything. I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay? Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask. You believe in anything? You believe in the Boogey Man? Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off. You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen? M'god, I look twenty years old. You have any weird dreams last night? Not really. Guess I did. Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street. Yeah. Something slippery all over here... Tina? Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape! Because he was scary, that's why. Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves. Then bring us back its tail and whiskers. Worked like a charm. DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE! Deal. And you'll be here to catch him, right? That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him. -- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that? Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to. Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay? I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please. You know he's dead though, right? Hi daddy. I know what happened. Dad -- what you doing here? You don't know he did it. Just want to talk to him a second. Dad, I want to see Rod Lane. You used me, daddy! She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone. She dreamed this would happen... Rod's not a lunatic. Okay. Hi, dad. Feeling better? Just sleep now, Mom. Give me the key, mother. All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house? Go on... So he's alive? I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know! I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy. Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger. What's with the bars? Screw sleep! It's real, Mamma. Feel it. What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams. Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined? Go even crazier? Okay. Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep. I must be going nuts... Right. Yes, Mother. G'night. No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother. Great Warm milk. Gross. Mother, for petesakes. What? I will. I won't. Right home after. See you. I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know? School. It wasn't that serious... No. What you mean 'all at once'? Well then how can you say somebody else was there? How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it? And then what happened? The door was locked from your side. You were screaming like crazy. Nobody's gonna kill you. He doesn't know you. Couldn't you change? We should get her out of here... I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out... Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous. Nice to have a fire. Right. Well, she didn't, exactly... Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy. He's nuts about you.What you dream? Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac. Really. Turn 'er up a little. I can't believe his mother let him come over here. Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all. So what you dream? Yeah, nuts. Rod says the sweetest things. When did you have a nightmare? No more fights. Jungle man fix Jane. Of course. What's that? What the hell you doing here?I'll go... Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life. It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood. ... How long? And Spock with it. They are joined together. And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come? So, like your father, you changed the rules... Did your collaborator know? Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable. Why? It's time for total truth between us. This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it? I have already made one transmission too many... That may be difficult... Logic indicates that is the case. It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack. Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out. Spock's burial robe. But... How could they have evolved so quickly...? David -- My readings indicate great instability. Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging. ... Or who . Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading. ... Radiation residual... Level is minimal... As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data. New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three... Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form... Negative, on surface... A manufactured object. Same sector. Metallic mass. You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created. ... Fascinating. Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature -- Temperature decreasing rapidly -- Like your father... so human. All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius. Captain, what's happening?! I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir. None that I can detect, sir. Request permission to beam aboard immediately. Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please... Do you have an explanation? Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate. I'll try to remember that, Captain. Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level. Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted... If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form. Much is at stake... . He will remain always as he is. Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it. The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body. Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible. The Genesis planet is gone. Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us... He gave his life to save us. That is all I know. He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet. Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance. Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous. All my hopes. Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor. Gentlemen. Good evening. How is Doctor McCoy, sir? Would you look at that? Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver. No, sir, no response. This isn't reality. This is fantasy. I am going to do nothing about it. You are going to sit in the closet. All true. Good for you, Lieutenant. You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it. Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant. How is that...?Soon, Captain... Quite soon. Put me on the hailing frequency. He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.Do you have a good map of Death Valley? We're only going to be here a few hours... Credit card. I'll take that. You have one with two beds? How much are your rooms? Thank you. Where's that? What was your last stop? Where did you stop last? Where did you stop last? No!!! No!!! I won't let anyone hurt you. If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up. I want to speak to Marc Shermin. He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone. Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book. Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again? I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home. No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride. I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home. I will. I'm never going to see you again, am I? You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.' Well... I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye. Where do you think you're going? Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you. Where? I'm sure we could find a country and western station. How long will it take you to get home? Yes. Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby? I'd like to... This is yours... We can. What will you say about us? It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything. Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary. It'll tell you pretty much everything about us... If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass. The cook again? I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine. You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship. This is crazy. We don't have time for this. Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore. What for? You don't make money gambling. You lose it. I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby. But... Yes, they are. Oh, you're pretty... No, they don't talk... We talk to them. Hello... hello. How are you this morning? You don't forget anything, do you? Good morning. Nothing. You're damn right I am. We'll get a ride in the morning. Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning. Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late? We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand? What are you saying? What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm. I will. I will. We still have another day. No one's traveling in this weather. We're not going to get a ride tonight. Where did you learn that? We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be. Why can't we wait here for a ride? Where are you going? Come on. You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did. Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on. The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back. No. I'm just not tired. Let's go. I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer. No. Get in. Hurry up. You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you. Put that back. Yes. Sing some more. That was beautiful. Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it. I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something? Do you have music up there? I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying? I don't know. Nobody knows. Yes. What are you doing? It's bad. Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home. The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us. A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with... Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend? The captain... Yes. You did? That's funny. So did we. Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.' You thought we were a different planet?! Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth? What happened? It's a kiss... Goodbye... Goodbye. Yes? Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... Goodbye. Well... I'm going to go now. Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay. No. Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on. Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it. Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and... Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen... Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride. You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike... You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this... Then don't be smart. You want this ticket? Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take... ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'... Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English. The driver will... Say it. That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.' I know that. But the buses don't go there. I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way. I'd love to have a baby. But I can't... No... The closest... Eh... yes... Yes. The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells... Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car. That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go. I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you. Then let me go. You don't need me. You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus... Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there? I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep... That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't... How many days and nights do you have to go... ...here? Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand? Sun... How will I do this one?... When do you have to be here? Why are you going here? What is here? You better. You didn't even see it. That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!! Music. Horses. What's the matter? This stuff could kill... Be my guest. You want to try it? A drink. Candy. Yes. Satisfied? Now get out. Out. Okay. In your pocket, please... Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket... Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat... Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!! No, no... don't say that. Bad word. Shit. No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott. My... husband. I know. Closed. Up there... I... eh... can't explain... But that's the only place you could be from. Are you from up there? Space? That's a big help. Where are you from? Who are you? I am Jenny Haydn. Not what. Who. What is for things. What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I? You'll see. It's closed... closed. We need one that's open. Yes. Very good. No gas... car dead. We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas. This car runs on gas. No gas. You're full of tricks, aren't you? What are you doing? Minneapolis. Yes. Smile. We're going to have to stop for gas soon. Money. X... Pancakes. Coupons. Flashlight. Which way? Good. Eh... police. Dashboard. Gear shift. Steering wheel. Steering wheel... Ah... no... What? Which way do you want to go? Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever... Don't... don't do this... please... He doesn't understand... just walk away... Help me!!! Call the police!! He's kidnapping me!!! Help me!! Don't worry. I'll be all right. Sure. It's easier not to tell if you don't know. Pull over. I've got to get back there. If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas? What? No, of course not. I don't know where he is. I told you I'm looking for someone. Slow down, slow down. You sure this is your car?I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times. Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car. I told you...I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me! Sure. I won't hold my breath. That's just what you would say. This is so unreal. I'm dreaming... You've got your six guns strapped on. You're ridding off on another adventure? Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real. I should go with you. Please... Believe in Penny Priddy? What? If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai? Go where? Where're you going? I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this. Oh, boy... Hanoi Shan--? The guy in your comic books. Boss of the World Crime League? Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death? The Pivot of Mystery himself? You're putting me on. He's a cartoon character. Yes, I do. Gimme a chance. I'm stronger than you think. How did she die? I wanna know. Looks like you're the one might go to pieces. Oh, my. She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you... I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova! I thought you liked me for myself. But why should you, huh? A jerk like me. Any time. What? I don't understand you. I don't understand anything anymore. Somewhere. See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby. I was adopted. I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me... Which? The one in my throat. No. Laramie. Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that? Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything. The Netherlands. Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming. It's kinda hard this way. The girl I remind you of. Was she pretty? You. Like the papers all say. Go away. Let me rot? What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that? Let me go, let me go, you creeps... My name's, Penny! But who cares? Do I look like that kinda girl? I lost my room this morning. I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going. What the hell else can I do? I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job. Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record. He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I... My name is Penny. Penny Priddy. There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you. I'm a nobody. Penny. I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age. This is so embarrassing... Better than him. What's his problem? Where's Buckaroo? Is he alive? What'd you do before? Can I ask? How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground? Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy. Flying to Cambodia. So where's Buckaroo?Meurice-- Sort of... No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead-- Something happened with Marty and Ray-- No, I-- I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in? Thanks, Meurice. You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens. Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem. ...So? ...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found-- You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened... ...But first I gotta know what happened. ...You leaving? ...Where is everything? ...What's going on with you two? Marty. I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny. I don't know what you're talking about. What the hell happened, Ray? Ray-- Well... what happened? What happened?--Was Meurice there? ...What do you mean? ...You called me this morning. Yeah... Why didn't you get into bed? ...What? ...Ray? Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray. ...You all right? Ray?... What time is it? Hello? Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm. When you don't they're usually nice. Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty. Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much. I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist? Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much. Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him. ...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some. I couldn't believe it either... Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me... I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal. I could've sworn I heard something. ...Well, I'd be okay in here-- Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed... Well... the couch would be all right... ...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair. You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here? I don't know, he didn't say anything. What? Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea. Where... where you going? ...Drive me to a motel? You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty... What was that? ...Ray?Christ, I'm getting bored. You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave? It'll pass. Going out with Meurice. About ten years. You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew. I don't follow baseball. Thanks. Remy.Yeah. Yeah. Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman? Sign. ...What was that back there? I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake... No. ...Hell. See, I never knew that. I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess? ...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think? Yeah... ...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him. ...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary. What? Tuesday. You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child? They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen. I will try to pass within. Then I will teach you our way of battle.... you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit. No, but many consider my training valuable. Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close... Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker? Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death. It's a maker... It could only be one thing.... It's a crysknife. That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham. I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin. I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages. Stop him yourself. Man-carved steps. What's happened?... Why did it leave? Yes... I can't... I can't. I'm ready. ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow... He knows. Is he....? A million deaths are not enough for Yueh... Where are we do you think? Excellent! Oh great mother! He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him. Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you. Your Reverence. Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you... Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.Yes, my Lord. I am your Truthsayer, my lord... He is here, my lord. Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him. Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions.... We felt his presence. You mustn't speak of... Stop him, Jessica! They tried and died. ... Many men have tried. What can be done has been done. I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice. They tried and died.... Jessica! Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug? The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot. Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true? Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation. NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it! You feel the flesh crisping? SILENCE... SILENCE. Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat. I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals. Pain.But what will happen? But the Power Source, Zaltar. How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city. But the phantom Zone is for criminals. But where?And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl! There's no need. I learned the Craft from my grandmother. She didn't take it from you, did she? Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you. Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener? Home? Whatever you say. Yes, of course, it was foolish of me. The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest. That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one. Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power. You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth. Eliminate her. A Storm Dragon? I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger? Have fun. Is he your entertainment for tonight? Sorry, mistress. And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy! But which one? Softball. The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near . What is it?Yes. Someone's chasing him. Oh, no thanks. Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy. He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation. I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is. Theories? Nice to meet you. I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers. He's nice. I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car. Lucy; come back! Why is he acting so strangely? It doesn't seem right. Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight. No thanks. You go on. It was just a trim. But what for? Must've been a defective puck. She did that deliberately. Thank you. You're very kind. My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth. I'd rather not talk about it. I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since... There isn't any. I can do that. Sure. Mate in five moves. Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers. I'd love to. No, MR. Danvers. I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it. I'm Linda Lee. Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.Well thanks a pile, fella. Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs. Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place. Remember me? We were in a disaster together. Hey! Ethan! You're supposed to guess. You bet your ass. Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention. I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us. I can't help it if men notice me. I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building. I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested! Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die? Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second? Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming. You're not gonna stay for the ice cream? Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead! Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop. Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D. Somebody's gotta do something!! I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed. Please, as a favour to me? So I won't be the only girl? Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you. Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away... You sure? Your hair looks the same. She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her. Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you. How'd you do that? She's a beast. Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time. You're not...an orphan are you? Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something? This is all your clothes? No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?What do you mean we? At last. Ultimate Power. That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools. I don't feel like it right now. Shut up, and get me a hacksaw. No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me. Yes. Whatever I say. From now on. I think I'd better keep it. Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard. What do I do? I don't know her name. I've been saving it. For the right moment. Am I? Still? That's easy for you to say, Bianca. Why did she have to show up now? No, a super girl. It's what we were warned about. He will be. In about five minutes. Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK? We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out. Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention. It must be the girls. One of the girls. Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game? What does it mean? The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it. I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall. There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs. It's a warning, that's for sure. I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski. What do you want? That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan. I'm ready for her. I'll show you. You can't put her out of your mind, is that it? You're a regular Einstein, aren't you? Guess! Go on. They want me. Doesn't it make you proud? Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry. You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week. Go on, talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten. I could force you. I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest! Come back to my house. My car's outside. This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you. Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want. You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am. Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first. Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl? It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl. This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion. And you think you're in love. What an adorable hat. To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together. A passionfruit smoothee. Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage. I bet they do. You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around. Come in, have a drink, we'll talk. Finished your estimate? Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch. I've got things to do. George---I thought you'd never ask. Why George, are you proposing? Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants. Nonsense. Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel? Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice? We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft. Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself. I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night. I could teach you a thing or two now. You're wasting your breath. Nigel, get lost. Throw him out. You Scorpios can never take a joke. I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber. Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head. Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far. I just did. Because I have the Power. I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places. Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world. Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel. Where is inner space? Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go. What's it like? Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time. I'm free. I can never thank you enough. Not yet. The Danvers. And two of your little friends. A cheap trick. I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry. That was meant for me!Do you want to come to Argo City? I'll come back as soon as I can. How do I fight it? You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over. And you can see how you feel about me, right? What? You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source. I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park. That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live? There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil... Aren't you forgetting about Selena? Are you asking me for a "date"? Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever. I don't see why not. And now? Miss what? It seemed that way to me. Hello. Are you still mad at me? But I don't understand. I sort of like what you said. But why? Just like that? What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you? Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours. But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her. I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places. Is this how? Well...I guess one is all right. Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand. No. What's that? Of Course I don't hate you. I don't hate anyone. All this talk about love, it's silly. We're from different worlds. We can't do that. But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you. Tell me where I can find her. Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you. It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me. No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space. Yes. It reminds me of home. Are you sure it's all right for us to be here? We have to have a long talk about all this. You love me? Who didn't? Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye. I have to. Later. I'm taking you to the hospital. It's for your own protection. That's home. They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead. It's everywhere. But water is always the door. It's the most beautiful place in the universe. Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused. You could come too. It might be safer for you. For what? You've run out of things to throw, Selena. It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for. Cheap but effective. That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while. I don't scare that easily. Who are you ? Thank you. I'm going to close this up again. Zaltar! Zaltar. Use the wand! It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work. Don't stop. Keep moving. Better than when I was a child. I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart. You're going to take me back? Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die. You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers. Then come with me. Then teach me how. Why? I knew it! If there's a way in, there must be a way out. Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me. Zaltar, please help me. That horrible woman! You look at them? How? But what about other people? Don't you miss them? Are you happy, Zaltar? It's lovely. . . Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City... ...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..." Others? I know. ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone. Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source... I was on Earth... What is this place?We will, kiddo. That bum. So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes. Not lately. Did you check messages? Don't wear the beige one. Alright, the beige one. Great. Great. That guy's a jerk. I did you a favor.I won't let the fat kid down. It's not brain surgery, Chuck. Alright! Thanks, Chuck. I need the money. Can I still work the hours around my classes? I don't know. I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life. Aren't I worth waiting for? Mission control to Chuck, come in... Yes, Chuck? I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'. You and Matt have a good time. I thought you did. I hate the beige one. You're a big help. What do you think? I'll do the same for you sometime. I had him hooked. He was just about to ask me out. I could tell. What's it to ya? Aha! Is she young? You must have a girlfriend. I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller. What are you doing? We did it, Kyle. We got it. You're not supposed to. You'll beg for mercy in a second. I bet you're ticklish. Kyle... Oh, Kyle. And so you feel nothing. So much pain. A girl. You know. That's not what I meant. Was there someone special? Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like? It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh? You must be pretty disappointed. Don't say that. He'll find us, won't he? I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now. Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us. I want it to be over for you. I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done. You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you. I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs... You must have had a fun child- What's that? I'm dying for a shower. You could use one too. And we'd better check that bandage. Yes. And I don't want to know where you got it. Kyle? Fuck you! Let go of me! Listen. Understand. I'm not a military objective, Reese. I'm a person... You don't own me. Reese. Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again. We have to so it ourselves. Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard. Eighty-six it. We'll blow up the place...burn it down. Something. Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government. Right? Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing... Look. I found it. Isn't that it? Cyber Dynamics Corporation? That's where we're going. Thanks a lot. Let's get cleaned up, Kyle. About where you're from. Okay. Talk some more. You like it? It's my first. Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it. And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare? Come on, me? The mother of the future? Am I tough? Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook. I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats. You volunteered? Stop! I don't want to know. Hold still. So...it was John that ordered you here? Well, at least I know what to name him. I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him. What's he like? Just talk. Tell me about my son. Is he tall? This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something. Forget it? Are you crazy? Let me see it. We gotta get you to a doctor. Caught one? You mean you got shot? Kyle, what's it like when you go through time? Reese...you got a first name? Freezing. The what? I don't understand... Tell me. Just start at the beginning. Just let me go. And you're from the future too? So, it's from the future, is that right? Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet. Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but... This is a mistake. I haven't done anything. Yes. Don't hurt me. Okay. I can't sleep. I guess so. You're a doctor? Lieutenant, are you sure it's them? Maybe I should see the ...bodies. Yes, but I don't want to leave. I think this guy's following me. ...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
