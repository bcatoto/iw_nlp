Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule. Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown. Listen, Bud, the boys downtown are under heavy fire from the boys in Washington. That's why they're putting pressure on the boys on the board. You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board. What? Simon. And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman. But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe. We've got a condition red with our marriage.  I think you're in love with that shuttle, not with me.  I want a divorce, Sarg. Sarg, there's been someone else for fifteen years.  You were just too involved in your work to see it. You just can't see it, can you, Sarg. It was just a joke, Jimmy. What are we going to do?! Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays. Yes. Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in. He was never appreciated at the Institute. Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury. Should I fake my orgasms? I'm so excited, Simon. No, I've been excited before. Te...! Ted, we've been worried sick ever since you escaped from the Ronald Reagan Institute For The Mentally Feeble. But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out. What did Ted mean? Shuttle test pilot goes mad! Ted, what's wrong? Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground. Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti. No!  Wait!  You're hurting him! Simon, why has he become so... so... Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help? You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington. Yes.  He's dying a-n-d wants to be buried on Mercury. You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand. Don't be too long. Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself. Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man. Ted, you should go right back to the hospital. That's $38. Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better. Who's that, Ted? And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now. What's his problem? Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon. I just can't go on living with a man who refuses to deal with reality, Ted.  I have to go now.  Believe me, it's best for all concerned. If that's the way you want it. Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you. I'm worried about her, Frank.  She could do something senseless, something violent. Young man, would you have change for a twenty? Thank you anyway, but I wanted it in quarters. That just doesn't make any sense. I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down... I'll trust you on this, Bud, but I'm a little nervous about Oveur's record. Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there. Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency. Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country. What...? All right.  Goodbye, Babe. Joey!  Remember, sexual impotence is nothing to be ashamed of! Ya, Sven. That's odd. Welcome aboard.  Isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist? Yes -- he's dying and wants to be buried in the new l-a-n-d. Welcome aboard.  Can I take your case? Doesn't he realize that a weak proletariat needs a strong liberal bourgeoisie in a joint struggle against monopoly capitalism? Can I hang that for you, sir? Ted!  What are you...? Ted, we're taking off! Please take your seats. Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor. What can I do, Doctor Rumack? I mean for Ted. Is that a good sign, Doctor? Hello, Ted. I brought you some spaghetti. What are you doing, Ted? Ted. Ted! Is he making any progress, Doctor? Yes, sir. That's really strange. Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze. That doesn't make sense. Repeat analysis. That's not possible. I guess this is pretty exciting for you. Yes, it is.  How long will the trip take? Our actual flight time is over fourteen months, but due to the time-space variant at sub-light speeds, our onboard flight time will be just over eighteen hours. Gee, Mom, how does that work? How many times do I have to tell you, I'm not your mother!  I've never seen you before! Why did she yell at me like that? I don't know what it is. Would you like something to read? TIME, NEWSWEEK, BUSINESS WEEK, and the The twenty-four volume dissertation on the Hebrew law. And you, sir? I think so. That's okay, ROK. Go ahead. Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit. Would you like a little breakfast, Captain Oveur?  Over. How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over. Poached and over, Captain Oveur?  Over. I don't think we do poached eggs on toast over, Captain Oveur.  Over. All right, Captain Oveur.  Over. You should really put that case in the compartment above your head, sir. I can help you if you can't get it up. You're going to love it, Jimmy. Not John's irregularity again. Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove. We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over. Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital. I've never used the word insane, Ted. The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick. I'd use the word insane. Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone. You've been hurt. No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse. Do you want to talk about it. No.  I mean your relationship. Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change. Not if the people change together in relation to that love. Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love. No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying. Mind if Jimmy here takes a look around, Captain? Holy shit. Ted, I want you to relax.  Let your mind go back, back past your youth, past your childhood to your mother's womb. Try to remember your birth.  Was it difficult? Ted, are you okay?  Here, take one of these stress pills. Request; comprehensive electrical systems check. Request; life support systems check. Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes. Yes I did... Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question? Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know. I don't think we have any alternative, Captain. We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system. You can do it from up here, Captain. No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit. Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it. It's for Mr. McCrosky. Do you think we should bother him?  He's been acting a bit odd lately. He's fine.  He just thinks he's Lloyd Bridges. The phone's for you, Mr. McCrosky. Here, let me help you.  I think it's the space centre.  Now, let's not get too excited. Simon! Captain Oveur! Simon, what's happening?! Can't we change course? Then Ted was right! Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved? I've got to get Ted.  Just don't come apart on me now, Simon. No. Please, ladies and gentlemen, please calm down.  Listen to me! We've been thrown off course just a tad. In space terms, about 70 million miles. The bumps you feel are car-sized asteroids smashing into the hull. Also, we're heading right for the sun and can't seem to change course. Not exactly.  We're also out of coffee. But Father, I'm not Catholic. I knew all about it.  I was unfaithful once, too. Remember Harriet, your first receptionist? There is absolutely nothing to worry about! Your crew is in complete control of the situation. Ted, Ted.  Listen to me, Ted.  You were right all along.  Ted, we've lost the crew and Simon's turned to jelly! My God. He's finally come to terms with his own psychosis. But he was right!  He's not crazy! Miss, I'm a nurse with a dying F-A-T-H-E- R, I know what I'm talking about.  Now I'm going to need fresh sheets, gauze, Q-tips, and all the vaseline you have on board! Now! I'll need all the boiling water you can get your hands on! Yes. The washroom's down there on your right. And not too much! Keep an eye on that side of the ship. I'll need all your boiling water. Thank you.  That makes me feel so much better. I don't know who you are or how you lost your sight, but I'll never forget this night as long as I live. I'm afraid that leg's going to have to come off. Wait.  This isn't your chart.  You just had a touch of air sickness. You'll be fine. I'm terrified. And I'm a nurse.  Everything will be okay. Pass it on. Simon, I... Hello.  This is the Mayflower.  Over! Come in, anyone. This is Elaine Thompson.  I'm five-six, 123 pounds with brown hair and I'm sitting down and facing the front. Ted! Ted, there's no time to explain. Ted, I was wrong about you. How could I ever have doubted you? I love you, Ted. Ted, this reminds me of twenty years ago over Chicago. The boys downtown are taking the heat from the boys in Washington and the boys... Bud, the President wants an explanation. I was reading too. Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor... General Walker is here, Billy.  He wants to talk to you. Ted, please be careful. If this country was run by vegetarian women who's old men deserted them after knocking them up instead of by meat-eating males, this thing never would have happened. Commissioner, Aquarius. This insurance policy. An electric tooth. Joey was supposed to go to Des Moines for an operation to cure his impotence. Then you know it. Well, I found out Joey got on this shuttle instead and... That's what worries me. He's suicidal. Ted, we've only got ten minutes. I mean until we start to burn up. That was very well put, Ted. He's got a point, Ted. I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will. A b... Sixteen 'C', why? A b... What should I say? Would everyone not carrying a bomb please move to the lounge. Come in, Control!  We have the bomb!! But it is a dry heat, Ted. The b... Ted... I love you.  Be careful. Now I want everyone to move to the front of the cabin. That's fine.  Stay calm.  We just want everyone as far away from the blast as possible. Simon!  Wait!  What are you doing?! Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there. Simon, what are you saying?! Simon, no! Give me the President of the United States.  Tell him it's the Commissioner. I don't know how the old man's going to take this. I don't think that shuttle's going to make it, sir. Yes, sir. Simon just ejected! You mean... What will happen to him, Ted? Not when I'm with you, Ted. Are these my hands? I'm a nurse.  I can't afford to be afraid, Father. Heads between the knees! Between your own knees, Father! Set! Compute! Ted, the lever! Will this work, Ted? Ted, that's Alpha Beta! Ted!  We're not stopping!! Ted! Seat backs up.  Thank you. Sir, you really must take your seat. Ted, what's going to happen to us?
