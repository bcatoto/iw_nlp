Have you ever made love in a hammock? Your bed. You go ahead... What are they saying? I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't. It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs. Sort of. Could we move a little faster? When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late. My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me. I was so upset... I told them I slept with you. My mothers slapped me. That was the first time she'd ever hit me. I couldn't believe it. I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying. They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that. I decided to hide out all night. They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me. The woods were cold and damp from the rain. I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep. All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps. I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark. I couldn't see anything. I heard a cracking noise behind me. I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man. So grotesque he was almost inhuman. He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again. I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away. I ran and ran, but he kept coming. He was big but so fast. He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me? Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground. I was kicking and yelling. He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods. Oh, please... please... You promised you'd never ask me. I'm trying. I'm really trying. I'm here with you. Can't that be enough for now? ... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am. The quiet can fool you. It fooled me. You can never be sure of what's out there. It's deceiving. Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset. It'll mellow you out. No. I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs. Are you all right, Shelly? I'm serious. Doesn't this look a little strange to you? Somebody was in here. Did you stay here last night? Nothing. This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it? Just slow down. Let me get to know you again. Let me get to know this place again. I don't know. You haven't changed a bit. Always so sure of yourself. Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you. You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters. You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that. Derek... stop.Sure. What? Barely. I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime. I vote for the hammock. That was the best yet. Was it you... me... or the hammock? Think you can figure it out? First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you... How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around? You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house. Not now. I'm cold. What're you doing? We'd be all alone. We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see. Why don't we go take a swim? What was that? No way. We're pregnant. Remember? Cool it, Andy. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. A hammock? What's this? Come on down! I don't know. I flunked Spanish. Okay, we won't. We'll just have fun, all agreed? Which one is it?You're wrong. I never said you were "nothing". I do like you. But not when you act like a jerk. You don't "have to." Why do you do these stupid things?! Damn you, Shelly! Don't say any more. We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault. We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang... ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways. This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country. Bullseye! You're the boss. What're you doing? This is no time to celebrate! Got any good ideas? Keep looking. Stop worrying. I don't think they'll bother to come after us. See anything? Yes. May be please have the wallet. Everything's gonna be fine. Come on, Shelly. Who else is gonna give him a lift? Why don't you help us? Destroy the evidence, Pronto! In that little thing? What d'ya got in there? You're Shelly?
