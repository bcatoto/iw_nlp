It's locked.  ...we, we love her, Dick and me...  But what can we do? She don't know  who's visiting her...  ...You saw her?  You know how beautiful she was? Her husband left her, and he took  her kids... They, they, they'd let  you die in there. They don't care.  Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the  Chronic Care... in Arlington...?  They'd take her in. Perpetual care.  They'd take her. Fifty thousand  dollars they want. An endowment.  I don't want to leave her. Dick...  the, the... and Father Laughlin, he  said that it was God's will...  My doctor told me that I got to move  out West... that's when we filed in  court. We didn't want to sue...  ...But Dick, he's looking for two  years in Tucson... and they called  him up and said to come out. He's a  good man. He's only trying to do  what's right.  This is my husband.  He saw her at the Northern Care...  We just can't do it anymore. This is our chance to get away.  Thank you very much.  Mickey told me to come back to work.  ...here's your mail, call Mrs.  Doneghy...  ...that was a Dr. David Gruber's  office...  Mickey told him to call. 'He's some very hotshot surgeon at  Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet  with you at seven tonight re testimony  in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You  meet him at the hospital.'  It looks that way.  ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told  you that.  Frank Galvin's... who's calling  please? Bishop Brophy's office...  I'm sorry, he's not in... may I take  a mess... tomorrow when, two  o'clock... I'll check my book...  Yes. Mr. Galvin's clear at that  time... the Bishop's office, tomorrow,  the fifth at two p.m. Thank you...  What does it mean?  Does that mean I'm back for awhile?  I'd like an apartment.  No. Thank you.  I'm glad you did. Thank you. Good  night.  Jimmy, I said, don't you go in your  pocket if there's nothing there...  ...and what did he say...?  ...Sir, you aren't allowed to be in  here...  You can't be in here.  Still looking.  I changed my room at the Hotel.  The TV didn't work.  And what are you? A cop?  My ex-husband was a lawyer.  Yes. It was, actually.  Who says I'm the one that called it  off?  Laura.  What if it wasn't you that I came  back to see?  I think I will.  And are they going to get it?  Maybe what?  And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...?  That's all right.  How'm I doing so far?  What are you drinking? Jimmy...?  Dr. Gruber's not here today, Sir.  Yes, Sir. He hasn't been in all day...  He's not on the chart...  Should I?  Yes.  The Big Boy did...?  Huh.  Me, too.  Would you like me to leave...? Is this a bad time -- ?  Is this a bad time.  What happened...?  ...and is that serious?  Do you want me to go...?  Why don't you get some rest?  You can't work if you can't think.  You get in bed. It's all right. I'll  stay here with you. It's all right.  Come on...  Yes.  I told the guy I didn't want to talk  to...  No.  ...you got your doctor's testimony.  Why do you need me?  I've got nothing to say to you.  Nothing happened.  And ask me what?  I didn't do it, Mister.  Who says that I'm protecting anyone?  I don't owe them a goddamn thing.  You know, you're pushy, fella...  Well, maybe you better do that, then. You know you guys are all the same.  You don't care who gets hurt. You're  a bunch of whores. You'd do anything  for a dollar. You got no loyalty...  no nothing... you're a bunch of  whores.  Isn't there something you...  You're talking like a drunk.  And it's over...?  Well, then what are you doing here?  You do what you want. You want to  leave... You want to go kill yourself?  You want me to tell you it's your  fault? It probably is. What are you  going to do about it? I thought it's not over till the  jury comes in.  You told me so. Maybe you'd get some  sympathy. You came to the wrong place.  Maybe I'll tell you later.  Not if you don't grow up...  You're like a kid, you're coming in  here like it's Saturday night, you  want me to say that you've got a  fever -- you don't have to go to  school...  Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You  say you're going to lose. Is it my  fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't  start until tomorrow and already  it's over for you!  What is your wife's picture doing by  the side of your...  What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.  Joe... Joe...  You're pressuring yourself...  Yes. We've all got to let go.  What does it mean? I... I mean we, you have other  tactics...  Are we going to win? We have, you know, other tactics,  though...  Is it over?  What are you going to do?  I have to talk to you.  Hello.  Hello? Mr. Gal... where are you...?  You're going to New York? I... you're  kidding... Because I'm going to New  York. I just got a call. I have to go sign  papers. About my divorce. I... good.  Frank. We'll meet there. All right?  Can we meet there, Joe?  At the Beacon. On Fifty-third  Street... we can spend the night.  At around four...?  I feel the same way, Joe... I'll see  you this afternoon?  Hi.  You live in the neighborhood?  How old is he?  Thank you.  Who told you that?  Mrs. Simmonds.  I used to be a nurse.  Yes.  It's all right... it's all right...  it's all right... it's all right...  The Knicks are pressing hard...  Katherine Lynn Price.  I do.  Yes...  Yes.  Yes.  Kathy Costello. That's my maiden  name.  Yes.  She said she had a full meal one  hour before coming to the hospital.  Yes.  I did.  Yes.  It's a crime.  I wouldn't do it.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I...  I... yes.  I...  They lied.  I do. Yes.  That's not my handwriting.  Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But  I, I didn't write that figure.  Because I kept a copy. I have it  right here.  I thought I would need it.  After, after the operation, when  that poor girl, she went in a coma.  Dr. Towler called me in. He told me  he had five difficult deliveries in  a row and he was tired, and he never  looked at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a  nine. Or else, or else, he said... He said he'd fire me. He said I'd  never work again... Who were these  men...? Who were these men...? I  wanted to be a nurse...
