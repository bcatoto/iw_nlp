Does that mean I'm back for awhile? What does it mean? Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office... ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that. It looks that way. Mickey told him to call. 'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.' ...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office... ...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy... Mickey told me to come back to work.After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine. Or else, or else, he said... He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse... I thought I would need it. Because I kept a copy. I have it right here. Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure. That's not my handwriting. I do. Yes. They lied. I... I... yes. I... Yes. Yes. Yes. No. I wouldn't do it. It's a crime. Yes. I did. Yes. She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital. Yes. Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name. Yes. Yes. Yes... I used to be a nurse. Mrs. Simmonds. Who told you that? Thank you. How old is he? You live in the neighborhood? Hi.I have to talk to you. What are you going to do? Is it over? Yes. We've all got to let go. You're pressuring yourself... Joe... Joe... What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure. What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your... Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you! You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school... Not if you don't grow up... Maybe I'll tell you later. You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place. You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it? I thought it's not over till the jury comes in. You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself? Well, then what are you doing here? And it's over...? You're talking like a drunk. Isn't there something you... Yes. You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on... Why don't you get some rest? Do you want me to go...? ...and is that serious? What happened...? Is this a bad time. Would you like me to leave...? Is this a bad time -- ? And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...? Maybe what? And are they going to get it? I think I will. What if it wasn't you that I came back to see? Laura. Who says I'm the one that called it off? Yes. It was, actually. My ex-husband was a lawyer. And what are you? A cop? The TV didn't work. I changed my room at the Hotel. Still looking. Me, too. Huh. The Big Boy did...? Yes. Should I? How'm I doing so far?Well, maybe you better do that, then. You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores. You know, you're pushy, fella... I don't owe them a goddamn thing. Who says that I'm protecting anyone? I didn't do it, Mister. And ask me what? Nothing happened. I've got nothing to say to you. ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me? No. I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...Are we going to win? We have, you know, other tactics, though... What does it mean? I... I mean we, you have other tactics... We just can't do it anymore. This is our chance to get away. He saw her at the Northern Care... ...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right. My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue... I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will... You know how beautiful she was? Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment. ...You saw her? But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her... ...we, we love her, Dick and me... It's locked.
