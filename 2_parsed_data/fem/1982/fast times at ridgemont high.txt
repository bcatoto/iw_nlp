Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda. And they don't call my parents? I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something. Are you Linda Barrett?And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either. Not if you're over sixteen. All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's. Yes. There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them. I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it. Well I might go to Dartmouth. Yeah, like maybe never. He says he's got to stay in Chicago. He says I should visit him sometimes. He's not coming. Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV. What do you want? Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open. Stacy, he's not a guy. He's a little prick! There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this. That little prick. That little prick. You're right. I didn't tell you that. What? But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too. Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here! It couldn't be. What do you think it is? You have been acting very strange the last few weeks. God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban. Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips? God, he hardly even talks anymore. No. I think they're both virgins. He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him. I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes. No. But it's a nice idea. Climax together. You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck. Okay, penis, that's one, balls... Why don't you put your mother's secret book back? I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here. Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen? Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday. Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on. I guess Ron hasn't called yet. You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy. Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games. Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him. Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again. Hey! That's my line! So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious? You'll always remember your first time. Was it great? Just kidding. About 10cc. There's nothing to it. What's the big deal? What variables? What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't. Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them. I know. God. People exaggerate so much at this school. I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning. Believe it. If I didn't have a fiancï¿½ in Chicago, I'd go for it. Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will. Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies. I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him. Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call. Should we buy a frame for that? Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot. Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man. Don't you like him? How's it going.Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing. If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back. I don't want to talk about it here, Brad. Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool. How much did they cost? Were those flowers really for me, Brad?No. Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad... Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it. Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do. It's just Linda. And Mark from school. Maybe yes. Maybe no. But your face did! You are a virgin! I don't know. I was just curious. Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin? Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa. I'm just guessing. Why? Because she won't sleep with you? You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you? Is everything okay at work? It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him. Thanks for getting rid of those flowers. I'll explain everything later. Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work? Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this? Don't strain yourself. Your friends use the pool too. Why can't you do it? U.S. History. Mr. Hand. Hi, Brad. Get going. Mike! You have a mess on C-9! Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic. It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic. We've got to get an abortion? Take that back. I know it's yours. Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant. Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it. I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you. I didn't see you this morning. I guess I did. What's wrong? I think we're making a lot of noise. Hey, Mike? I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not. How about both of us at the same time? Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike? So are you. Are you shaking? He's my friend, too. Are you really a virgin? Pick a suit. Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change! Do you want to take a quick swim? Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out? I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one? Sure. Come on in. Mark is a really nice boy... Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself. I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag. O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay? Oh, really? Nice to meet you. Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss. I can't believe it! But what about Doug? Dartmouth?! But what are you going to do? Sometime? Not coming? What happened? Where's Doug? I want romance. You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex. Another summer of working at Swenson's. Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy. I paid for it and everything. Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father. I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited... You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old. You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys. I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him. It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone. What do you think it is? I don't know... I just don't feel right. I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing. God, I don't think so. Better look in the house. I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms. I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda? What do you think? What's Doug do in Chicago? How long does Doug take? Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.' Does that ever happen? All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?' Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category? Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?' You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school. Sixteen. What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner. Thanks a lot. I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out. Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen? Not since November. I think Christmas brings out the worst in people. If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen. Does Doug care that you're seventeen? There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen. Come on, Linda. It's just sex. It was nice. It was okay. Oh! That's where that group got its name from. Well I never did it. Like, you know, giving blow jobs. No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at. Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed. Do you think guys find that attractive? Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar. No way! He just called him a dick. I can't believe I start high school tomorrow. He was hot, wasn't he? Really? I can't do that. So what did you do? Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week? He gave me his card. 'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.' What should I do? Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really. Do you think that guy's cute? Yes. What about those other guys you live with? Yes... I am really nineteen. It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last? That's a nice shirt. The point sounds fine. I don't know. Wherever you want. Thanks. So do you. Thanks for picking me up. What can I get for you tonight. I know, everyone says that. I'd like that. Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer. I know everybody says it, but I really mean it. I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year. Hi, Mark. What about the notes? I made a fool of myself. Oh. I see. John Bonham? What's April 16th? Where's Mike today? Do you really have to go? This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan? Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right? Thanks. So... What do you want to do? Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind. I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink? No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house. Do you want to come inside? Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck. Sure. I'll... have another Coke. Not at all. Are you all right? I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special. I've heard that, too. Yeah. She is pretty good. Do you have Mrs. George for English? This is a nice car. Thanks for coming to get me. Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink. What's your other question? We keep them, in case the people come back. We keep them.
