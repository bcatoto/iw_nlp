This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials. But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control -- Will you please be quiet ! Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order? I still don't under -- En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened? Has something happened ? Do you read us? Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead. Is that a poem? The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I? How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father. David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy. Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely. Jim please -- ... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority... ... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...? ... taking Genesis away from us... ... Can't read you... repeat... Jim... read me? Can you read me? David. Please. This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food. I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan? You do that and you'll have murdered your father. Jim -- David -- Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event. Will you please be quiet! We must have order here. This has to be some sort of mistake. I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one. Maybe... Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring -- I know, I know... And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...What are you looking at? Oh, I believe it. The Admiral's son. Only half of you would get there. Aye, sir -- Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well. Admiral on the bridge! Understood, sir. Aye, sir. Three minutes, thirty seconds. Two minutes, ten seconds. Aye, sir. Power levels quite low, sir. All stop, sir. At what. That was close -- '... no uncoded messages on an open channel...' But the damage report -- we were immobilized... Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death... WHAT ? How? On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know. The Kobayashi Maru , sir. Admiral? Stage Two of what? It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless. That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied. Indeterminate life signs. Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.' On screen... Reliant's command... Who? Energize defense fields. Yes. Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical... May I ask how you dealt with the test? I failed to resolve the situation. I did not think so. I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating. May I speak, sir? It is still regulation, Admiral. As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me. ... No, sir. It has not. Because... there was no way to win. I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities. Permission to speak candidly, sir? Any suggestions, Admiral? We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space. Prepare for warp speed. Course heading, Captain? Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu. We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here. Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission... I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister. Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone. You lied. By the book... Aye, sir. Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est -- Aye, sir. Never, sir. All moorings are clear, Captain. Aye, sir. He's very human. He's not what I expected, Sir. Fire all phasers...!Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond! Nothing, sir. I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please -- ... No response, sir. Admiral -- Mr. Scott on discrete. I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system. Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant. She's not responding... I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
