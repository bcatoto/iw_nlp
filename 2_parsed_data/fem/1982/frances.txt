No one ever came up to me and said,  'You're a fool. There isn't such a  thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing  you.' It wasn't a murder. I think God just  died of old age. And when I realized  He wasn't any more, it didn't shock  me. It seemed natural and right. And yet I began to wonder what the  minister meant when he said, 'God,  the Father, sees even the smallest  sparrow fall. He watches over all  his children.' That jumbled it all  up for me. But still sometimes I found that God  was useful to remember, especially  when I lost things that were  important. 'Please God, let me find  my red hat with the blue trimmings.' It usually worked. God became a  superfather that couldn't spank me.  But if I wanted a thing badly enough,  He arranged it. But if God loved all of His children  equally, why did He bother about my  red hat and let other people lose  their fathers and mothers for always? See you next weekend, Dad. I began to see that He didn't have  much to do about hats or people dying  or anything. They happened whether  He wanted them to or not, and He  stayed in Heaven and pretended not  to notice. I wondered a little why God was such  a useless thing. It seemed a waste  of time to have Him. After that He  became less and less, until He was...  nothingness. I felt rather proud that I had found  the truth myself, without help from  anyone. It puzzled me that other  people hadn't found out, too. God  was gone. We had reached past Him.  Why couldn't they see it? It still  puzzles me. You're going straight to hell, Frances  Farmer! Seattle is in the news again as a  high school junior wins a national  competition and a hundred dollar  prize with an essay denying God. This prompts civic officials to charge  that left-wing politicians are  encouraging atheism in the city's  schools. Miss Frances Farmer was  unavailable for comment, but her  mother Lillian -- Farmer, a well-known local dietician,  stepped to her daughter's defense. Frances has not turned her back on  the Lord, they're just having a  momentary difference of opinion.  What child hasn't questioned the  Lord's mysteries in order to better  understand them? To paraphrase Mr.  Voltaire, I may not agree with what  she says, but I'll defend to the  death her right to say it. Freedom  of speech, unlike in the dark  countries to the east, still lives  in America! And in my home. Hi Emma. Bye Emma. Don't touch me. Okay then... I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain  in the butt! You newshounds've been  after me and my folks ever since I  won that dumb contest. I'm just  sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares  what I think? Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in  the papers -- nobody'd even know  about it. No... Actually, you look more like a  cop. I'll... take your word for it. So  who are you, then? Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel! You know, my Dad's done some work  for Kaminski... Whattaya mean? But I'm not. The newspapers're -- Yeah. Could look bad for you and  Kaminski too, I guess. Well aren't you the smoothie. Now  you're going to ask for my number, I  suppose. Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York. Harry. I know. I can thank you for that. It was a  hard-earned talent. Bread? When's the last time you saw a hundred  dollars, Ernest Farmer? Mama... I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy  yourselves. After all, this is a  celebration. Thanks, Dad. I didn't have much to do with it. Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry  York? He talked to me today. Told me to  keep my mouth shut or I'd get  everybody in trouble. Is Kaminski a Communist? He's a socialist, then? It's already started, Dad... with  me. And I can't understand how it can  hurt to be honest, but the more I  tried to explain -- Don't listen to him, little sister.  When you're proud of what you are,  you don't refuse the label,  understand? Yes, Ma. And you... should be proud. You won  that contest and made a name for  yourself. You're poisoning that child's mind. You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice  law for decent folk instead of  Communists and indigents -- How? What do they do for you, Kaminski  and his friends? They're all  anarchists! Traitors! That's right. I can't understand a  man who puts strangers over his  family, a man who gives up a good  career to become a shiftless inkhorn  failure. Good. As usual. Everything as usual, Mr.  Farmer. Just give me my due. Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown  myself in Puget Sound. I'm fine, perfectly fine. Dad, please, don't leave early. Just  because of Mama -- What can we do, we must live! We  shall live, Uncle Vanya... And then we shall rest, we shall  rest. We shall hear the angels, we  shall see the whole sky all diamonds,  we shall see how all earthly evil,  all our sufferings, are drowned in  the mercy that will fill the whole  world. And our life will grow  peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress... Poor, dear Uncle Vanya, you are  crying... In your life you haven't known what  joy was; but wait, Uncle Vanya,  wait... We shall rest... We shall rest! I could really learn to hate her. Stand in line. But I'll never win that. Really? Thank you. Hi, Harry. Did you see the play? Well? What'd you think? How'd I look? Don't be a rat, Harry. You really think so? I don't know... I did... feel  different... Alive. Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll  kill me. She hates Russians. I do  want to go, though... to New York,  especially... but I wanted to do  it... Quietly. What happened to him? ...So you think I should go. I don't know, Harry. I... I want so  many... Yeah. Not in the long run, anyway. What? Come on, Harry. This is America,  land of the free. I thought we might go skinny dipping. For starters. Communists?! No daughter of mine is  going to Communist Russia! You act like I'm a bomb-thrower,  Mama. It's just a trip. But they're using you! Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's  just a chance to travel, see things.  Besides, it's the only way I can get  to New York. I'll pay your way to New York. I'll  work, I'll slave. I'll sell my  vegetables to the truck farmers, or -- Oh, Mama, don't you understand? I have to do this on my own. You  see, I've learned your lesson very  well. To do what I think is right  and everyone else be damned. I never taught you that! Little sister, if you don't wise up  soon, it's going to be out of my  hands! It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's  my life. Yes, but important people are  concerned about this. Judge Hillier  spoke to Alma Styles -- I don't care. ...You will. What do I do, Dad? Of course. If I didn't, I wouldn't put you  through it. The authorities tell me there's no  legal way I can stop her, but the  way I see it, it's bigger than me or  my family... American integrity, that's what's at  stake here. They're sending my  daughter to the heartland of darkness.  . .the dark forces that would  overthrow our country. Your country.  My country. I'm not a Communist. I said all countries are of cultural  interest. Besides, Russia has the  greatest theatre company in the world. Not much. Ask me about Stanislavski. Help me save my daughter! Save the  children of America. I love you, Mama. I love you, Dad. Frances, I'm warning you. I'm gonna  throw myself beneath the wheels.  I'll do it, Frances. Frances! Oh, I swim some... play the piano  badly... and I read like a fiend: I  like history. Look, I... That's me. Good morning, Mr. Bebe! Who's this? Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option. Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them  off a little more? I guess so, sir. Very fine bone structure. Heavens no. Go on. 'Brief fling?' Did you get the check?... Oh my God,  it opened?!, what'd you think? Well, I hope I get bigger parts,  they don't come much smaller. No, I'm fine. I just have water in  my mouth. No, Mama, I'm not changing my name.  They can't actually make you, you  know? Most people don't realize that. Oh Dick... No, no, nothing's going on. I love you too, Mama. Give my love  to Dad. Bye! Okay, handsome. You win. Kurt! But, Kurt, I... Oh, Kurt! I'm sorry... I'm sorry, let's go back. Harry! Harry-god-damn-York! A real  person! Me? Look at you! What're you doing  in Hollywood? Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's  the real reason? Yeah, I read about that. Terrible  business, suicide. What? Oh no... Jesus. But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they  do it? You jackass! C'mon, let's get out of here. Not bad. It was slow at first, but  I'm doing bits now. I know what ability you're interested  in. Harry... I met someone. Yeah. These creases... I look like I just  came from the laundry! I'm supposed  to be hiding out in boxcars, sleeping  on floors. Oh, I know that. But it could look  more realistic, don't you think? I'll notice. Come along with me, Fanny. That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook. You see: We've got to change that  name. I like your looks. You have the  classical bone structure of the very  great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich -- Thank you -- I intend to make a great deal of  money off you. Since we have you on a seven year  contract, I'm planning long-range.  I'm going to loan you out to Sam  Goldwyn to make a picture called  "Come and Get It." Really? That's a very good book.  It'd make a terrific -- Never mind that. I'm concerned about  you. Your attitude. Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer,  and people have to buckle down, do  their jobs. You see, I view myself  as the Henry Ford of motion picture  industry, and I can't have the fellow  who puts on the wheels arguing with  the man who installs head-lights,  now can I? But I'm concerned with everything,  Mr. Bebe. No, I'm concerned with everything. But I'm the one up there on the  screen. That's right. You're an actress,  Miss Farmer and your job is to act. I guess it's no secret that I'm proud.  Only twenty-one years old, and look  at all she's done. As for her looks, I flatter myself  that she gets them from me. And not only has Frances come home a  star; she's also brought me this big  handsome lug of a son-in-law! Oh, Dwayne! This is like a fairy tale! What'd he say? There she is! A little strange. It's okay. Smile, little sister, smile. Well, the truth is the city had  nothing to do with it. I was lucky.  And what wasn't luck was hard work. Miss Farmer, I can't tell you how  proud I am to meet you. On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club,  as a token of our vast admiration -- Excuse me. Yes...? Don't I know you? I don't believe so. Sure. You shouted at me in the  auditorium when I read my essay. No, my dear. You must be mistaken. Oh bullshit. Listen, I'm still the same girl that  wrote that essay, the same girl who  went to Russia, and you people aren't  proud to meet me at all. Well, the studio told me not to. Who ever thought they'd be right for  once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo  back there -- Dick... and my mother! She acts like  she's on Mars or something -- Forget it. You know, the funny thing is: it's  not a great movie. I mean it could've  been, but they screwed it up, gave  it a happy ending. And all my friends,  I know they're going to smile and  say they loved it. No, they don't, do they? I don't have what they want, Harry. Harry, will you tell me something?  How can I keep making movies when  people in the streets are starving? But I don't want to be like that. I  want to do something... Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass  of myself. The hell you will, Harry York. Bong... bong... bong... It's midnight, Harry. My glittering  raiments are dissolving. He deserves a show. He missed the  movie. I know. A single glass slipper left glittering  on the pearly sands. Who was that  girl, anyway? 'Come and get it,' Harry. Hi Frances, got a minute? Sure, Claire. If you don't mind  walking my way. Well, I suppose I should just say  it. It's your clothes. My clothes? Yeah, I mean slacks... and work  clothes... and that awful car -- It's a perfectly good car. It runs. Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound...  it's just that the public expects  something different from its stars.  People won't take you seriously. I don't care if my clothes are taken  seriously. Or my car. You know what I mean. Uh-huh. You mean what if the public  finds out I perspire? And wear slacks.  And drive an old jalopy? What if  they find out I'm a real person. Oh  no! Say it ain't so! Not a real  person! Morning, Eddie. That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is  very concerned about your politics.  He hears you've been donating money,  speaking at rallies. Yup. Claire... please, please tell  Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as  much about his scripts as he does  about my private life, we'd make a  lot better movies. I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you  know? I know. 'This is a factory and we each have  our jobs. The writer writes, the  director directs, and the actress...' ...acts. I'll relay your message. Sort of. Who? Claire? Fired? ...Yes. Showdown. Dick, we need some time apart -- Dick, I can't even breathe here... Dick... No? What night? You want his name? My God... I think you're overplaying  this a bit...? Goodbye, Dick. Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have  to sell me. Who is she? And what's the title of this seduc...  assault? Hi. You wanted to talk? That's me, Clifford. I'm not! But I want to. I'm trying! Then show me! That's what I'm here  for, to learn, to grow! I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford. I'm not! I'm not! God damn it, Clifford, will you shut  up! I tell you, I want to give these  things! I want to give them to the  audience, and I can give them, I  will give them, so shut up! What? Thank you. Oh well. I guess I better leave then. Huh. I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't  me... I don't know who she fucked to get  where she is, but I don't think it  was me. That's not the point. Frances Farmer  has the world by the tit because of  this studio, and now she thinks she  can waltz off without a thank you.  No. No, that young lady has a  contract, and she's going to honor  it. I think it's time to take the gloves  off. Get me some reporters. Particularly Louella Parsons! Thank you very much. I'm glad you  liked the play. You can always come see it in London. I wouldn't miss it. Are you an actor? Are you really serious? About acting? Then don't go to Hollywood. I'm telling you straight, if you  have any serious ambitions, stay  clear of the place. It'll crush you. No, I don't hate it. ...Not if I can help it. They'll mend. What? What is this? Why, you... you little bastard! Just one minute... 'But how do I know you love me?' 'How do I know it's true? You'll get  to be the champ. They'll all want  you, all the girls! But I don't care.  I've been undersea a long time. When  they'd put their hands on me I used  to say, "This isn't it! This isn't  what I mean!" It's been a mysterious  world for me! But Joe, I think you're  it! I don't know why, I think you're  it. Take me home with you.' How's it sound? You think I got it? Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got  it. Hello, Harold. Where's Clifford? Oh. What's up? That's right. I don't want them  breathing down my neck while we're  in London. You don't think I'm good enough? Who? A rich actress. But... but wait a minute. We're  supposed to be different, right?  Clifford says... This theatre is  supposed to be different! And this  play... this play is all about what  greed and money do to people! What does Clifford say? Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he? Prick! Harry? Harry, where are you?! I called your god-damned office! I  want you to kill him, Harry. You'll  do that for me, won't you? I loved  him, I loved him... that bastard. Don't tell me what to do, just give  me his head on a platter! Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My  wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I  can't see you any more.' Just like  that! Harry, I hate being in love. I don't  ever want to be in love again. I  just hate it! For God's sake... why? Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to  my contract, but you can't break me.  I'm back, and I'm gonna make the  best of it. I'd like nothing better. This is a mistake. No. This is a  disaster. But we've been at it since six this  morning. At least you could've let  me go home and change. You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, let's go get 'em. So not only am I a troublesome bitch,  but I'm fat too? Frances! God, who's here? The usual vermin, I'm afraid. Get me a drink. Hi everybody. Connie, can I use the upstairs  bathroom? Sure. Come in. Hi. Refill my drink, will you, Bob? Putting on my armor. Louella... didn't she call me a  spoiled little bitch? 'Forgive'...? For What? You're not kidding. Get me a refill, Bob. I'll be down  in a minute. Thank you. You seem like an intelligent young  man. Can't you find a more dignified way  to make a living? In my eyes, officer. Come on. You're seriously trying to  tell me the Japs can't find Los  Angeles without my headlights? God, you bore me. Don't touch me! Take a look. How the hell do you find me anyway? What's left of my blood. Help yourself. Everyone else has. Nope. The studio pays. Thank you,  Harry. For not chopping off his head and  serving it to me on a platter. I took the early rounds. I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some  things, no matter what you do with  them, they just hurt. Yeah, and you look at people and you  wonder who the hell they are, what's  going on inside their heads. Sometimes  you can hear it, like a buzzing, the  things that happen in their heads.  And you wonder: does anybody ever  love anybody, really? I gotta get outta here. I gotta get  out of this town. No, Harry, I can't -- You know... when I started acting,  you know what I wanted? I just wanted to be part of  something... one thing, one play or  one movie, something that was really  fine... memorable. And I could say:  I did that, I made something good. Well... to get a crack at something  good, you gotta earn it, you gotta  climb the ladder first. So you do,  you work hard, and all these people  behind you are pushing you up,  shouting you on. And then one day  you realize you are, you're at the  top... and there's nothing there.  And you look behind you and there's  no one below. You're just left there  all alone... swaying in the god-damned  breeze. Hey, watch it. Get away from me, you foul slime. Who said I was a lady? Ahhh, go eat a toilet seat. What happened? Who're you? I live here. What? God damn it, god damn it... Yes, I'll wait, I'm waiting... I don't believe this. They can't do  this to me! Barnes? It's my diary! They stole my  fucking diary! Find it, will you?  Find it! God damn it, that's my life! I'd say I'm behaving as professionally  as anyone else in this town. Terribly, terribly sorry; I overslept.  What's the name of this fine  entertainment we're all so involved  in? Oh yes. "No Escape." That's it.  There's no escape. That's it! I'm not taking this any  more! I quit! Goodbye!... goodbye!... goodbye!... Shit. What the hell's going on here? Hold on! Hello... Hello? Hey! What...? Help! Don't kill me! Don't kill me! Mama, help me, help me, Mama! Don't  let them kill me! You have no right! You have no fucking  right, you bastards! Get the hell  out of here -- GET OUT! I don't believe this! You jerks drag  me down here in the middle of the  night and you don't even know who  the hell I am! Fifteen. Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant  vagabond. Come on, this is a joke!  Assault and battery? I barely touched  that bitch! Cocksucker. Hey! I'd like to leave a wake-up  call for say, ten? Hey! I'll have my  bread and water in bed! ...Take me the way I am. Who's writing this guy's lines? No, I couldn't get my hands on one. I never saw him. Why didn't he show  up? Why, certainly. I wanted to get a  peek at his face... That's fine with me... Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon,  c'mon, what is this, an audience or  a jury? Sure it's true. I was fighting for  my country as well as myself. Are you telling me you didn't have a  little rum in your pineapple juice  this morning? I can smell it from  here, Your Honor. It's the truth! I can smell it from  here -- you old hypocrite! Fine! Wait a minute... I haven't got a  lawyer... What I want to know is do I have any  civil rights? I want to make a phone call... I have a right to make a phone call! They're stealing my civil rights!  Help me! I'm being kidnapped! Oh  God, help me! Help me! Haven't you ever had a broken heart? Harry! I have a right! I have a right! ...and we feel that this would be  more appropriate. What? It's alright now, little sister,  everything's going to be just fine. Mama, what's... Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail,  Frances. The Judge has put you under  my care. I'll see you get the rest  you need. You're taking me home! First things first, little sister.  Trust me. Why it's beautiful here! What a view! Good afternoon, Doctor. Oh. Well, I have some background  that you should probably know about  if you're... I'll be back real soon, little sister.  You be a good girl. Mama! ...I want to go home, Mama. You'll see, little sister. Everything  will be fine. The doctors know best. Am I supposed to say 'thank you'? Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'. It ain't for lack of trying. Why, Doctor! We've only just met! Oh! Are you really? Do you expect me, for one moment, to  believe you have greater insight  into my personality than I do? You may discuss my predicament,  Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone  you like, but not with me. I'm not  interested. I can solve my problems  without recourse to a veternarian. Besides, I don't want to be what you  want to make me. Normal. Average. ...Did you really say that? This whole thing is a joke! No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're  finding that difficult, aren't you? Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps  later, in some of our more intimate  sessions... after we know each other  a little better... and you've torn my personality to  shreds, and I'm weeping and  vulnerable... then you'll really get your kicks,  won't you, "Doctor?" Oh, that's good, very professional.  In control. But the tiny beads of  sweat on your upper lip give you  away. You didn't say 'Symington says'. Not much on hospital corners, are  you? So this is the nuthouse... Honey... take my word for it. This  is a resort. You have no right! Tell them who I am! Tell them who I  am! Are you crazy? Unhand that woman!  That's Amelia Earhart! But what is it? You've got to tell me what it is! It's insulin. It throws your body  into shock. It's just vitamins. A, C, B-Complex, certain minerals... Just stay relaxed... Good, now open  your mouth a sec. ...and here's the one from Duluth. A  war widow with five children. She  works in a defense plant and she's  very worried about you. I answered  her that she shouldn't let worry  over you affect her vital work; and  that you'd be back on the silver  screen in no time. And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss.  He says that... Why are these all opened? Well, they needed immediate answers,  Frances. It's good manners and good  sense. You shouldn't be bothering  yourself with these right now. Then why did you bring them? It's your fan mail, little sister. You kill me, Mama. What? Go on... Yes. It was very good to see her. Not at all. She brought me my fan  mail. I had no idea there were so many  strangers concerned about me. But I  guess that's the best thing about  working in the movies. You make so  many friends. I want to go back and  show them that the faith they put in  me wasn't a mistake. No... What I mean is... I'm just  very excited by the prospect of  getting on with my life, that's all. What? I never said... Oh look. That's just  a figure of speech. She said something  funny, and I said... Oh for Christ's... I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's  all. Doctor, I hate to break this to you,  but my mother is a little batty. You what? Dr. Symington, how big is your dick? 'Cause if it's long enough, which I  doubt, why don't you wrap it around  and fuck yourself in the ass! I want outta here, you understand?  I'm ready to get out! So you go back  there... you go back and you tell  them to let me out! No, I'm warning you! Who do you think  you are, God? You bumble around with  your folders... ...and your pencils... ...and your god-damn buttons... ...all your badges of authority! But  you have no authority! You're nothing!  You're a zero! Symington says... Oh my God, I look awful. They're doin' stuff to me, Harry.  Can you see it? You feel it? They're  putting stuff in my food or something,  my water, and they're using it to  put thoughts in my head. You  understand? They're trying to re- arrange what's in my head, they're  trying to drive me crazy! Oh, Harry! I can't stay here anymore, you  understand? I can't, I can't. I gotta  get home. I gotta get somewhere else,  anywhere, okay? Oh good. I love my baths. Of course, Harry. Over the walls! That sure looks like fun... You know how long it's been since I  was behind the wheel? Have I told you how mean you're  turning, York? Where are we, mean man? I should've known... This is another one of your schemes  to get me off alone... (smiling) ...Take advantage of me. I don't think I'd be much good in a  war... I don't know. Not a war exactly.  It's more a... a misapprehension  maybe... A misunderstanding, people taking  the wrong meaning from things. I  wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was  just saying my prayers. Harry, I have to go home. I have to  talk to Mama. No, she just didn't want me going to  jail, that's all. You know something, Harry? Aside from meanness, you're almost  perfect. There's only one other thing  wrong with you. You can't drink. Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch! What a man! To quarter-horses. Why are you always leaving me, Harry? You should stickaround sometimes.  Look out for me. I know a thing or two about marriage.  You... you understand me more than  anyone, Harry... maybe even more  than Mama. But... you're too important  to me. I'd fail you. I don't know  how or why, but I would. And that's  a chance I just can't take. Do you  understand? What's that? Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't  explain it. She's my mother. She's  just... I can't give up on her that  easy. Yeah. It's just... something I gotta  do, I guess. I know. Don't tell anyone. I got your number, Mister Man. Welcome home, little sister. Well, who have we here...? Frances, you remember my lawyer,  Alma Styles? I called Alma because I think we'll  need... I swear I didn't know what they were  doing to you. I wouldn't have let  them... It's okay, Mama. It's okay. You leave him out of this! Frances, please don't... Frances, play 'Flow Gently Sweet  Afton'. Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that  song. Please. I want you to. It would make  me so happy. It's just a flow gently sweet Afton  day. Life has been so good to me.  Why, I have just about everything  one could wish... but I still have  so many blank pages in my scrapbook. I think I need a little air. What's wrong? Nothing. I think I'll just go out  for awhile. Where are you going? For a walk, Mama. Just a walk. How long will you be? Not long. I'll have lunch ready by one. I'll be back. At one. Promise? Sure. Say you promise. I promise I'll... I promise, Mama. You know, the surest way to lose an  appetite, is to drink, little sister. Yes, Mama. I don't want you drinking, Frances. Yes, Mama. ...So what do you think? I know that, Dad, but -- But Dad, I'm asking about me. What  do you think I should do? Dad... whatever I decide, will it be  okay with you? I don't care, Dad. I love you. I'm back, Mama. Oh Frances, do I have news for you!  Guess who -- Wait, Mama, wait. I have something  to tell you. I've decided... well...  I'm not going to make movies anymore.  I thought that's what I wanted, and  I went after it with all my soul,  the way you taught me, but I was  miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed  me. So now... now it's over. I want  a different kind of life, something...  simple. I want to live someplace  quiet and peaceful... in the country  maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats --  I feel so light suddenly, so clear  for the first time in... It's going  to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I  love you. Don't... talk crazy. Mama...? They want you back! Your agent called  today! Don't you understand? He's  sending the scripts. He wants to fly  up here in a week with the publicity  people! Frances, you can't do this  to your fans! Why, they've been  praying for you all through this  nightmare. You can't turn your back  on them now! Look at this fan mail  I've been answering! Haven't you heard what I said? I told him to come up! I told him  you wanted to show them all that  there's nothing wrong with you any  more, that you're completely cured! I'm not cured. I was never sick!  They had no business putting me in  there! My only responsibility is to  myself now! You... you selfish, selfish child.  At least talk to him, hear what he  has to say. No! You want to throw it all away, is  that it? You had everything, little  sister. Beauty... a brilliant  career... a wonderful husband. You  were a movie star! Mama, shut up! And now you're throwing everything  away? You're gonna be a nobody!  Nobody! You know what that's like?! You... You'd send me back, wouldn't  you? You would. Where are you going? I'm going out! You're not going anywhere! Yes, I am, and you can't stop me!  You can't tell me what to do, mother.  I'm a grown woman, and I can decide  about my own life. Frances! Don't you try and stop me. Don't you  dare! If you follow me, Mama, I swear I'll  fucking kill you! That's it. You've done it now, little  sister. All my life, I've tried to live up  to my parents' example. To have the  independence of mind and fortitude  of spirit that have made this country  great. I taught that to Frances:  Speak out. Aspire. Make something of  yourself, something -- Frances has always been a  battleground, Lillian. Well... yes. No... I mean, yes, Doctor. Well, Alma told me that... ...Yes. Her married name? ...Oh yes. ...Looking for a drink, and the town  is deserted, he can't understand it.  Finally he finds a bar, goes in --  the place is empty, bartender's  closing up. Salesman says, 'Gimme a  martini.' Bartender's real nervous,  he says, 'No, no, no, I gotta close.  Big Otis is coming to town.' Salesman says, 'I don't care. I gotta  have a martini.' So the bartender  fixes him a martini real fast, grabs  his money, and runs out the back.  Salesman sits there sipping his  martini,... he's got the bar all to  himself... Then he hears it. This  big roaring in the street. Enormous hands reach in, grab the  swinging doors and rip them off their  hinges. This huge man stomps in.  Picks up a chair and hurls it over  the bar, smashing the mirror --  whiskey and glass flying everywhere. He turns to the salesman: 'What the  hell're you doing in here!' Salesman  says, 'I'm just drinking a martini.'  'Oh yeah?' the guy says. 'Well you  better get outa here! Big Otis is  coming to town!' Doctor, it may sound odd, but I  believe I've profited from my stay  here. It's just what I've needed, to  get away like this. But I'm  recuperated now. I've had lots of  time to think and I've made a few  decisions about my life. I'm ready  to get on with it. ...Don't you? No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I  know better. You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor,  tell me honestly, what do I have to  do to get out of here? ...I see. One question. If I'm not myself now,  just who do you think I am? What the hell! Come and get it! Come and get it!  Come and get it! We want Frances! We want Frances! Come and get it... Who? ...Touch me again and I'll kill you,  you pig. Please! Take me! I'm grateful... grateful. I'm grateful! I'm grateful! Harry, please! I love you, Harry. I love you. I realize now that I was a very sick  woman. Sick! She's sick! I couldn't relate to others in a  normal way. And I was not taking responsibility  for my actions. But now, thanks to  your treatment, I feel ready to face  myself, ready to resume the career  which I so single-handedly shattered.  I only hope... I hope I can make you  all proud of me. Thank you. Thank  you so much. Of course, she hasn't anything  definite in mind. No. No, it all depends on what offers  I get. Well, I like to try different styles.  Sometimes if you're old-fashioned  enough, you find you're modern. Right,  Mama? It's a miracle. Just a miracle. Oh, just leave those things for now. No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll  wash them in the morning. You know, little sister, I never  resented you for refusing to see me  in the... the hospital. I knew you  had to manage on your own before you  could come back. Thank you for understanding, Mama. Little sister, I don't want you to  feel any rush to get back to work. I  want you to rest... for a while  anyway. I will, I promise. Good night, dear. Oh Harry... Yeah. I don't know. I know, but... There were so many  people in there, Harry. Every time I  turned around someone was pressing  against me... watching, looking over  my shoulder, touching me, grabbing,  sticking things into me. When I feel  somebody near me now... anybody...  my skin starts to crawl. You can't change the things they did  to me, Harry. Only I can do that...  by myself. Oh please, Harry... don't even think  it. You're the only person who ever...  It's just... Can't you wait for me? Yes you do. If you love me you can  wait, right? A month, six months,  whatever it takes. No, Harry, it's not time, it's us.  You and me. And I'm telling you now  that I'll come to you, okay? I'll  find you. I will. I'm sorry. It's always beautiful at this time.  Peaceful... Yes. Wherever they're going, I'm going. Well, I was picking fruit with some  migrant workers until... Yeah. You know, I've never been able to  figure that out. Thank you. Wait. Maybe they'll pick you up. Shit! Dad...? Why don't you stop at a side  road and let me out? Why? It's such a simple thing. You  just let me out and I disappear down  a road and you never have to see me  again. Dad, here! You don't have to stop,  just slow down. You can tell Mama I  jumped out. She knows that's the  kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame  you. You know where you're taking me. You  know what she'll do. Just give me a  minute, slow down, give me an instant  for once in your life, please? Daddy! I pity us, Dad. I pity us both. Do I go right away or do I have time  to take a bath? I was hoping for a kind word, little  sister. You were hoping for a kind word?!  You're my mother! You're supposed to  nourish me! Support me! I have! No! All you've done is try to break  my spirit, try to turn me into you!  But I'm not you, mother, and I never  will be, and thank god for it! That goes for you too! And frankly,  I don't know how, with the two of  you, I turned out as sane as I am -- Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be  with you in a minute... and believe  me, I don't want to stay here one  second longer than I have to! But I've got to tell you, Lillian,  that one day before you die, you  will realize what you've done and  hang your head in shame. In shame! But what -- No! You're not talking now. You  listen. You can send me away, Lillian,  you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend  I'm still your little girl who can't  take care of herself, but one thing  you can't pretend anymore. You can't  pretend I love you because I don't.  I can't. Not after what you've done  to me. Because you see... I'm still  me... I'm trying real hard all this  time to be me... and you, 'little  sister', you haven't been any help  at all. Okay, boys, I'm ready. We shall hear the angels, we shall  see the whole sky all diamonds... Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come.  I love you, Harry. I love... Take me  home, Harry. Thank you, Harry. What was I saying? Oh yes, it was  the Communists that did it to Frances. They capture the mind by first  seducing the heart. I suppose I never  taught Frances to close her heart... Pardon? Oh, would you like more  lemonade? You know, Ernie, I think we should  have Frances' room repainted for  when she comes home. That'll brighten  her day. ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever  was sick. But when you're treated  like a patient long enough, you're  apt to act like one... No. No. Never. Thank you, Ralph. Where shall we drop you, Frances?  Home? No... no, someone's picking me up. Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see  you. Fine, thank you. Did you watch the  show? How did I look? Well... you're looking well. I got a new car. Only it's red. Did  you know Mama died? Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a  faceless sinner, Harry... I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm  a faceless sinner. ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar,  you know? I'd ask you to take me  home, but... Don't get mad at me, Harry. Please.  It's just... Some things happen for  the best. It's going to be slow from now on.  Do you know what I mean, Harry? Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we? No, we're not. Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to  see you again. That would be okay.
