I'm fine, Sam. I was worried about you. Sure you don't want me to move over? Are we gonna watch this movie or what? Oh, that was so sad! Relationships don't have to be like that! I can see why you like this so much. It reminded me of you. I didn't say I liked it, I said it reminded me of you. It reminded me of what I didn't like about you, the cynicism, the neurotic insecurity, and oh yeah, when you started calling me every day. All the reasons we were never more than friends. Of course I'm being honest. This is a fantasy extrapolated from a flashback. How could I lie to you? AND WHAT IS IT WITH JEWISH MEN AND THEIR Who won? I can't believe you! Did you get in trouble? So what'd you do?! What? Don't you like me? How would you know? You see dead people? Max... Sure. I'd love to. How's tomorrow night? Great. I know the perfect thing. She splits, leaving Max befuddled at his change of fortune. Never? A perfect record. Wow. But you can tell with everybody? I don't know if that's sad or incredible. Living with you would be a nightmare. I'd be afraid to bring any boyfriends home. Oh, uh, sorry. You guys never talk about anything important anyway. Like whether Voltron could kill the Transformers? For such "close" friends, it just seems weird, that's all. I must admit, I'm a lot closer to you than any of them. Yes, that's us. Isn't this great? What do you mean? Oh, shhh...! Can't you just enjoy the moment? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. I loved it, I'm serious. I'm so glad we did this. But man, relationships are a lot of work, aren't they? If I'm going to jump into anything with you, Max, I need some sign that you're serious about it. About me. Look, you've gotta admit, you're the most pessimistic person in the world. Can you be serious for a second? Look, Max, this isn't going to work. Okay. No more jokes. Now. Tell me how you feel. About me. Well, that was intimate. Thanks, Max. Max, I don't think this is such a good idea. I mean, it would be really foolish to jeopardize our friendship. We shouldn't have rushed into this. I'm sure you know it wouldn't have worked out. Please tell me we haven't hurt our friendship. You don't even know how much you mean to me. You're going out? You know I have to work until midnight. It's not my fault the supervisor won't let me out of it. So Scott... How come you're not going out with Charles and Max? Oh really? I have work, too, but it's okay, I got a lot done today. What do you have to do? Ta-daaa! Hey guys, what's going on? (doesn't get it, doesn't care) Oh. Well, I just wanted to stop by and say "hey" to my favorite guys. So hey! How was everyone's break? Mine was great! I partied with my best friend Melanie, who I haven't seen in ages. Aren't these parties just the best? So much better than the theater group parties. Hey, Charles, you going to the fraternity party after this? You gonna be back at your suite then? Maybe I'll stop by. Okay then, I'll catch up with you guys later. I missed you. I'm sorry to interrupt, I thought I heard one of you say "Max." Oh, great, just as I hoped. I just wanted to say, I heard your radio show last week and I thought it was great. Thoughtful and poignant and funny, too. You know, you look just like I imagined, too. Huh? You're Max? Then who are you? You okay? You look like you're in pain. I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't supposed to listen. Alright, listen. I was kidding. Your show actually kind of sucked. Just kidding! It was awesome. At one point you dialed a phone sex line. It was hilarious. It's not every day someone calls 1-900-4RIMJOBS to discuss politics. Yeah, it's like, for four dollars a minute, you should talk about whatever you want. You know the country's in trouble when a phone sex operator thinks talking politics is beneath her. Listen, I'm being flagged down by my over- protective friends. It was nice meeting you, though. Someone mentioned you. It was from a good source. I was told I'd like you, but to really know you, I should hear your show. It was Beth. Uh, hi, Max. Guess who? It's Beth. Been a while, huh? Since that lunch last August that somehow never happened. Anyway, uh, just checking in, I guess. Hope your break was okay. Uh, and---- It's all right, this isn't the first time this has happened. At least this time I'm not the naked one. Hmm, yeah, I must have shown up after you came back, or something. I was planning to go home, but I guess I fell asleep. She waits for something from Charles. He doesn't respond. She reluctantly gets to her feet. Anyway, I, uh, I've got a bunch of stuff to do. I'll see you later. Wasn't it supposed to rain? Max, it's been ten minutes and we're still discussing the weather. I just feel like there are other things we could be talking about. You're the one person I could rely on to say something original. This was a mistake, wasn't it? Look, let's just call it a day. I was excited to hear from you, but I can't take you like this. A COUPLE exit, the guy holds the door for them. They hesitate. Suddenly, from inside: Oh my, God, Beth! It's great to see you! It's been so long! How did we ever fall out of touch? We shouldn't let that happen again. I know! I even miss this place. I live on the wrong side of campus now. You guys still come here? It's so dark and the menu is tiny. Maybe an omelet. So don't get the eggs. Are you serious? How can you be allergic to the smell of my eggs? Don't worry about it, Jen. He's just incredibly picky about food. Why can't you just get along with everyone for once? What makes you so sure I'm gonna switch? I don't think I'm gonna move. Okay, I'll get up. But I'm ordering an omelet. She sits down next to Charles and they smile at each other. Hi. Look at this line. Aren't ATMs great? They save so much time. Think about what life must have been like before them. I'm listed as a sophomore, but I've taken some time off. Why is that always the first question? And how would you answer it? I bet. Me, I'm in Soc., but I'm leaning toward Business, or Psych. Or Art History. Not my style. Max's turn-- but he spots ANNIE HALL on the marquee. Impulsively, he turns Julie to face him, so that her back is to it. In doing so, he steps away from the ATM. Are you okay? I thought you needed money. Seriously, is everything okay? What? It's Julie, no nickname. Don't even think of calling me "Jewel." Probably. She leaves. Max goes back to the end of the line. How was your day? Scott, how's the design project coming? Huh. The Ani DiFranco show? Awesome! That's been sold out for weeks! Oh. I dunno. Why don't you call me tomorrow during the day. It's getting late. See you guys later. Tired yet? You're so paranoid. Max, do I bother Scott when I'm around? `Cuz, sometimes it seems like I do. I know he's not, like, interested, but then, sometimes it seems like he is. I just don't want it to be awkward. Please, tell me the truth. So he never talks about me? I knew it. So with all the time we spend together, none of you have any opinion of me?! It's time! To unroll the film. I know. It's just sometimes, I wish... Something's missing? Max! What's going on? Do you guys know Max? This is Mark... ...And Andy. Sure. You want mine? Andy, what are you looking for? Gee, Mark, that's really cool. Mark, lay off. Go take a hit off the Hoover and mellow out. (turning to Max) Max, I'm sorry. Nah, it's time. It's getting late anyway. She puts out her cigarette and grabs her coat. No, well, a little, sure. But there are always men around. During fire drills, more guys come out than girls. Never the same ones either. They come and go. I had a good time tonight, but next time, let's have some real fun. Good night, Max. Julie enters the dorm. Max watches her through the glass. It was great running into your friends, but... you know... I feel bad about what I said. Do you want to get together later? Come on, it's bad enough we fell out of touch, but we can't even have lunch? Every time we try to do anything, you have an excuse, or forget to show up, or you cancel. I'm sorry. Things have been a little, you know, awkward. Now you're only going because I gave you a hard time. Okay, how is the Kidney Bean at noon? The Fabulous Diner, then. Friday at noon? And then I got to thinking, you know, I really think I like vanilla. Sam turns off the car. Hello... Big night? I would hope so. Oh, of course. Hey, that's my new major. I got so sick of Soc. Well, there's a great local band playing the Pub. You should come. Great. I'll see you there. Scott, can I ask you something? It's just that, sometimes, you're really cool and other times you act like I'm not even here. Or like you don't want me around. Well, I was wondering if... never mind. All right, look, I'm just going to come right out with it. I think I like you. I think I, I really like you. Hey! They're Anhedonia. They're "sludge-core." That's their trademark. They insult the crowd at the end of the set. Sometimes he breaks the mike two songs in. We were lucky: they played for almost 40 minutes. Look, the mike's not even broken. They were just tired of playing, but they wanted to give us something to remember. Now that's showmanship. It worked for The Who. Ha ha. Come on, is that the kind of a joke a celebrity DJ would make? You're a riot. Let's get out of here. She pulls him away. Oh, Mark. He's been following me around for years. He's easily threatened. Don't worry about him, he isn't a threat. You're far more interesting. You're not fooling me, you know. I can see right through this aloof image. It's not an insult. I get the sense that there's this whole other side of your personality. See, this is the side you show, playing everything off as a joke whenever things gets serious. But there's more to you. Quick. Now. Tell me something about yourself, something I never would have guessed. And don't even try to come up with some witty retort. I should get going. (off-balance, covering) You don't know what I'm wishing for. Max, there are a lot of girls that would go for a guy like you. This is one of those moments, in a movie, when a character has a chance to say something, and of course they do, and it's perfect, and it becomes a movie moment. Julie starts to lean in. Suddenly, the BUILDING MANAGER walks in. He's a dead ringer for Woody Allen. Max starts violently. Are you hungry at all? Sounds perfect. They walk out. Ernest Borgnine? Yeah, I noticed that too. That's a scary gift. I mean, even if people are destined to break up, the will to stay together is very powerful. I don't know if your gift is really that special, Max. I mean, we break up with everyone we ever date... Until the one we stay with forever. How did you get this attitude if you love Annie Hall? Actually, it's stuck on it. It's how I first heard your show. It doesn't matter, Max. Now that I've met you, your show's not important. This is a nice place. Ritzy. Interesting mix of people here, you've got these men with their suits, taking their waitress girlfriends out to impress them into bed, because they can't get them any other way. Really, as if a fast car can ever make up for a small dick. Guys, always obsessed with dick size. Let's guess which couples are destined to break up. How about them? Indicates a COUPLE dancing. Hi! Do you have a boyfriend? Max is aghast. Donna stares a beat. Yeah. What do you need to know? Describe him for us. It's okay, I'm a psyche major. Well, he's tall... ish. Brown hair. Funny. Very friendly. Fixes cars. Close with his brother. Uh, what else? Believes in God. Has a sweet tooth. Uh... So can I take your order? We're not ready, thanks. So what was that all about then? Max here thinks you're going to break up with your boyfriend. What? Hey! Don't shoot the messenger! Hey, we're all people here, right? If you want to talk to someone, talk to them. I don't spend my time trying to justify talking to people or whatever. You limit yourself if you do that. If you spend too much time worrying, you don't spend enough time living, right? You have to keep yourself open to possibilities in life. I'm the first one in my family to go to college. Sometimes I can't believe I'm here, at a semi- prestigious university getting a halfway- decent education-- this has always been my dream. How did you end up here? I know what you mean, financial aid is a bitch. And the university experience itself is kind of disappointing. All those rich students with no idea how lucky they are. But I don't think about them. I think about me, I think about where I want to be someday: a world traveler, running some huge company, or, you know, doing some fantastically important work. And when the day comes that I can relax, I'm going to charter a boat, sail around the world, and see the Seven Wonders. Come on, aren't you curious about the world? Doesn't the sheer scope of life fill you with wonder? Ah, Max... Max? What are you doing here? A sudden craving for bird-seed? Well, be careful, someone in the corner is eating egg salad. Max sits down across from her. After an awkward pause: Are you okay? No reason. Something about you sounded different. No, actually, last night on the... Oh no, he's here. Who is he with? He never calls me anymore. I think he might be seeing someone. Have you heard anything? Sort of. Well, no, I guess not. I know something's going on. I'm such a fool. Why are we always attracted to people that are completely wrong for us? Is it because they excite us? I can be a rebel too. The other day I went to bed without flossing. Okay, it's pathetic, but we're okay, you know? But sometimes, I feel like... I'm glad you're here, Max. I didn't realize how much I missed you. That's not what I meant, Max. She heads for the exit. Hello? Can I help you? Hey! Are you Max? Oh wow! You're just like she described. Hi, I'm Judy. I'm sure she mentions me all the time. Come in, come in. Make yourself at home. This may be completely inappropriate, but can I ask you something? The tattoo� did it hurt? Why didn't you use your frat's logo? On the left. She's got the single. Max! What are you doing here? You know, I think I'm going to get a tattoo, too. Judy, Mark has the tattoo. This is Max. What? You're Max? Yeah, isn't he great? Sure. What a surprise! What brings you here? It was excellent, how was yours? Yeah? Anyone I know? Really? For lunch? Charles! Can you believe Stacy at rehearsal?! She jumps on the stool next to him. Charles turns to Max for help but he's already gone. (not looking up) So glad you could make it. Thank God for small favors. Yeah, a little. This semester isn't shaping up too well. It's tough getting back into the groove of things and, you know, being on campus. Yourself? But there's something? Really? Who is it? Do I know her? Julie! She's great. Why aren't you thrilled? This I gotta hear. Well, of course, why do you think I sent her to you? What're you talking about? Jeez, she's not like Annie when the film starts, she's like Annie at the end. Or maybe, the Millennium Edition. Max, what's really the problem here? You have a type? Who would you rather sleep with, Julie or Annie Hall? Okay, Annie Hall or me? Stop delaying. This is a serious hypothetical question. I'll take what I can get. You joke while you're in bed? That's so weird. No, it's weird because I do the same thing. Guys find it annoying. Julie doesn't. And you really like her. Happiness? Max, you wouldn't know what to do with it if you had it. It is, but I saw it a couple of weeks ago. I don't think I can sit through it again. You mentioned something about Annie Hall the other night. Do you have that lying around? Isn't that it on the end there? Sure it is. No, it isn't. You don't believe your friend's theory, right? Because it's insulting. A cop-out. Oh, good idea. But next time, Annie Hall. Max puts in Airplane. Julie and Max sit on a couch together. What are you�? Why did you back away? It wasn't me, I wouldn't have backed away. Ow. No, it's okay. It's okay. Shut up already. Nice to meet you guys, but I was just leaving. I have work to do before class tomorrow. Sure, all right. Boys, nice to meet you. Max leaves with Julie. I wish I had a cigarette. Me too. It's strangely sexy when guys smoke. So. You and Beth are pretty close, huh? She really cares about you. It's great that you're still friends. Sometimes this place annoys me. There's so much bullshit. My semester off was the right idea. What happened to old- fashioned hard work? Why not just set your tuition on fire? So, get on up, lazy. How can you be shy, after, you know...? You have a problem with nudity. It's too easy. Max puts his jeans on, shoves his underwear and socks in his pocket. A double-shift, I get out at five. This week's gonna suck. I have homework that can't be avoided. Nice try, Max. I thought you had homework and stuff, you liar. Great song, by the way. Come on, you're funny, you have good taste in music... My radio days are over, I'm now deaf. You were only playing music. Wow... You're a real piece of work, you know that, Max? This has been some crazy week. I still have a six page paper due Monday. Don't worry about it, I needed a break. Good to get out and enjoy the weather. No. I'm from northern Vermont. Not too far from Canada. It sucked but I managed. Read a lot. Had a few close friends. That's all you need. It's quiet up there, dull but nice. Will you relax? I know how to drive. I've got it under control, Max! Oh, yeah? She drags on her cigarette. Did you just call me your girlfriend? Ah well, I guess that's alright. Boyfriend. She looks at Max and smiles. Beth, I can't believe you're graduating so early. Yeah. I've spent my life learning how to be a student, and at the end of the semester it will all be useless. Everybody already wants to know what I'm going to do, and I have no idea. I started making up stories to tell people. An aunt asked me if I'm excited about Chicago, and I couldn't remember if I'd said I was moving to the city or going to see the band. I can't believe I'm graduating. My whole life, I've known what was next. But when I graduate, the next step is... something? Something that pays the bills. Now I know where you get it from. You should do whatever makes you happy. You have plenty of time, dear. Come on, Charles, show a little dignity. What are you talking about?! Fine! We make you sick? Sam, say something to him! How dare you! You think everything's okay if it's true, but some things are true and not okay! Please, guys, it's my birthday. We're here to celebrate. Goddamn it, Scott, I am so sick of you making fun of me! You are the meanest person I've ever met and I don't know why anybody even talks to you! You are such an asshole! No. Yes. Ah... So... Julie. I heard you switched majors. Yes, I'm Psych now. I didn't like Soc. I'm a Soc. major. Oh sorry, I just meant, I needed something more, ya know, relevant. Well, look, I'm only in college for the degree. Most of the stuff they teach us is pointless anyway. College is a great opportunity. It's about more than getting a job. Yeah, it's about avoiding the real world for as long as possible. You call theater the real world? Hey! Some of us work really hard to get through school. Look, my parents worked their whole lives to give me the opportunity to be here. But the truth is, private schools like ours make money by showing students a good time for four years. It's bullshit. You think social work is bullshit? That's not what I-- Why don't you just drop out if everything's such bullshit? God. What a bunch of spoiled, whiny college brats. Nobody has anything more to say. Everyone looks away. Max is shell-shocked. No, it's okay. I just need a few hours to work. Okay, see you later. She peels out. Hey. Sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe what cross-campus traffic was like. No, you've got something here that I've been looking forward to all week. She grabs Annie Hall from the shelf. You must face your fears. Relax, it's a very positive film. You just have to know how to look at it. It's really refreshingly positive. You know, I think I prefer Manhattan. It's just deeper, more sophisticated, I guess. Listen, thanks for dinner and the movie tonight, but I should get going. I don't know if this is a good idea right now. Listen, since the other night, I've been doing some thinking... I don't think that this is a good time for us to jump, or leap, or whatever, you know, together. Into a relationship. Did we? Well, you're right, Max, and this relationship was worth it. Are you okay? Will you please calm down? I like you very much, but I told you, I just got out of a serious relationship, and it ended really badly. We saw each other almost every day at the beginning, but by the end of the semester, I hadn't seen him in a month. He stopped returning my calls and stuff, and I mean, he basically avoided me, then I heard he was seeing one of my friends. It's nobody's fault, I know. I mean, I've been trying but it's hard. Relationships are very difficult to maintain. There are so few successful couples. My parents are divorced. Max, I did, believe me. I don't know what I was doing. I didn't think about where this might lead until it was too late. Say something. Are you okay? Jesus, Max. It's not an anti-relationship movie. You're not listening to me, Max. Just like you're not listening to Annie. No matter what you think right now, this was worth it. Because I got to meet you, and got to be close to you. Yeah. Yeah. She gets up and leaves the room. Hi there. Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah, I hate Valentine's Day, too. If you're in love, you're in love. And if you're not, who wants to think about it? I want to be in love so badly, don't you? Ah, forget it, Max. Does a bear shit in the woods? You told it the night of our date. I hate that joke, Max. It's not a philosophy. Yeah, and it's dreary and depressing, right? No? Really? Then allow me to recommend a movie that you've never seen before. It's called Annie Hall. I would love to, but I think you need to do this alone. But I'll see you later? The end of an era.
