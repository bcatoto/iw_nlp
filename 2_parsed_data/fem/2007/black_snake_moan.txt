Think this about money still, ya old  fool? How many times we been over this,  Laz? How many times? Thought we was gonna be friendly  about this. I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin'  with you. I feel it. Like I'm one  foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to  my momma. And that's not gonna happen  to me. I got living to do. Talk to me about sick. Ain't been  right since I moved into that drafty  house. That damned, rusty, radiator, bout  burned the skin off my legs each  time I passed. I deserve better than this. Better than what you give. Laz... You can't say nothin'... I don't love ya no more. I'm sorry you hurtin'. But, like I  say, this the only life I got. I said my piece. Let go... Let go of my arm... LAZ, I said let...! Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME! Yeah, go'on! Look! See if I give a  shit about any of you people! You got any money? I said we wasn't gonna talk about  him. Save that hustle talk to them field  ballers you sell crack to. Stolen phone cards and two-ways is  what you sayin'. Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful  of Jack'll do it. The hell you call me? Just got a cough. If it weren't you could kiss my rebel  cootch, ya faggot. Cough drops or condoms? Didn't know you was workin' here  now? I just like dressin' up in these  goddamn blue vests. Your money ticket get shipped today? You let me know if I can be of any  assistance. You gonna put some Luther Vandross  in here? Shit, he black ain't he? Why you stop havin' dancin' on  Saturday? Used to have bands... all  kind's live shit. Like a wake up in  here, now. You seen my snake-skin shoes? They're from New York. My niece gets  'em on the computer. Naw. They got some blue dye, though.  You think them boots you got on come  from a black cow? Don't gotta tell me. Me and my  girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them  hard fingertips he got pickin' that  guitar. They still hard? I know you hurtin', Laz. I got ears,  you know. But you should know more'n  me... ain't no better cure for them  blues than some good pussy. It's so stupid. Says to me that he  don't want nothin' to do with no  military career. Says he wants to  move. Open up an auto shop with his  uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay.  How about now? Let's go. He'd be good for that. Shit, Ronnie  knows cars. He get stubborn. Starts talkin' 'bout  obligation and duty and all that...  Shit. I just want him to come home...  I swear, if somethin' happens to  him... He fixed up that Buick for my uncle  Dale. He say it purrs like a kitten  every morning. Can't be thinkin' bout him every  second of my day. I'll go outta my  gourd. I begged him not to go. And he did. Satellites... You mean in space? Good thing you can block, Conner,  cuz you're dumb as a sack of shit. It gets worse there. Leavin' me to  my own mind. That's just not good. Yeah. Be right back. It's not like I can't go out and  have fun with my friends. You think I'm Ronnie's spy or  somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world  tryin' to keep his head on his  shoulders. You think he's gonna be  thinkin' about you? You go to hell. How many to fuck me up? Oh... I'm just on a water bed... And  it's just... so... Goddamn... funny! Hi. You ain't the kicker, are you? Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta  run the ball more. You get into a  kicking game, ya'll gonna lose. Okay. Jes? Jesse? Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP! Stop what? The ground is... turnin' upside down.  I'm gonna... I'm gonna fall off... Oh. That feels so much better. Thought you had a skirt earlier. I got others. This thing you got... I've heard  people say, you'd fuck a tree if it  was handy. I can see that. But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks  he's some player cuz he hustles dope  and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can  see a tree. But that piece of shit? I begged him. Don't see why he had  to go... I bet you did. Just had to get that  black cock up in you. I swear to  God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust  me. The fuck you laughin' at? You don't got half what Tehronne  got. Get up! I ain't playin'! OPEN YOUR Oh, Jesus... Teh... Tehronne? Lazarus? I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I  wear for my back. I'm standing most of my day. They're  for support. Didn't see you in church this mornin'. Well. It's good to see you. Yes? Go on, Laz. You can talk to me. You take her to a doctor? You wait right here. Mm-mm... Mm-mm... NOOOOO! Is your niece older than 12? My sister got a bad cough with her  pneumonia. I just copied her  prescription. You don't need to pay  anything... just take it. But if she  gets worse, you give me a call. I  wrote my number on the box. Not if no one finds out. I already tossed that out. Somethin' you should'a done to that  woman long ago... how she treated  you. Of course, that's none of my  business. ...you don't... touch me... s'no...  NO! Mm-mm... Mm-MMMMMMMMMMMMM! N- N'you FUCK! Mm-mm... mm-mm... Ma-muh... Ma-MUH! See... S... See if'I GIVE... GIVE'A... Ronnie... Ronnie... RONNIE! Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE! Mm-mm... Mm-mm... NO! NOOO! NOOOOOOOOOO! Is'okay... Is'okay... How long... how long I been out? Two days? Where's Ronnie? Wait. He left. I don't got any money... for fixin'  me up and all. Then I better be on my way. Don't  wanna put you out no more. Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way. Why you got me chained? The fuck you been doin' to me? Get this Goddamn thing off me! Well I'm woke now... you can take  this off. I'm right enough to stand on my own  two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain  off... What? Do me? Do me like this, you mean?  Like chainin' me up? The hell you know about me?! You got  no right to talk to me about that  shit! The hell you think you are? What do you want? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?! You some kind'a pervert? Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck  the spirit into me... Look it, mister... you wanna have  your way, you take it. I'll do  whatever you want. But you gotta let  me go. You can't do this! You can't SOMEBODY! SOMEBODY HELP ME! LET ME GO! Or what? Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS! Okay... OKAY! I'M COMIN' IN! NOW You gonna get a lot more a'that, you  keep me locked up like this! Hm-mm... Hm-mm... Hmmmmmm... Stop-it!... STOP-IT! You like this? Walkin' me through  this field like I's your mule? If I break one you gonna shoot me? Uh-uh. Itches. Uh-uh. I know. I get it. What's Matthew  doin'? Let go of me... GET OFF ME! Why is it you old men gotta talk so  much? Like little boys, gotta talk  yourself into fuckin' me. We can take our time. I'm grown. I  get it. You wanna give me 'nother bath? Goddammit. Hello? Hey! I don't believe this shit. Enough to choke a Goddamn horse. And, sir... do you have a size in  mind for what you're lookin' for? Well, that makes it easier. Well... I hope these will work for  your niece. She can always come back  in and swap sizes. These are whipped body creams. It's  like a lotion. Some women prefer not to scent their  bodies with perfume. So now they  have scented creams. They help  moisturize a woman's skin. This one's my favorite. It's called  Ginger Souffle. I recommend...  applying the cream while the skin is  still damp. So... perhaps just after  a shower. She in the back. Wait right there. You didn't have to do this. Well that's good. I'm happy to hear  it. This was very sweet of you. Oooooo. Hush up. You are my sunshine. My only sunshine.  You make me happy when skies are  gray. You'll never know dear how  much I love you. Please don't take  my sunshine away. A voice from outside  spins her around. The guitar barks  as Rae slams it down on the table. I didn't want to. Thank you. You know how, like they say, you  save someone's life, you responsible  for them. Guess he just don't think  it's safe for me. You a preacher? Can I ask you a question? People always say, you gotta get  good with Jesus, if you want not to  go to hell. That you say sorry for  all you done and... and Jesus would  let you go on to heaven. But that's so fuckin' stupid. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse. You can't hurt people... and then  just say, I'm sorry, and then  everything just gets washed away.  Why would heaven want people like  that. People who... do what they  want and then... switch. Ronnie. Uh-uh. I don't fuckin' cook. Look it... I put the Goddamn dress  on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin'  myself with some... fuckin' restraint  here... how you got me locked up  like a dog on a... I can handle that. Cayenne pepper. Holy shit. Sit down, man. Need a beer? Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here. What? How do you get one of those? Hey, it's alright, man. It's alright. Herman. Come on. He just got back. What happened? I guess it could be worse. You could  be comin' back in a body bag. She's around. Always is. You been home yet? You need a ride? She ever tell you she was thinkin'  of taking off? Drink. Come on, drink some. Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too  close to it. These nervous spells you get. You  never had that shit back in school... You joined up in that monkey troop  cuz you had a plan for yourself.  Army'd pay for school. You were gonna  get a degree, maybe somethin' in  business or agriculture and you were  gonna make somethin' of yourself. And then you had to fall in love  with the school slut. With all she was doin'. With all the  shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck  to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't  let go. YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN The only thing that cunt's had behind  her is me and half the town fuckin'  her. Your first night away, I come over  and drop off the spare keys like you  wanted me to. You weren't gone two  hours and she was aching to get me  inside her. Like she was havin' some  kind'a fit. Don't you think it's funny how I  know where everything in your house  is? I don't care if that hurts you or  not. Truth is I don't know who you  are anymore. So fuck it. You gonna steal my truck? They sure liked them devilled eggs. Sure. Well, that's good news. So you're  gonna be someone's uncle. We drinkin' buddies now? Still makin' jokes? I ain't in a hurry. Could you do somethin' for me? Sing, Lazarus. Please keep singin'. I'm here with you. You can give it to me. You can't start this and not finish.  Not with me. Please... Not gonna lie to you, Laz... This one's a doozy. I don't think...  I don't think I can stop this. The... chain helps. I seen a man die. He couldn't  breathe... his heart was... was givin'  out. He told me... get help. I just stood  there and watched him... I watched  him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT! Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me  so many times. You think God forgives people like  that? You think God forgives people like  me? Hold me. Oh God... Where you gonna be? I'm gonna just get some girl stuff,  like make-up and... stuff. I bet you have loyal customers. Been eatin' like a princess all week.  Even got enough for us to take a  picnic under the gazebo. I put on the lotion you got me. Can  you smell it? Hey. What happened to your face? Got in a little accident. Yeah. Since you workin' on the square now,  maybe we could get some coffee in  the morning, if you want. You need money again? No. That's not why... Why we always gotta do this? I mean,  you and me been at each other as far  back as I can remember. Wasn't no  love between us. And I'm your  daughter. I'm the only family you  got. You never needed nobody. Always made  that clear to me. Yeah. I know I did. But... I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin'  to... get some peace, you know? I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see  that? I just wanted some make-up. All that shit's on aisle 5. I just think you should'a kept him  off me, that's all. The hell are you talkin' about? Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along  with all you say about me. But that...  you can't pretend no more on that.  Cuz I was just a kid, Momma. I didn't know about any of that stuff  he was doin' to me. And you let him do it. Some big nobody  in your life... and you let him do  as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY  you had. I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout... All my life I been puttin' out your  fires, with you givin' out your snatch  to every waggin' dick in this town.  And you gonna lay the blame at my  feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that. But... Momma... just tell me... not  gonna be mad... we can just talk  about it... Be eye to eye on this...  You don't even got to say you're  sorry... Just say how you knew... Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin'  to my parents and having you instead  of doin' what I should'a done. ...tell me you don't know... goddamn SAY IT! JUST FUCKING SAY IT! I's thinkin' about singing in the  choir. Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good  voice or not but... practice is only  on Mondays and Wednesdays, so... When? Now? Oh. No. There is a balm in Gilead to make  the wounded whole. There is a balm in Gilead to save my  sick, sick soul. So. You think I should be in the  choir? What? What is it? This your cousin? You took care of your wife, like you  do me? Nothin'. By myself? Well... Are you drunk? Keep drinkin' water and you won't  get a headache in the mornin'. I guess you have. Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight? I didn't mean it nothin' dirty. I'm gonna pee. I gotta take a break  and go pee. Eat shit and die, Arty. A girl can  change her fuckin' mind. Hey. You don't gotta get up but... I gotta  go... I think if I just piss... I'll be  okay. I'm just in one of my moods. You  know how I get. I think it'd be better if you talk  to me. Just about anything, you know. It  can be funny or... not. Just tell me  somethin'. Are you wasted? Holy shit! Holy shit, Ronnie! You're a fuckin' rock star. All them people shoutin' your name  like they were doing tonight! Shit!  That arm you got'll get'chu on a box  of cereal... Hey? You okay, Ronnie? Is'okay... Is'okay... I feel better. Do you? You... are my... sunshine. Sorry. Don't know where I learn't it, but...  it's there in my head. You know how you feel when you come  out of a bad hangover? Like your  eyes can open a little bit more. Woke up real early. Sun was shining.  Just thought I'd mess around, try to  learn a song. No, you do it. I can't sing. What I love. You make me happy when skies are  gray.  You'll never know dear, how much I  love you.  Please don't take my sunshine away. You are my sunshine. My only sunshine.  You make me happy when skies are  gray. You'll never know dear, how much I  love you.  Please don't take your sunshine away. RONNIE STOP! RONNIE! NO! Ronnie. Please, baby... Ronnie... Oh, baby... just let me... Ronnie? I got you, baby... I got you... What are you doing? You gonna call the cops? You think  they gonna help this? They ever help  you, Laz? Huh? It starts like this... fire... that  spreads. Starts in my head. Then  moves to my stomach. Then it goes  lower. I can stop it sometimes but  mostly I just jump on and ride it  out... then everything'll go back to  normal, you know. Only thing ever  took that feeling away was... was...  when I met Ronnie. Cuz I love him so much. He's all I  got in my life that's special. And I  like taking care of him and helping  him when he gets nervous. When I can  do that for him... it's like I'm  givin' somethin' of myself that I  haven't givin' nobody else. I think... I think we're fucked up.  Both of us. I know I am. But... that  don't mean what I feel ain't true.  It don't mean I can't love. And I  know, how I been is... is... REALLY  BAD! So if you want to quit on me...  I understand. But please... please...  don't. Hey. What do you need? More cough syrup? Laz... you don't need to explain  yourself to me... Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you.  I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well  I can get hurt like this. And I have  been hurt. Just like you. Woman like me, I got a lot of livin'  to do. But my days are precious to  me. They all I got left. Don't want  no more fuss. I want love in my life.  You understanding me, Laz? Now what'chu need me to do? Cuz I'm  gonna go do it. What are you doing? You know the rules. You do know the rules, don't you? Then start taking them seriously. It's okay to breathe, honey. Yes, ma'am. She's ready for you. I've had nice things before but I  always ruined 'em somehow. I want to. More'n anything. But I... Okay. I don't want you to let go. Yes. Yes, sir. You are my sunshine. My only sunshine.  You make me happy, when times are  gray. You'll never know dear, how much I  love you.  Please don't take, my sunshine away. See. We're okay.
