Three times? Oh girl, you are way  pregnant. It's easy to tell. Is your  nipples real brown? Balls! Yo-yo-yiggity-yo. Is this Juno? Only the one in my pants. Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you  have a big lunch? How did you even generate enough pee  for three pregnancy tests? Is this for real? Like for real, for  real? Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand! Well, are you going to go to  Havenbrooke or Women Now for the  abortion? You need a note from your  parents for Havenbrooke. Want me to call for you? I called  for Becky last year. Heavy lifting can only help you at  this point. So, you were bored? Is that how this  blessed miracle came to be? When did you decide you were going  to do Bleeker? Aha! You love him. So, what was it like humping Bleeker's  bony bod? Me too! I love Woody Allen! I have a menstrual migraine, and I  can't look at bright lights today. No Josh, I don't take orders. Not  from you and not from any man. Something happened. Because your  eyes? Are very cold? They're very  cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes. Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato,  they have been lying eyes. I'm going to the infirmary. Fine. Call me when you learn how to  love just one person and not cheat  at your brother's college just because  you had four Smirnoff Ices and a  bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored  Boone's! All babies want to get borned! All  babies want to get borned! What are you doing here, dumbass? I  thought I was supposed to pick you  up at four. Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's  claws could scratch your vag on the  way out? Keep your voice down dude, my mom's  around here somewhere. She doesn't  know we're sexually active. But then you'll get huge. Your chest  is going to milktate. And you have  to tell everyone you're pregnant. Maybe they'll totally shit and be  super mad at you and not let you  graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for  spring break. Well, maybe you could look at one of  those adoption ads. I see them all  the time in the Penny Saver. Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn."  They're right by the ads for like,  iguanas and terriers and used fitness  equipment. It's totally legit. Yeah, but it sucks for free. Look at this one "Wholesome,  spiritually wealthy couple have found  true love with each other." "All that's missing is your bastard." You're not listening to me. What did you have in mind, a family  of disturbed loners who are into  gunplay and incest? All right, how about this one?  "Healthy, educated couple seeking  infant to join our family of five.  You will be compensated. Help us  complete the circle of love." Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one. Paul? Are you coming downstairs to  eat? You ran eight miles today, Puppy. But it's breakfast for supper. Your  favorite, Paulie. I made French toast  and sausage. Patties, not linkies,  just like you like it. Juno MacGuff called while you were  out running. She wants to know if  you're coming to her little  coffeehouse performance on Saturday. You know how I feel about her. I just hope you don't consider her a  close friend. Best to just tell them, man. Rip off  the Band-Aid and let it bleed. I know, right? We found them in the Penny Saver by  the exotic birds section. How does "crap it out" sound? Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno  and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa. Oh no. Thank you. Come on in. Can I take your coats? You found us in the Penny Saver? Nice to meet you. I'll get drinks. What would everyone  like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin  Water... So, Juno. First off, how far along  are you? No, I mean in your pregnancy. Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost  into your second trimester, then? The tough part's almost over for  you. I mean, my girlfriends always  tell me the first couple months are  the hardest. I think pregnancy is beautiful. Mark and Vanessa are willing to  negotiate an open adoption. It means they'd send annual updates,  photos, let Juno know how the baby  is doing as he or she grows up. Of  course, Juno's legal rights would be  terminated... Well, then we agree a traditional  closed adoption would be best for  all involved, then? Are you looking for any other  compensation? You're doing an amazing and selfless  thing for us. I want to be a mommy so badly! Well, haven't you ever felt like you  were born to do something? Well, I was born to be a mother.  Some of us are. Well, shall we start looking over  the paperwork? Gerta has already  drafted some preliminary documents. Sure. The powder room down here is  being re-tiled, but you can use the  master bath upstairs. Go up, then  turn left and on your right... A Pilates machine? You don't make anything. It's for  exercising. Will you excuse me? You guys are playing music? I think Gerta is waiting for us  downstairs with some important stuff  for us to go over. Didn't mean to interrupt the jam  sessions. So, look those over and give me a  call at my office if you have any  questions. Juno, we'd really appreciate it if  you could keep us updated on any  doctor's appointments, ultrasounds,  other things of that nature. So, then, you really think you're  going to go ahead with this? How sure? Percentage-wise, would you  say you're 80% sure, 90% sure? Oh really? All RIGHT! Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is  scary! Touche. Aw, please Junebug? Or stage parents! Mark? Are you home? I want to show  you some things I picked up. Juno! God, you startled me. What are  you doing here? What's wrong? Then what's going on? Is the baby okay? What... Oh my God... Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does. Oh, that's great! Oh it's just some stuff I picked up.  For, you know, the baby. Babies need  a lot of things. I want everything  to be just right. Um, I think people are kind of unsure  about the situation because it's  not, you know, set in stone. No, no, I don't think that, Juno.  It's just that, we went through a  situation before where it didn't  work out. Right. Well, Juno, your parents must  be wondering where you are. You might  want to head home. Hi Juno. What can I do for you? Fine. Come in. Ten minutes. What do you think? Custard or  Cheesecake? Well, I wanted to pick something  gender-neutral for now. Once we get  the baby, God willing, we can create  a more decisive palette. I think I'm leaning toward Custard  in this light. I don't know. I should  paint a small area... What to Expect says that readying  the baby's room is an important  process for women. It's called  "nesting." You should read the book. I even  flagged the "daddy chapters" for  you. And I disagree. That wall is going to need something.  Maybe we could put our first family  picture there. Can you see it? Yum. This pretzel tastes like a  friggin' donut! What? Of the Penny Saver Lorings? No way! She's pretty. I just thought she'd look really old  in real life. And I was like, "No offense, sweetie,  but nobody looks good in gauchos." Especially not with her build. She's gonna steal that kid for her  collection. Bo-ring! God, Spermy. Must you always feed? Juno? Just, you know, shopping with my  girlfriends. You're gay? No... Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling? That's great. Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it? I can't feel anything. It's not moving for me. Hi. Hi, baby. It's me. My name is  Vanessa. I can't wait to meet you. Can you hear me sweet angel? Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it! Wow! It's magical. God, you're getting huge. How many  months has it been now? I wish my funbags would get bigger. Hot! Well, you are kind of... convex. I don't have a choice. Keith's been  grading me really hard lately. Keith's hot. Did you hear Bleek is going to prom  with Katrina De Voort? He asked her. I heard they were going  to Benihana, then the prom, then to  Vijay's parents' cabin. Oh, it totally does. I was there for  her birthday about four years ago  and it was like Lipton Landing. But  you know, boys have endured worse  things for nookie. I wouldn't be so sure about that. He  did it with you. He's a man now. Are you jealous? I thought you said  you didn't care what he did. Okay Juno, I'm really convinced. Juno? What's going on? Mark? Why is Juno crying? Hold on. Juno, what's the matter? What did you do? What? What are you referring to? Of course we're ready. We've taken  all the classes. The nursery. The  books -- Juno, don't worry about this. He  just has cold feet. That's how boys  are. The books all say the same thing.  A woman becomes a mother when she  gets pregnant. A man becomes a father  when he sees his baby. He's going to  get there. He'll get there. Why don't we let Juno go home and we  can discuss this later on, okay? She answered our prayers. What are you saying? What would be a good time for you? Like what? Be a rock star? You're trying to do something that's  never going to happen. And you know  what? Your shirt is stupid. Grow up.  If I have to wait for you to become  Kurt Cobain, I'm never going to be a  mother. No, it's fine. Thanks for making the  call, I guess. We're actually, finally doing this? Have you found a place to stay? A hotel? Aren't you the cool guy? I wanted a baby so bad. So bad. It's for me. You know, you can go into early labor  sucking face like that! What did you say? P. Bleeker has just broken a district  record in the 400. Would you like to meet your son? I have a son? You are the adoptive mother? I have a son. Healthy kid, too. Didn't waste any  time getting out. How do I look?
