Sadie, wake up. Oh my gosh. Daddy, wake up. I need you to take the kids to school this morning. What? Well, you didn't tell me. You didn't tell me. No, you didn't tell me. Well, you didn't, but what are we going to do? Because I have an appointment so you're taking the kids to school. Don't use the baby to cover your tracks. I can drive them. I'll drive them to school. Great. Good. You turned my sister into a limo driver. I don't mind. What are you giggling about? Be quiet. You're starting to annoy me. Poo poo. Ladies. Nice. You know what I did the other day? What? I Googled "murder." You Googled "murder?" Yeah. Why? I mean what did it say? It didn't say anything. It just showed pictures of people lying dead on the floor and...blood everywhere and ugh... That was just ketchup. Who wants to hear some music? I want to hear "Rent." I want to hear Green Day! No, we're listening to "Rent." Well, I want to listen to Green Day. Well, I got your baby! Don't taunt her. Come on. Here. Sadie! Ow! Why did you just do that? Don't throw things at your sister! She hit me. Did you hit her? I did not. Make her happy. It's okay. It won't make her happy. She spilled all the marbles on the floor. Well, give her her marbles back. (into her headset) Okay. Let me check. Hey, guys? (into her headset) Okay, let me know when she's pulling in. (into her headset) Want us to bring you anything? You want some water? You want a cookie? Okay, we'll get you a cookie. Alison? Yeah? Jack and I need to see you in his office. You were talking about me? What'd you decide? They decided that they like you. And they would like to put you on camera. Really? I know. I was so surprised, too. Okay. You know, by, by eating less. We would just like it if you...go home and step on the scale and write down how much you weigh and subtract it by, like, twenty. Twenty. And then weigh that much. Yay! That's so exciting! Yay! Oh my god! Hey! I got a promotion. Thank you. Oh, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Yay! Let's go celebrate. Okay, let's do it. Pete'll watch the kids? What are you going to do? I don't know! I'm so excited. Yay! I walked in on him masturbating one night. Ooh! Did you get the deer-in-the- headlights look? Did he freeze or did he finish? No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't doing anything under the covers. Oh, no! I buy these nice towels and he whacks off into them. "Deb and Pete forever" And once he does that into them once, they're never soft ever again. I can always tell if I'm looking good based on whether or not we get in. Guess we're looking good. If I didn't get in, I would have lost my shit. It's like everyone in here is twelve years old. Am I too old to be here? What? Am I too old to be here? No, of course not. Does it look weird that I'm here? No, not at all. Am I hotter than these little bitches? Yes! You look amazing. Guys in here would fuck me, right? Yes. That's weird to say, but, it makes me feel better. You look hot. I believe you. I'm getting us drinks. (to the Bartender) Oh, Hey! Excuse me! Yeah, awesome. Yeah, that was rough. Great. It's going to be that night. Yeah. Thank you. Are you sure? Thanks a lot, Oh, fuck, fuck! I'm supposed to get one for my sister. No, that's okay. I'll wait. I'll, he'll get me-- Thank you. Awesome. I'm Alison. Well, have a great night. Thanks for the beer. Bye. Thanks again. Hey. This is my sister, Debbie. Hi, Ben? Nice to meet you. Good, how are you? She's married. Why do you have to say that? What? Thank you. She has two kids, too. Shut up! What? It's nothing to be ashamed of. Really? Excuse me. (into the phone) Hello? Yeah, she's got a really cool phone. (into the phone) What? Is it a rash or is it the chicken pox? I don't know! Google it. Okay. All right, bye. (to Alison et al) I got to go. Sadie might have the chicken pox. Are you coming? Um, uh, you know, I'm all dressed, so I'll just hang out. Really? Yeah, I'll take a cab home. Be safe. I will. Bye. Cheers. No, no. You know, the like, Entertainment News channel? I love your curly hair! It's so great. Do you, like, use product or anything? You put anything in it? Yeah, let's go. We can go hang out at my place? I'll show you my audition tape. It's really funny. Shh! No. Do you have a condom? Okay. Okay. Hurry up. What are you doing? Oh, God, just do it already! Yeah, it's awesome. Okay, just stop taking. Hi. Hey. Yeah. Yes. Seven-thirty. I have to go to work. Do you need to get to work or anything? Okay. `Morning. Stop it. See ya later. I'm gonna do it. No. I'm gonna give you my card because that'll be the best way... All right then. Nice to meet you. Take care. Hi, I'm Alison Scott and we're here today with James Franco from "Spider Man." How are you? Thanks for coming. Tell me, were you a big fan... ...I'm sorry, let me take that again. Tell me, were you a big fan of the comic books growing up? Uh-huh. Yeah, just, what about the comic books? Keep talking. Shut up. You're an asshole. I don't need to see it again. It's gonna make me throw up. You're such an asshole. Yeah, maybe if you can just edit this out and we can re-- --we can reshoot my questions. Oh my god. Oh my god. I don't know. I haven't eaten today yet. Do you have a napkin or something? I don't know. It's impossible. You have to have sex to get pregnant. Oh, shit. No, I can't be pregnant. Right? That was what, eight weeks ago? Did you miss your period? No. Wait. I don't know. Shit. I don't know. I can't remember. I was, I mean, I've been really stressed at work. I can't remember my last period. Are you the lady who doesn't realize she's pregnant until she's sitting on the toilet and a kid pops out? Can you not joke right now? Don't joke right now. This is really serious. Did I meet him? Yeah. You know, he was kind of like medium height, sort of...chubby. Blonde, curly hair. Remember? With the man boobs. Yes! Here, I have this thing of him on my phone. Oh god. How did this happen? Oh, shit. Well there's only one way to find out. They're here! Here they are! Over here! Okay. "Positive Choice." "Easy, One, Two, Three." Here. Hurry up now. Come on. Get more! Get me a few more! Did you try the "Ova-Sure?" I'm dripping, I'm dripping. Wait. Good! A smiley face! Oh, I think that's bad. How long does this one take? These can't all be positive. Let me try one. God, you really had to pee. What is this? What the hell is this? I think you picked up the wrong one. Fuck. That scared me. That would suck. I'm sorry. That scared me. It's gonna be fine. Right? ALISON (CONT'D) (cont'd) Right? Of course it will be fine. It's gonna be fine. Shit. You just need to call him. Maybe I don't need to call him until after I see the doctor. You need to call. I don't want to call him. I don't need to call him. You should call. I can't call him anyway. He doesn't even have a phone. He didn't even have a number to give me. He doesn't have a phone? Said some kind of billing issue. He can't afford a phone? Sadie has a phone. Shit, you're right. I got to call. I don't know. I'm gonna have to look him up on his stupid website. What kind of website does he have? He spelling "coming" wrong. Oh it's "cum." That's gross. Just go to "Contact Us." Ben? Yeah. "What is your number? I need to speak with you right away." Send? Yep. You're sure? Yeah. (into the phone) Hi, Ben, this is Alison. I don't know if you remember me. (into the phone) I actually was just wondering if maybe you, wanted to get together, like tomorrow night? (into the phone) Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night? You wanna just grab some dinner? (into the phone) Sure. That's cool. Can we make it more like six, though? I'd like to keep it early. (into the phone) Okay. I'll just meet you there, then, at six. Oh, shit. It's really nice. I am going to the doctor next week...and I thought you could come with me to the gynecologist. No. Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure. Yeah, yeah. Come on. Yes. Alison. Good. I took a home pregnancy test and it said I was pregnant, so here we are. That, that's it? Alison, just take care of it. Take care of it. Move on. What's gonna happen with your career? Or how, how are you gonna tell them? Well, I'm not gonna tell them for a while. I have a while before I have to say anything. How could you not tell them? Well, they're not gonna know. I mean, I'm only gonna start to show when I'm like, I don't know, six months or something. Seven months. Three months. No. Three months. Fat in the face, jowls, fast ass. Debbie didn't get fat. Debbie is a freak of nature. Mom, you know, it's important to me that you be supportive. I cannot be supportive of this. This is a mistake. This is a big, big mistake. Now think about your stepsister. Now, you remember what happened with her? She had the same situation as you and she had it taken care of. And you know what? Now she has a real baby. Honey, this is not the time. Hi, Ben? Good, good. You know, I was just calling to, let you know that, I've decided to keep the baby.That's what's happening with that. Yeah, yeah, it is good. I really appreciate you saying that. I have no idea either. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Hi. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. She's good. Okay. Hi. Hi. No. Eh, no. I'm good. Hi. Hi. I'm Jodi. Yeah, hi. I heard you were pregnant. Mm-hm. Oh, aren't you scared? The way it's gonna come out of your...It's gonna hurt a lot I bet. Your vagina...That's so sick. I don't know. Are you hungry? I'm okay right now. Thank you. You must be angry at the baby whenever it steals your food, huh? "Oh it's mine, not yours." But, you know... Because you're family, you got to share. Right. The funny thing is I really had never even thought about having a baby. If this hadn't happened, I don't think I would have wanted to have a baby for, like, I don't know, at least ten years. It's a beautiful picture, Ben. With a little hint of Spanish. Awesome. What can we expect? It sounds thrilling. Yeah, thank you. Ugh. Sounds awful. I'm just really constipated. Do you really want to? Shut up. We have to help her. We'll help her raise the baby. It's not that. Okay, first of all, it's not my situation. It's our situation. And just because I'm pregnant, I'm not some ruined woman and all romance goes out the door. I like you, too. A little, so far. I mean, we have seven months before the baby comes. We don't have to rush it. We should really just try to get to know each other and...give this a real shot. You know? We got ourselves into this situation. We kind of have to. Exactly. Okay, if this was our second date, what would you do? You know what? For the sake of getting to know one another, can you not talk like that? I'm nervous, too. I'm really nervous. You're a sweet guy, right? Don't fuck me over, okay? Okay. Who's he? He's my boyfriend. I never met him before. He's a new boyfriend. So he came over for breakfast because he's your new boyfriend? He came from his house, drove over to our house because he thought it would be fun to have breakfast with us, so he drove his car from his house to our house to have breakfast. I love breakfast. What? Well, you're not married. Aren't you supposed to be married to have a baby? But they should be because they love each other and people who love each other get married and have babies. Where do babies come from? Where do you think they come from? Well, I think a stork, he drops it down, and then, a hole goes in your body and there's blood everywhere, coming out of your head, and then you push your belly-button, and then your butt falls off and then you hold you butt and you have to dig and you find a little baby. That's exactly right. Feed the teddy bear. What do you think of him? He's funny, right? He's playing fetch with my kids. He's treating my kids like they're dogs. No's he not. Plays fetch with the kids. He's trying. He's making an effort. I don't wanna play this anymore. He's overweight. Where does that end? How old is he? Twenty-three. Looks thirty-three. He can barely get in and out of that little house. Imagine how much bigger he's going to get. That means he has bad genes. Your kid is going to be overweight. Shit. Just give him a break. Okay, I'll try. No. I have on occasion. How ya doing? No. Hey, you wanna trade boyfriends? Just kidding. Kind of. Wow. That is not your vagina. That's your asshole. That happens about five times a day. Boobs! Boobs! Boobs! Boobs and bush. Good boobs. Right over the beginning credits. I know. That's so crazy. How many doctors are there in your practice? Just because I'm sort of looking for a more personal experience. I want to make sure that you're my doctor on the day and... I feel really good about this. I think we found our doctor. Yeah. You're being dramatic. We didn't meet that many. Pardon? The doughnuts, they call to me. Hey, Alison! Hi. Great job. Thanks. For you. What? Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you think they're gonna be mad? I'm really chickening out about this. Awesome. Just don't say anything, okay? Please don't say anything. Ooh. Did you see this sex offender website? These are all the sex offenders in our neighborhood. Those are sex offenders. These people live in our neighborhood. You shouldn't take it so lightly. If I didn't care about these things, you wouldn't care about anything. Care more. I know we're supposed to be nice with each other right now, but I'm having a really hard time. I'm struggling with it right now. Because I want to rip your fucking head off because you're so fucking stupid! This is scary. These are our children. You fucking dipshit! So I'm the bad guy because I'm trying to protect our kids from child molesters and mercury? And you're cool because you don't give a shit? Yeah? Is that it? God, you're an asshole. I don't give a shit about Ben. Okay, come on! Let's go. It's Saturday. You don't want to know the sex of the baby? That's no fun. Ben knows, but I've sworn him to secrecy. I'll get it out of him. We are that happy. Which is awesome. Because I never like guys like you. It's great. This is it. This is perfect. We can just borrow yours. Is that okay? No. You need your own crib. You know what? Let me buy it. I need to get you a baby present anyway, and I would love to get it for you. No. I'm serious. I want to. No. It's too much. Right. It's so hot in the Valley. Hey! Oh, my God! Oh, shit. Alison! All right. Wow. I love you too. But here's the thing. I don't really know yet what that love means. It's so new and it's so exciting. It's great. I don't know. We've only known each other for seventeen weeks. I'm okay with that. We're just doing what we can. I don't want us to put any more pressure on ourselves than we have. I didn't hurt your feelings, did I? I really do love you. Ben proposed to me. He did. It was really sweet. I feel a little bad. He was wearing this great button-down. He tucked it in. He got down on one knee. He didn't have an actual ring, though, just an empty box but he had this whole spiel about when he has the money, he'll buy me the ring I deserve. The box was empty? He can't afford a ring. So he got down on one knee and gave you an empty box? Yes. I'm sorry. Get over it. If you'd been there, you would have cried. You need to train him. Oprah said that when two people meet they should point out each other's differences and flaws. I thought you should love people for who they are. You criticize them a lot, so they get so down on themselves they have to change. You don't think that's naggy? In the end, they thank you for it. You can't commit to him. You don't even know him. I don't even know Pete after ten years. I don't know what he's up to. He's miserable. Why do you say that? I think he's cheating on me. He's always going to business meetings at odd hours. Then I try to call him on his cell phone and he says he's in bad cell phone reception areas when he's in good reception areas. Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's trying to sign a new band. I can't imagine Pete doing that. There's no part of you that thinks maybe he's a dirty little scumbag? No. I think he might be. "Memory Spy Web Memory Software. Locate history, files, websites visited, hidden downloads, e-mail history. Memory Spy." Let's see you hide from me now, little man. No. I don't have to. It's illegal for them to fire me over it. And I get three months maternity leave if I stay. So I'm not going to tell them. Good plan. What changed for you? What went out the window? You do everything exactly the same. You want to go to India? Go to India! Seriously. No. You can go. What do you mean? No. What are you talking about? I don't know who Doc Brown is. What are you talking about? I have a really good idea. Why don't you two get in your time machine, go back in time and fuck each other? Come on, harder. Why? Just do it deeper. Why? Just do it! The doctor and Debbie said it's fine. Come on! That's ridiculous! Millions of people have sex when they're pregnant! It just works! Just get over it. Trust me, you're not even close. Okay, fine. I can't do this. I can't focus like this. I look disgusting from this angle. I can feel you looking at my chins. And my boobs are all like, squishy and they're flopping around. I can feel it and it's distracting. It's all National Geographic. No. I do not want you to fuck me like a dog. Yeah. Harder. Just go harder. Keep going! What happened? It always kicks. It's fine. Just keep going. It's fine! It's fine! What are you talking about? I have totally lost it now. I've lost it. Great, you know what? Just forget it. (holding back tears) Don't worry. I won't make you do this again. Ben? Ben! What happened? Where were you? Yeah, because you were getting high off your huge bong. How am I supposed to be comfortable with the idea that you can take care of me and the baby if you are always getting high? What is this? Hey it's me. Hi! So, listen. Will you do me a big favor? Debbie wants us to come over and have dinner tonight. She thinks Pete is cheating on her. Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails and there's an address. Ugh. Ben, come on. How do you know? Are you sure? Are you really? Why? Well, why don't you just come over then, and, we'll just diffuse the situation a little? Okay. Have fun. No. I don't think so. Why was the door unlocked? Wait here. What? Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating. Stop it. There's nobody up there. I guess I was wrong. Yeah, come on. Let's go. Did you hear that? What? Come on. What is this? What the fuck is this? Your fantasy what? Well, what did you do last Wednesday night when you said you went to see a band? With who? What'd you see? Why do you want to go by yourself? Why didn't you ask me to go? I need time for myself. I want time for myself, too. You're not the only one. I like Spiderman. I don't want to go see it now. I don't want to have to ask you to ask me. I want you to just come up with it on your own. You just think because you don't yell that you're not mean, but this is mean. No, you're not. You're lying. You know what? I don't want you at the house anymore. Okay? I cannot stop thinking about what an asshole Pete is. Really? Because that had to be one of the most selfish things I've ever witnessed. What's funny about it? I've had to sacrifice my job, my body, my youth, my vagina! Yes! It will never look the same after this! You can't pay for shit! You can barely buy spaghetti. You know what? Get out of the car. You should just get out of the fucking car. Get out of the car. I own this car! Get out of my car! Get out of my car! Get out of my fucking car! You know what? Maybe I should take my shoes off. Or my belt buckle. My belt buckle's huge. Are you fucking kidding me? Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am hormonal, I am terrified, and I am falling apart, so stop treating everything like it's a big joke! Well, don't! Okay?! You can't take anything seriously! You didn't even read the baby books. It just shows your lack of commitment, Ben! That you're not in this with me! If you feel that way, you should just go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't mean to do this together, okay? And, and we tried to make it work and that was good, I suppose. But it doesn't work. Because we are two completely different people. And I think it would just be easier for both of us if we stop fooling ourselves. Nice. You are such an asshole. You know what? Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck! I'm really sorry about all that. That was really inappropriate. I don't feel so stupid, then. Get up. What? We're not going to do this. Seriously. What are you doing? We have to do something! And have fun! I'm just so tired. I know you're tired. But we're going to be untired! We're going to go live! Ugh. I hate you so much sometimes. We're going to be positive. How many Red Bulls have you had? I've had about three Red Bulls in the last fifteen minutes. And I feel fabulous! We're going to create a new life and it's going to be awesome! Let's go! Hi. Really? Oh, come on. We come here all the time. It's not a big deal. It doesn't really look that crowded in there. Please? What was that? What the fuck was that? You know what? Maybe we should just go. You don't need to call me sweetie. No, you don't need to call me sweetie. I'm not going to go to the end of the fucking line. Who the fuck are you? I have just as much of a right to be here as any of these little skanky girls! What, am I not skanky enough for you?! You want me to hike up my fucking skirt?! What the fuck is your problem?! I'm not going anywhere! You're just some `roided out freak with a fucking clipboard. And your stupid little fucking rope! You may have power now, but you're not God. You're a doorman! Okay? You're a doorman! So...fuck you, you fucking fag with your fucking little faggy gloves. What? Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry. Oh, God. Ugh. It's over. What's over? My youth. Don't say that. It's true. I just want to dance. I love dancing. So dance. I can't dance. I'm embarrassed. I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking whale and I'm trying to get into some stupid club and-- You look beautiful. You're young and you're tall and you got the good lips and boobs. I'm going to be alone. Debbie, no, you're not. Yes, I am. Oh, God! Fucking, men! I get worse looking and he gets better looking, and it's so fucking unfair. Oh, fuck. We should go. My babysitter always gets mad when we come home past twelve. She's such a pissy little high- school cunt. Everything looks beautiful. Thanks. I went kind of overboard, huh? No, it's great. Your daughter only turns eight once. Is Ben going to come? I don't think so. I don't know why he would. Where have you been? Why is everybody so mad at you? They've been saying, like "blah-blah- blah-blah. Ben's a prick." A lot. What does it mean? Oh. Penis. Hey, Ben. How are you? Hi. Did you just get pink cupcakes or yellow and pink cupcakes? I thought I said to get pink cupcakes. Nah, it's no big deal. No it doesn't matter. Yeah. You look really cute in that. I just don't think we can make it work. You're just being nice. And I'm being nice and just because we're two nice people doesn't mean we should stay together. I don't want this baby to determine the rest of our lives. You know? Me not wanting to do this alone isn't enough of a reason to drag you into a relationship with me. It's just not fair. And, and don't repeat this, but, God, I don't want to end up like Debbie. She's happy today. But every day is a constant struggle for them because they're not right for each other. You know? And they have to force it and I don't want us to have to do that. I don't want to force you to be what I think you should be. That's wrong of me because you're great. You really are. You're great the way you are and, I mean, you like to get high and you like to do shrooms in Vegas. And who am I to stop you? Who am I to tell you that that's wrong? It's not wrong. It's who you are. It's what you enjoy and that's your life and... We can be friends. And you can be there when the baby is born, and in the baby's life as much as you want. I hope you will be. Excuse me? Can you grab the video camera? We're going to sing "Happy Birthday" now. Yeah. I'm sorry. I got to go. I'm sorry. I'll be right back. We'll finish talking. When are you due? I got two months. Really? Wow. Well, you're so big already. Yeah. I got two months to go. Wow, wow. You look fantastic. Thanks, thanks. Are you going to, like, give birth right now? You know what? You don't need to lie to me. I don't appreciate it. I know I look like a fat cow. And I'm sweating profusely. Steve, hey! Help me out. Give me an interview, please. You know what? Just say into the camera, "You're watching E! Entertainment." Just give me that. No, Steve, don't be an asshole! Come on. Shut up, Brent. I'm really sorry. This is Hollywood. We don't like liars. I just wasn't expecting this and, I didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't want to lose my job. I'm really sorry. Okay. I won't. I'm sorry. I just don't like secrets. Shut up, Pete. Legoland! Don't get them all riled up before the drive. We'll be back on Sunday. Sunday. Let's go. Ow, ow, ow. Okay, okay, okay. (into the phone) Hi, Dr. Howard? I'm a patient of Dr. Howard's and I'm going into labor and I need to speak with him. Can you help me find him? Can you give me his number? No, no, no, no. I want to speak to my own doctor. You really won't give me his number? Because this is my first baby and he promised that he would be here for me and I need you to give me his number, okay? No, I don't want you to help me because I have no idea who you are! I want my own goddamned doctor! You make sure he calls me! Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, shit. Ben? Shh! Just relax, okay? Just be mellow, because that's what this is all about. Because if it gets too stressful in here then the baby is born into a stressful environment and then he's wired for stress for the rest of his life. So just...just be calm. I don't want to talk about it. No. I don't want to go there. Don't go there, okay? Help me stay relaxed. You need to call Dr. Howard. Hello? He's at San Francisco at Bar Mitzvah. In three days. Great. Thank you so much. I'm so glad you're here. Thank you. No, it's okay. We're past it. I'm sorry I told you to fuck your bong. Let's just drop it now. We're over it. Hey. Did you talk to him? Thank you. Wait. Are we allowed to park here? Oh. That was really sweet of you. He did. We'll take good care of you. Samuel? This is Alison Scott. Please admit her into room 307. Is that the baby on that one right there? Okay. Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this naturally. I don't want to use drugs. Oh, yeah, get in there. What was that? Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby to be born all drugged out. It's not my birth plan. What? No. But no, I'm not comfortable with that. I'm not. Whatever. Do what you have to do. (whispering to Ben) Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy is. I'm so sorry I broke up with you. I was just in such a panic from all of this. And watching Debbie and Pete together, and my ass got so fat. It did. I just never, for one minute, thought that the guy who got me pregnant would actually be the right guy for me. I guess he is. Hi. I can't believe I go out of town and this happens. I know. I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere. Screw Legoland. No, you can shoot the waiting room. That would be great. Well, thank you. I've got it from here. Debbie. Why? Okay. I understand how you feel, but this isn't up to you. He just kicked me out. He told me to leave. But I guess it's good, right? He said he's going to take care of her. He really seems on his game. I think he's going to be a good dad. I think I like him. Thank God. Go! Holy shit, almighty! Oh, shit, this really hurts! I want the epidural! Okay? Give me the epidural! Okay? No, seriously, I want an epidural! I know there's time! Take the time! I'll make sure it doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing. I'll stop, oh, please, please, please! Okay. I feel everything! Oh, my God! It's happening. Are you fucking kidding me? Are you kidding me? Yeah. That's what it sounds like for everyone. Everyone goes through this. Oh, God. Honey, what does it look like, Ben? What? No, I want to see it! No, I want to see... ...it! Oh, God! Oh, God! Get out! Hey. Oh, God! Oh, Ben. I did it. It's out. Hi, baby. I love you, Ben. Thank you. Pretty baby. (whispering to Pete) Who is that? Is that Ben's rabbi? Is he the one who cuts the penis? Oh, my God. Hello. My goodness. She's beautiful. She's beautiful. I love you, Ben. We're going to have another baby. Hello, baby. I hope your apartment's big enough for the three of us. Well, I look good in red. Yeah. Good choice. I would yell at you about driving so slow, except the baby's here.
