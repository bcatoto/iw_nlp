Hark! The brave Prince Charming approach-ith. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 2. Woooo hoooo!!! Good morning. Oh... morning breath... Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 5. Okay. You have a very full day filling in for the King and Queen. There are several functions that require your attendance, sir. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 6. Ow! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 8. Yeah, wow. Uh, is this really necessary? Okay peoples! This isn't a rehearsal. Let's see some hustle. I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please just try to grin and bear it? It's just until Dad gets better. Shrek? You look handsome. Uh Shrek? Shrek... SHREK! What are you doing? Yeah. I'm fine. Honey, please calm down... Some people just don't understand boundaries. Just think... a couple more days, and we'll be back home in our vermin-filled shack, strewn with fungus, filled with the rotting stench of mud and neglect. And, uh... maybe even the pitter- patter of little feet on the floor...? Uh, no... you know, what I was thinking of is a little bit bigger than a swamp rat. No, Shrek. Um... what if - They were little ogre feet? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 14. Shrek. Don't you ever think about having a family? Harold. Of course darling. Yes Daddy? It's okay. The Frog King is dead. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 16. Daddy! Harold!? She's not welcome here and neither are you. What do you want, Charming? It's out of my hands senorita, the winds of fate have blown on my destiny. But I will never forget you. You are the love of my life. As are you... And you. And, uh... hi. I don't know you, but I'd like to. I gotta go. Shrek, maybe you should just stay and be King. It's not that. No. It's, you see... It's not going to be just you and me. Awwwwwwwww! Shrek! Wait! I'm, I'm- No... No, I said I'm pr- Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 26. I said I'm pregnant! You're going to be a father! Really? I'm glad you think so! I love you. Oh, and you my friend are royally-- Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 27. Allow me to explain. You see, when a man has certain feelings for a woman, a powerful urge sweeps over him... You know I love Fiona, Boss. Right? But what I'm talking about here is you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice- cold pitcher of mojitos, and two weeks of nothing but fishing. Ready?! Okay! Where for art thou headed, to the top? Yeah we think so, we think so! And dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped? Nay we thinks not! We thinks not! Ahhhhh! But how did you receive the wedgies when you are clearly not the wearer of the underpants? Eh, totally. Yeah, totally! That information is on a need to know basis. If it were real could I do this? Oh! Wow! Just precious! Look at her! So, have you had any cravings since you've been pregnant? No, no, not at all. Do you smell ham? Oh, Fiona, won't you please open mine first? It's the one in front. "Congratulations on your new mess maker..." Oh, `mess maker.' "Hopefully this helps. Love, Cinderella." Oooo! Aaaah! Will you look at that! What is it? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 45. It's for the poopies. Eww. Wait, babies poop? Everyone poops Beauty. Oooh. Oh, you guys, that's so sweet. Thank you. Who's this one from? (reading the card) "Have one on me, love Snow White" Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 46. Umm... what is it? Where's the baby? You're too kind, Snow, but I can't accept this. What does he do? The cleaning. The burping. So what are Shrek and I supposed to do? Well, now you'll have plenty of time to work on your marriage. Gee thanks Rapunzel, and what's that supposed to mean? Oh, come on now, Fiona. You know what happens. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 47. Huh? You're tired all the time... Say goodbye to romance. Um sorry... but how many of you have kids? She's right. A baby is only gonna strengthen the love that Shrek and Fiona have. How did Shrek react when you told him? Tell me! Well, when he first found out...Shrek said- His name's not Peter! Ahhh! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 49. Everyone in! Now. We don't have time. Now go! Quickly ladies! And fortunately you'll have the royal food tasters. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 56. They taste the food before the King eats, to make sure it's not poisoned. All of them, willing at a moment's notice to lay down their own lives out of devotion to you. Si, and the whole kingdom will look to you for wisdom and guidance. Or plague. The coughing, the groaning, the festering sores. What did I say? How humiliating... Uh boss, I don't think he's coming back and maybe it's for the best. He is not exactly king material. Oh this place is filthy. I feel like a hobo. Everything's always about you, isn't it? It's not like your attitude is helping, Snow. You mean in that rigged election? Ladies, let go of your petty complaints and let's work together. No, we're gonna get inside and find out what Charming's up to. I know he's a jerk and everything, but I gotta admit, that Charming makes me hotter than July. Ew! Ugh. That's it! Come on, this way! Rapunzel. Wait! Charming, let go of her. Grrrr! What? Yaaaaaaaaay! Rapunzel, how could you? Jealous much? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 72. But Pooky, you promised you wouldn't hurt them! Shrek will be back soon Charming, and you'll be sorry. We've got to save her! (in Donkey's body) At least you don't look like some kind of bloated roadside piï¿½ata. You really should think about going on a diet!
