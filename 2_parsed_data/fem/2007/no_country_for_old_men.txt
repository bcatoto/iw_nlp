What's in the satchel? That'll be the day. ...Where'd you get the pistol? Did you buy that gun? Llewelyn! What'd you give for that thing? I need to know that. Big talk. Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day. Llewelyn. What're you doin', baby? Goin' where? What're you goin' to do? Your mother's dead, Llewelyn. Llewelyn? What the hell? Why would we go to Odessa? Well -- how come? So... for how long do we have to... What'm I supposed to tell Mama? Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing. I thought it was a car afire. It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too. When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse. Hyah! ...I love you more'n more, ever day. That's very nice. ...Be careful. I always am. Don't get hurt. I never do. Don't hurt no one. Well. If you say so. You wouldn't think a car would burn like that. Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell? I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind. Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what. Well. Old age flattens a man. Uh-huh. ...You ride Winston. Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything happens to Loretta's horse I can tell you right now you don't wanna be the party that was aboard. It's the same tire tread comin back as goin'. Made about the same time. You can see the sipes real clear. I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss. That's the boy. I don't know but I kindly doubt it. Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two. Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's. ...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun. I don't know... ...Supposedly they won't eat a Mexican. That Mexican brown dope. That's possible. No. Probably I don't. If it ain't it'll do til a mess gets here. Yessir? Did you go up to his trailer? Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message? I can't say. Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents. Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information. Why all the way to Del Rio? You can't afford one? Promise? I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn. Mama's gonna raise hell. She is just gonna cuss you up'n down. I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart. Llewelyn? You are comin back, ain't ya? Look at the lock. Gun out and up. I'm hidin' behind you. No reason not to stay safe. Believe you're right. Probably must be. I don't know. Oh. ...Now that's aggravating. Still sweating. Well, okay... ...What do we circulate? ...Lookin' for a man who has recently drunk milk? I'm ahead of you there. I don't know. He ought to... ...He seen the same things I seen and it made an impression on me. You tell me the option. The option. ...You pick the option with the applicable rate. Hello? Llewelyn?! No he ain't. Now why would I expect him? Who is this? What was the bullet? Wasn't no bullet? Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense. You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound. Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife? Well I don't either! Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you. I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there? Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast. You want to change rooms? Another additional. Yeah we had a sorta one. You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty. It ain't took. That's got two double beds. Anything on those vehicles yet? No. Lord no. ...This month's checks. That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him? I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can. He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him. Well that's cordial of him. I guess he can go wherever he wants. He's a certified agent of the United States Government. ...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss. Yes Sheriff. I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might. You want me to wait til you've quit the building? Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary. ...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice? We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that. I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over... ...What the hell? Have you looked at your load lately? That's a damned outrage. How many did you leave with? Couldn't you all of took a van out there? You get your ass out of here. Carla Jean, I thank you for comin'. Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is. You ain't heard from him? No I ain't. Nothin'? Not word one. Would you tell me if you had? Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you. It's not me he's in trouble with. Who's he in trouble with then? Some pretty bad people. Llewelyn can take care of hisself. These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit. He won't neither. He never has. I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is. He can take all comers. You know Charlie Walser? Has the place east of Sanderson? ...Well you know how they used to slaughter beeves, hit 'em with a maul right here to stun 'em... ...and then truss 'em up and slit their throats? Well here Charlie has one trussed up and all set to drain him and the beef comes to. It starts thrashing around, six hundred pounds of very pissed-off livestock if you'll pardon my... Charlie grabs his gun there to shoot the damn thing in the head but what with the swingin' and twistin' it's a glance-shot and ricochets around and comes back hits Charlie in the shoulder. You go see Charlie, he still can't reach up with his right hand for his hat... Point bein', even in the contest between man and cow the issue is not certain. ...When Llewelyn calls, just tell him I can make him safe. ...Course, they slaughter beeves different now. Use a air gun. Shoots out a rod, about this far into the brain... ...Sucks back in. Animal never knows what hit him. Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff? I don't know. My mind wanders. The motel in Del Rio? There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when. Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock? Okay. No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes. Natural to the line of work they was in. My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know... ...Here last week they found this couple out in California they would rent out rooms to old people and then kill em and bury em in the yard and cash their social security checks. They'd torture em first, I don't know why. Maybe their television set was broke. And this went on until, and here I quote... ..."Neighbors were alerted when a man ran from the premises wearing only a dog collar." You can't make up such a thing as that. I dare you to even try. ...But that's what it took, you'll notice. Get someone's attention. Diggin graves in the back yard didn't bring any. ...That's all right. I laugh myself sometimes. ...There ain't a whole lot else you can do. Llewelyn? What should I do? And I always seen this is what it would come to. Three years ago I pre- visioned it. It ain't even three years we been married. Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good. Now here we are. Ninety degree heat. I got the cancer. And look at this. Not even a home to go to. We're goin' to El Paso Texas. You know how many people I know in El Paso Texas? That's how many. Ninety degree heat. I got it Mama. I didn't see my Prednizone. I put it in, Mama. Well I didn't see it. Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags. Well thank god there's one gentleman left in West Texas. Yes thank you. I am old and I am not well. We're going to El Paso, don't ask me why. Discombobulated by a no-account son-in-law. Thank you. You don't often see a Mexican in a suit. Sheriff, was that a true story about Charlie Walser? Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story. Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'? Yes ma'am? If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else? Yes ma'am, I do. Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any. Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not. Hey Mr. Sporting Goods. You a sport? I got beers in my room. Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for? What else then? Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married. I do like you. ...Beer. That's what's comin', I'll bring the ice chest out here. You can stay married. Beer leads to more beer. Call police. ...Call your local law enforcement. I'm not on their radio. Carla Jean... No. I don't know who she is. No ID in her room? No money in his room there? I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry. Yes. Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow. Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more. ...I don't know what I do feel like. Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell. Uh-huh. I'm not sure he's a lunatic. I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost. Oh yes. Yes, he has some hard bark on him. Hard to believe. How'd you know I was here. You heard it? You heard my -- you havin' fun with me? But -- how'd you know it was mine? How many a those things you got now? How you been, Ellis? I am older. Didn't know there was any. Want a cup? How fresh is this coffee? That man that shot you died in prison. What would you a done if he'd been released? I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that. Yes, you've circled round. I don't know. I feel overmatched. ...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does. Yes I do. When did he die? No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it. Most don't. I'm... discouraged. I knew this wasn't done with. I ain't got the money. What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither. ...I need to sit down. ...You got no cause to hurt me. You gave your word? That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me? Not like that. Not like you say. I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me. Maybe I'll go ridin. Okay. What do you think. I can't plan your day. I mean, would you care to join me. Lord no. I'm not retired. Maybe I'll help here then. Better not. ...How'd you sleep? I don't know. Had dreams. Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting? Well they always is to the party concerned. Ed Tom, I'll be polite. Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
