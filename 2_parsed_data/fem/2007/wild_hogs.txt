I've got some stuff to do for the party tomorrow. Can you take Billy to school? It's a our 10th anniversary, Doug. Its going to be a nice party with nice food and nice music. And wings have carbs, so you can't eat them anyway. Doug, can you take Billy or not? You have emergencies? Are you kidding me!? You work in our guest bedroom, not an office. Yeah, and I have to go to a job that actually makes us money, Bob. So, get out here and tell Haley she's not going anywhere! Bob nods obediently and hurries out of the room. Hey, Daddy. Listen. (screams at the top of her No!! Don't touch that! It's Julien! Haley snatches the phone away from Bob. Hey, Julien. Yeah, totally. I'll probably just drop by and chill. Dad! I'm talking, here. God! Haley storms out of the room. Bob goes to say something, but CLAIRE enters and looks up at him. Eeeeeeeiiiiiaaaaa!! Bob just stares at her, as Karen enters the Kitchen. (yelling above Claire) Did you talk to her? Tell me you talked to her. God! I have to do everything! Just get Claire to ballet. She's late. Your little article for the "Web" magazine, Bob?

You might not like it, but my job is higher paying. And I don't see you complaining about that hundred dollar shirt you're wearing. Bob looks down at his too-hip dress shirt. Oh, you don't like the shirt now? Fine. Take it off. Take it off! You don't want to wear nice things, don't. Off! Bob sighs and takes the shirt off. Karen snatches it from him. Now take Claire to her ballet class. It's starts in five minutes. Go! Five minutes! Karen pushes Bob out the door, with Claire skipping happily behind him. For five dollars, I'm not. Bob sighs and reaches for his wallet. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 7. Woody Stevens! We see WOODY STEVENS, 40s, handsome, but with shifty eyes and a Michael Keaton hairline, walk through the stylish house speaking into a cordless headset. You busy? Don't they mind you being on the phone? Oh. Well, I just wanted to tell you I found a great rate for the Ritz-Carlton tomorrow night. I Thought it might be romantic. Mom can stay here with Billy. Doctor Matthews. Finally. Take a look at this. Doug looks in the man's mouth and nods. That's what I thought. Thank God you got here. Absolutely. Thanks, doctor. Doug nods. He looks around for something else to do, but there's nothing. He moves a dental tool away from the edge of a tray, smiles politely and exits. Hey, honey. Snack? Kelly hands Doug a sandwich bag of celery. He looks over to the table, where Kelly has laid out Ritz crackers covered in cheez whiz, for the kids. Doug puts the bag of celery down. Okay. Lite beer, if you want to stick to that diet. Hey, sweetie. Having fun? It's eight O'Clock. It started at seven. People are having fun. Look at the Miltons. ANGLE ON: THE LIVING ROOM. A happy-looking couple, THE MILTONS, are dancing around to Prince's "1999." Doug  laughs. No, Fred's having a good time. With his  wife. Remember what that was like? I don't care. Why do you?  Doug searches for a response, as ROGER, 70, Kelly's Dad,  clinks his wine glass at the front of the room. Doug, stop it. You're being rude. You're not the same, Doug. The old Doug wouldn't have made fun of Fred Milton for dancing, because he would have been out there dancing himself. With me. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 24. I'm saying you have changed. And frankly, i don't like it. I like you the way you were. I liked it when you weren't afraid of looking stupid. I liked it when we laughed. I liked it when we danced. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 25. Doug!? Only mathematically. Doug takes this in. Doug, Let me ask you a question. When was the last time you sang a Bon Jovi song? You used to sing Bon Jovi songs at the top of your lungs. Like you didn't care who heard you, or how dopey it sounded. Then one day, you just stopped. That's how it's been with everything. Romance, sense of humor, the way you used to give me that cocky little wink when you took off your shirt... It's all faded away, leaving just a shell of what you used to be. Why? Why no more Bon Jovi songs? Like what? You have a great career, a perfect family. Money is fine. The only thing that could be weighing you down is me. Is it me? Are you tired of me? Then eat them. I'd rather have you sing  than have a thirty-four waist. No, you don't, Doug. I buy your pants. Look. We've been married ten years. And personally, I'd like to be married fifty more, but if you stay like this... Then... I don't know... I took it away from him at the party. He  wouldn't stop waving it at Bob and  Dudley. It might be. But I'm desperate, Doug. I want us to be happy again. So go on it. It's my anniversary present to you. All I want is old Doug back. Please. This marriage can't survive without him.  Doug takes this in, and smiles at her. She's a good wife, and he knows it. Suddenly, BOB enters the room. Where's Karen? You all need this trip. Doug gives her a knowing nod, then turns to Bob. Oh, no. These little squirts like to No, Mama. This place has little rocks Get out of the damn water! Now! The kids climb out of the water and the parents hurry off with them down the path. After a moment of awkward silence, Doug looks at the guys. Just stay calm, Dad. At least it's not all of them, this time. I'll take care of them, Daddy. (to guys, extra polite) Good morning. Maggie smiles. She has a radiant sweetness, even though she's scared to death. DUDLEY stares at her, captivated. He's in love. where would you gentleman like to sit? And what would you gentleman like today? Doug looks to the next table, where a man is enjoying french toast. Of course. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Maggie quickly puts it back on the man's table. Hi. Dudley is wide-eyed. Excuse me? Wow. You like macs too, huh? I've got a vintage Apple 2e. Restored it from scratch. Dudley's jaw drops. Wow. I like fig newtons. Dudley collects himself and tries to speak. You want to dance? Dudley goes to respond, then decides to just give an emphatic nod. Maggie smiles. Well, we can't seat many people in there, but at least we're back in business. Ah, we're used to them costing us money. Last year we spent more on window glass than pancake batter. All because of them. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 95. No, I meant... They damage the diner a lot. They damage the whole town. I'm just sorry you guys got dragged into it. You were just out to have a good vacation. Dudley looks at Maggie sincerely. You bikers probably tell all the girls that. This hits Dudley. He suddenly looks troubled. You're not a geek, Dudley. You're sweet and your honest and... You're the coolest guy I know. Your cat is crazy if it doesn't like you as much as I do. Dudley smiles. He has completely fallen for her. Well, I better get back inside. I've got to set some chairs up in the family room for the lunch rush. People gotta eat. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 96. Maggie smiles and heads inside. Dudley watches her go, then grits his teeth. Hey, guys. Where's Dudley? No. I thought he went to find you guys. Doug shares a worried glance with Bob and Woody. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 100. Sweet Dudley. He went there to save everybody and now they're going to break his hands. Wait, he did this because of me. I have a thousand dollars in tip money I want to put in. I told you I was coming, Bob! Hey, honey. Kelly kisses Doug. He smiles, glad to see her. Karen said you guys were in trouble. I kept calling your cell, but somebody programmed it to not receive calls from our house. Doug shoots Woody a look. Well, I hope you guys had a nice trip. Now get in the van. We're going home. Oh, no. No way! I came all the way out here, rented a car, drove to this podunk As Karen is saying this, Bob looks over at the guys, then back to Karen. He can't take it anymore. Okay. Sorry... Just... be careful. Karen shyly kisses Bob on the cheek. Bob can't believe it. So are you going, too? There he is! I saw old Doug! Doug blushes. What about work? And Billy's school? Doug shrugs like he hasn't a care in the world.
