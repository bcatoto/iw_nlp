I know. Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride? His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there. I have his journal. Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian. You heard me. Oh cut the shit, Kathryn. Thank you. I'll be fine. That's right. You might say that. I don't think so. Annette Harrison. Okay... You promise not to say anything? Forever. I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy. I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him. What do you mean? No. I mean. I don't know. What else do you know about him? Nothing. Really? I thought he said it all the time. But you knew this was important to me. You don't know how to love. Why are you trying to hurt me? I love you. What are you saying? Yeah, me neither. Would you like a tour? Hi. I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house. Was it -- Hi. Please don't go. How am I a hypocrite? Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms. I think that's for the best. Where are you going? It's because I don't trust myself with you. I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please. You really want to know? That's not fair. I have feelings for you. I thought you said we were going to be friends. Why are you doing this? Bonjour Monsieur Philipe. Who's Monsieur Philipe? Not at all. Have a seat. No? Oh dear, are you actually laughing? Fine. Lighten up. It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously. No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me. That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person. You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady. You must take me for a real idiot. "I actually feel good about myself?" Oh please. Okay. You? Volunteer? I don't think so. I'm doing some volunteer work. Sure. Have a good night. You're not gonna start that again. Somerset Maugham. What are you reading? What are you doing? Wait, don't hang up. It wasn't a date. He's just a friend. I'm... I'm alright. No, not at all. It's not about being happy. You and I can't - If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends. Alright. I want you to leave and go back to New York. And you promise to abide by it? You truly want to do something to make me happy? That's also none of your business. I'm busy. That's none of your business. I can't. I'm seeing a friend. Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual. You don't even know me. I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior. And that's a bad thing? I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends. It was fine. I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me. Give it up. No thank you. That's repulsive. You're naked. I'm sorry, but you're not my type. I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends. Because you act like a pig. Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work. Shut up. Thank you. Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time. I never said that. About what? How's the water? The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away. I sincerely doubt it. This is my favorite part. Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it. You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible. Give me a minute. I'll be right down. Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse. At this hour? I don't think so. You need help. Romantic? He rapes her. You've read The Fountainhead? The Fountainhead. Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read. Excuse me. Excuse me! Alright, I said I was sorry. Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot. Why are you being so dramatic? It's not really important. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question. A friend wrote me. Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it? I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions. That's a first. Most people praised me for it. You did? Are you often this offensive on a first encounter? No. I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies. No. Junior. German. Ben Schwarz. My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time. My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick. It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.Doesn't ring a bell. Schwarz. Jewish? I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name? I'm sorry about that. Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?I'll see you tomorrow. Doctor King is my favorite. Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera. Oh, I suck. I suck. Okay. I'm in the bath, mom. Those are my letters! Where did you find those? What are the boys like? Cool. It's like a secret society. But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it? I don't love him. I love Ronald. I am? I did? Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one. What do I do then? If that's what you call it. No. Well... not exactly. I don't know. If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night. It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me. I... I don't think you want to know. Something awful happened last night. Who is it? Best friends. You'd do that for me? Why? Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room. Okay. I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him. I don't know. No. Is it that obvious? What are you saying? That was cool. Okay. It was nothing. I guess. It still sounds gross. Are you for real? Eww. No. That's gross. Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do? You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared. What a loser she must be. Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend. He's alright. He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July. Thanks. Nice meeting you. What was that? Prude. Want a blow job? Need any company? Where are you going? Is it me? I'm sorry. I like it better when I'm on top. Am I suppose to be this sore? Want to join me? But - What are you doing? Just a kiss, right? And then I can go home? Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom. My mom? Don't call my mom. I want to go home. I want to go home. I look terrible. What are you doing? You think he'll like it? But I thought high school is only four years. What year are you in? My father just took me on a trip to Australia.Would you please leave. Good luck, Sebastian. Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s. My daughter, Rachel. I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble. No it doesn't. I see right through you. You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian. This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you. No. This is going to be our last session. I think that's all the time we have for today. Don't you want to change that? But you said you have the worst reputation. And you haven't made an ounce of progress. Jesus. We've been at this for six months. Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid? Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle. Who told you? Honey, is something wrong?You can't do this to me. It could ruin me. You didn't show it to anybody? You what? Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he - Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect. Excuse me? Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I... turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but - Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine. Are you okay? I'm sure you're going to love it there. Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood. Did you know Sebastian well? Have we met? I'm Kathryn. That's one way of looking at it. Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it. So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible. Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you. I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman. Cecile, you had an orgasm. Well did you like it? Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did. Well what then? He made you give him a blow job. So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you. Why didn't you do something? Does your mother know? Cecile, you have to tell me. What do you mean?! Calm down. Tell me what's wrong. It's Kathryn. Of course I would. We're friends, right? Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house. I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me. Did you hide the letters? Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never. Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me. Well do you like him? That's so romantic. Have you responded? Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you. Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime. Eyes closed. Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is. See that wasn't so bad. Do you want to learn or not? It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me. Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends? What are you scared of? That's great. Really? Bulimic headcase. So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice. I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum. I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language. Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and -- I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to. It's been going on for a while. Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me. And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got... I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over. It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind. No. It's Kathryn. Ronald? What do you do? Tell her you love her. Likewise I'm sure. I think you have your answer. And if I don't? Get out! Didn't you hear what I said? I accept. Now get out. Fine! Get off me! Get off me! I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers. You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. Cheers. Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you. To my triumph, of course. Well done. Not that it's any of your business but yes. I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company. Well done. Annette? Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room? A little melodramatic, don't you think. I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." Poor fatty never had a chance. How have you dumped girls in the past? Why so nervous? Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away. Is that what you think? Not anymore you don't. It's obvious. At first it was, but now it's become something bigger. I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore. P-whipped, p-whipped. Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped. I want to fuck. And that's why you're leaving? Excuse me? Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping. No, tell me. Oh come on. For her first time? Tell me all the details. You didn't? Kind of. She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends. You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again. You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago. If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her. You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump. So what went wrong? She shot you down. Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus? So? How'd it go last night? Morning! Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride? And that's why you're losing your bet? She's really getting to you, isn't she? What's your problem? Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley. Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book. That her? Who are you spying on? I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems. Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day." I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out? What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience. I'm aware. Cecile. Well, let me know when you do. Until then. Have you succeeded in your task? I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny. Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good. I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo. Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder. The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher. No. Interesting. What's wrong with you? Shhh. Call me later. Loser. Fuck her yet? It would feel so yummy. You can put it anywhere. Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you. In English. I'll fuck your brains out. I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married. If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine. Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer? I'll think about it... You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league. B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy. Jesus Christ, is she for real? I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge? Why not? She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie. I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery. Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered. I don't find this very funny, In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent. Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you. Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid. I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing. Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall. Oh please. I can't have you do that. You will be discreet about this? I know. She's so young and he's so - It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher. Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and... It's Cecile. I hope I didn't keep you from something. Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples. I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I... turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works. You're too kind. I'll do my best.Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch. Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now. Margarita found them while cleaning your room. Cecile, is that the best you can do? You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before. It's the least I can do. Let me get that for you. Absolutely. I can't thank you enough. Black. Ronald? That's crazy. Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it? What about her? Not at all. What's wrong? I got your message and came as quick as I could. Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse. That's beautiful. How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength? I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her. Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell. Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?! Is that so? I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child. Who the hell do you think you are?!I understand. Good night. I'll do that. Young man, I already told you she's not here. Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so - She's out. She's not here. What do you want? I'll do that. I've already told you, she's not home. You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.Oh... no thank you... Excuse me? I did? We played backgammon? I did? Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there. Mom? Are you there? Mom? Mother!!!! Nudie pictures, what do you think? Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet. You don't know him. I'm so stupid. He told me he loved me and I believed him. Hi, mom.
