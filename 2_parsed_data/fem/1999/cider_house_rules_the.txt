There's something wrong with him! He  never makes a sound. Do you live here? Once, when they took out my appendix. No one's touched your appendix. Whatever it was... the ether made me  sick. I can't pay for this, you know--I  got no money. Only if you can afford it. I don't wanna see it! You don't have to see it, dear. Don't  worry. I don't even wanna know what sex it  is--don't tell me! Your *baby's* going to be okay, too. I don't wanna know! Let me see him, for Christ's sake--I  wanna see him. She's a prostitute, isn't she? It's called French Lunar Solution. It claims to restore monthly  regularity. Look! I don't remember. Maybe I was kissing someone and he  bit me. I must have been *dreaming* of kissing  someone. "Oh Lord, support us all the day  long..." "...until the shadows lengthen and  the evening comes, and the busy world  is hushed, and the fever of life is  over, and our work is done." "Then in Thy mercy grant us save  lodging, and holy rest, and peace at  the last." Amen! Amen! Amen! Maybe to scare us... Buster is mine. You two get  Copperfield and Curly. Nobody touches  Fuzzy. Stop it! No fighting! *Share* the  snowballs! They attacked us--just like the Japs! Listen to you, Fuzzy! You've been  running. You get to the shower! I know the type--they'll take one of  the babies. Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting  in your office. If people want to adopt one of us,  they should have to take the oldest  first. Please, Mary Agnes! This is Hazel's  special day--don't make her feel  sad. Hazel's practically the youngest of  us. She should be the *last* to leave! At least Hazel can talk. Usually  they take one of the stupid babies. They take the babies so they won't  ever have to tell them that they  were orphans! I'm not a baby! If you cry, Hazel, they'll just send  you back. Mary Agnes, that's not true! That's what they did to me! You *wanted* to come back--that's  why you cried. You can cry if you feel like it,  Hazel. You cry as much as you want. I thought they might take me. Nobody ever wants me! Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone  take *any* of us! Nobody's asked for me, have they? You mean somebody asked? Let us be happy for Hazel. Hazel has  found a family. Good night, Hazel. Good night, Hazel! Good night, Hazel!  Good night, Hazel! You weren't dreaming about me. Then I wasn't beautiful. It was just the ether, Wilbur... No one but me ever put a hand on me,  to feel that baby. Don't you want to  touch it or put your ear down to it? Put your ear there. Go on. You shouldn't have a baby if there's  no one who wants to put his face  right there! Stay right there. Right where you  are. Stay right here. Right here. How could she be his *mother*? They just want you to hire some new  help. We have a delivery. Imminent, in my  estimation... No one's going to hurt you, dear.  Have you come to visit us? We have  beds, you know. Have you had any  breakfast? What's your name? Her temperature is a hundred and  four. It wasn't me! He said he was a doctor. I would  never have stuck that inside me! It wasn't me! I would never do no  such thing! I wouldn't stick that  inside me! It wasn't me! That's a heavy sedation. So many children. Are they all  orphans? Oh, they're getting into the car...  watch your fingers! I'm the best. You are? I'm the best one. Here, blow... I really *am* the best, I just have  a cold. Blow! There, I bet that feels better. Yeah. *Tell* them! I'm the one. I'm the best! *Tell* them! Candy. Candy Kendall. Two. Excuse me, Homer. Dr. Larch said  this one is your turn. Oh, dear--I'm sorry. I meant the  circumcision. That boy you delivered  on Tuesday... I'll get started. Steerforth got into the pantry--he's  eaten all the pie dough. He wasn't sharing it, either. He's down the hall, throwing up. Boy or girl? It was nothing--it's all over. I would like to have a baby, one  day. I really would. Why, of course--you can have as many  children as you want. I'm sure you'll  have very beautiful children. Going where? Does he have a plan of  some kind? Will he be back soon? He's leaving... He'll need clothes... some money... Oh, just stop it! You knew this was  going to happen. He's a young man. Just find him some clothes, Wilbur.  He could use some clothes. You'll need some money--just a little  something, until you find a job. I'm okay--I can walk. No--keep it down. I want to feel the  air. Coming with us? It's always a good  idea to have a doctor along for the  ride. Let us be happy for Homer Wells... Homer Wells has found a family. Good  night, Homer! Wally thinks apples are boring. You said, "Apples aren't exactly  flying." There! You said it was boring. No, but I work there--I like it. My  dad's a lobsterman. Really? I couldn't have a baby with someone  who's leaving me--I didn't know what  else to do! He's going to be dropping bombs on  Mandalay! They're going to be shooting  at him! Burma! I can't have a baby alone. I don't  even know if he's coming back! You don't *know*, Wally. You have no  *idea*! Stay away from me! I'm a little worried about the... ...about how much bleeding is okay. I guess I'll see you around the  orchards. Thanks for everything. I love you, Wally. That sink's backed up again, Wally.  I thought you was gonna get me a  plumber. Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber? He's stayin' *here*? What kind of a name is Homer? What's that? What you got a picture of your heart  for? So what? They told Muddy his feet was too  flat! I can't read. Nobody taught me. What does it say there? *Whose* rules? It's too late for that one! I know what you've been doing. You've been giving him a *flying*  lesson! He thinks people *like* to get whacked  by branches. Did she leave you, Wally? Who's the boy? Wally, you can marry Debra if Candy  leaves you! You can marry all three of us, Wally! We can take turns. Wilbur! Wilbur! Wilbur, you should read this. It's from the Board. Another letter. Uh... "merely suggesting that some  new blood might benefit you all...  someone with new ideas in the  obstetrical and pediatric fields." I think they're just testing some  ideas for our next meeting. Dr. Holtz seems nice. I think he  only wants to help... It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to  be careful of, Wilbur. So what are you going to do? Homer was born *here*, in, what was  it, 1922? This is *your* life story, Wilbur!  You just changed the dates! You *invented* him! You've completely  made his up! You mean they'll replace you with  someone who won't perform abortions. These *credentials* are against the  law! But what about school records? Homer  doesn't have any *diplomas*... Oh, Wilbur, I don't know... We don't even know where he is! Where's that Homer? Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's  shoes *every* night. What's lucky about that? I have a *ton* of things that would  fit you. So. Not bored yet? When I'm not thinking about Wally.  I'm not good at being alone. Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm  fine. I... ...I don't suppose you've seen a  lobster yet. You have to come to my dad's lobster  pound and see one, then. I don't think Mr. Rose would leave  without you. Sorry! Come next week! Whoa--look at that Homer! He's gettin'  all dressed up for supper tonight! He ain't gettin' dressed to have  supper with *us*, Peaches! It's time somebody ate *them*. Daddy, it's a letter to *me*. Wally said to say, "Hello." Yes. But it's closed all the time  now, because of the blackout. When they watched at all. Do you  like movies? You've seen only one movie? Which  one? I haven't seen "King Kong" since I  was a kid! That's a pie apple, Wilbur. Homer  said you're not supposed to eat it! Wilbur, he picked them for us  himself... He probably doesn't make much money  picking apples--he must have had to  pay to send them, too. Wilbur, it's a *gift*! How can you  be angry with Homer for sending us a  *gift*? But you looked as if you liked it. She *did* love him! How many women have you known? She was torn apart! She died of a  broken heart. Well, she was in a weakened  condition... I don't know! What about "King Kong"?!  Is that medically possible? What is you *doin'* with that Candy,  Homer? You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I  hope. That Candy--she's the nicest girl I  know! That sounds like you is in trouble  already, Homer. Yeah, you is. I know when people is  in trouble, and you is. Do you know him? I fail to see how someone courageous  enough to make a commitment to a  foreign mission is automatically to  be dismissed--that part of the world  requires precisely the kind of  dedication that is needed here. You can't think that a man who has  *served* under such conditions as  exist over there will be in the  slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and  primitive and full of *disease* that  part of the world is? I fail to see how a little  Christianity could *hurt* anyone  here! Yes, *very*! Dr. Homer Wells. It's a nice name, very New England. *Very*! I just wanted to ask you... Does he *know* he's supposed to be  in India? Does he even *want* to  come back? You don't wanna go in the knife  business with Mistuh Rose--just say  you're in the *apple* business, Jack! The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*... Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer? We should drown that damn Jack in  the vat! Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand  off, and all you cut off *him* was  his clothes! You're a natural. You were born to  drive a car like this. Yes... and no. When you come here,  you don't really care about the movie. What are you so crazy about the movies  for? At least you were never lonely. You don't miss it? But you had so much *responsibility*. Just a little privacy. Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies. Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally. The *speaker*. For the movie sound. Scrunch down like this. You just cuddle. You come to hug...  to kiss. You don't *come* here to  watch the movie. Not with the right girl you wouldn't. Lucky Fuzzy! Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer? Sorry, Homer... Nobody will swim here until next  summer. By then, the water will have  rubbed the glass smooth against the  sand--there won't be any sharp edges. See? That's last year's glass, or  from some year before. I put glass  here every year. The ocean makes it  beautiful. Give me your hand. *Nobody* volunteers for the Burma  run--he said so himself. And nobody  knows *me* better than him! So how  am I supposed to feel? He's a bomber  pilot and I'm just selfish, I know.  Well, I'm *not* a brave little girl  and I'm *not* sorry. I *know* this was right. I told you. I'm not good at being  alone. I told him, too. I *know* this was right. He's in a big hurry, all right. I  told you he's in trouble. It will be okay. We have to wait and see. I think  that, for *everything* in life, you  have to wait and see. Maybe we're doing the snails a favor,  Daddy. Good night, Daddy. We'll just have to wait and see. We see you next harvest. You just stay out of trouble, Homer! So, you're staying. Olive told me. You might have told me yourself. It's that Homer! It look nicer then home! How is that Wally doing? Oh, he's fine! I just heard from  him. He's bombing all these places... They ain't drops--I picked 'em off  the tree! Do you think I'm having a good time?  Do you think I'm just *teasing* you?  Do you think I *know* whether I want  you or Wally? I grew up with Wally. I began my  adult life with him. No! That's not all there is to it! I  love you, too--I *know* I do. It's a good thing I didn't have that  baby, isn't it? Ain't you eatin' with us, Rose? She used to eat with us. Now we ain't  good enough for her, I guess. I guess you must like watchin' me be  sick... Not yet. What do you know about it? Don't trouble yourself about it,  Homer--this ain't your business. *Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How  am I supposed to take care of a baby!  I can't have a baby. You think Daddy's gonna let me go  anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*. Why don't you just go back to your  pickin', Homer? I can take care of  it myself! We should take her to St. Cloud's.  That much is obvious, isn't it? Let  her make up her mind when she gets  there... Well, we have to help her! We have to do *something*. Don't we? Homer? Hi... Hi... I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them  with me. I don't need no more clothes, thank  you. Rose, I know what's going on. Homer  told me. I got pregnant, too--about  a year ago. I've been through this. You ain't been through what I been  through, Candy. Yes, I *have*! Who's the father, Rose? You want to have the baby? I know where you can go. Homer and I  can take you... I can't go nowhere. Why? Is it the father? Does he know? You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's  not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it  Muddy? No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just... It sure ain't Jack. She won't go to St. Cloud's! You don't understand! It's her  father... He's the *father*! He's her baby's  father! We've got to keep her away from that  bastard! No! No! Who cares about their *gear*? He was in Burma for twenty days  without a compass? Daddy, *please*... Good night, Daddy. Nothing. No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally  to come home. I'm afraid to see him,  too. No, don't--that's something. Nothing  is nothing. Don't even look at me. I want... ...to do nothing. Please don't move, don't go anywhere. If you're trying to be funny, Homer... Stop it! Just cut it out! For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been  shot down! He's *paralyzed*! What do you want me to *do*? You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please... I ain't your business no more, Daddy.  Please let me go. That's right, Homer. This ain't your  business. The bleeding should taper off  tomorrow, but it can come back again.  The cramps will ease up, almost  entirely. The bleeding is usually  much lighter in two days. As long as  the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal. Look at that. Them same damn rules  is tacked up again! I want to hear what they are, first. Homer, let me hear what they are. That's the best place to eat lunch! Why don't they just say, "Stay off  the roof!"? That's *it*? It means nothin' at all! And all  this time I been *wonderin'* about  it! They're *outrageous*, them rules! Please don't make me say it again. Please... that's enough. I *loved*  you, too--you know I did. Please don't... You say that as though it's some  awful thing! I never stopped loving Wally! She took off in the night! Do you think she'll be all right? This came for you a couple of days  ago. Olive asked me to bring it.  With everything happening, I guess  she forgot. I know you don't think much of being  needed, or of me for that matter... No, I'm the one who should be sorry.  You have every right to be angry. Dear Homer, I am writing to tell you  about Wilbur. I can assure you that the overdose  was entirely accidental. Let us be happy for Dr. Larch. Dr.  Larch has found a family. He ain't never been outta Maine! Let me tell you somethin' about  Florida, Homer. It's so nice 'n' warm down there,  you can pick them grapefruits and  oranges *naked*, if you want to. Homer, stayin' in Maine ain't movin'  on! Dr. Larch often wondered how the  world was treating you. He talked a lot about you, hoping  you would be of use, whatever you  were up to. "Oh, Lord, support us all the day  long..." "...until the shadows lengthen and  the evening comes, and the busy world  is hushed, and the fever of life is  over, and our work is done." "Then, in Thy mercy grant us a safe  lodging, and a holy rest, and peace  at the last." Amen! Amen! Amen! Did you bring something for me? We made up a room for you. Wouldn't you be more comfortable by  yourself? Homer, do you know what this is? Actually, it's Fuzzy's. There's  nothing wrong with your heart. Dr. Larch wanted to keep you out of  the war, Homer--that's why he did  it. That's why he told you it was  yours. I think he worried about his own  heart. He said it would never stand  up to Homer Wells going off to war. What happens next?
