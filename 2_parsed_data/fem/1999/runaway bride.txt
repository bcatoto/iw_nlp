I'll get the dress. We'll rub. We do it to our dog. And in a "V". That's it. Back to obedience school. Rub your ears. I love his eyes. I just believe they're listening to you. "Nothing but net." "Sink the putt." Bob's in a hurry. Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding? She's already done this.Where do you think she's going? I'm sorry, too. Wow. That only took us between years to say. No. No, you didn't. Fisher, let him talk. I'm sorry, Ike. This is permanent. I already made an appointment for later today. No, that's what makes you unemployed. Someone reliable, I'm sure. A booze- hound in a bar? That's not nothing to do with it. You cooked this story up and you know it. Journalism lesson number one. If you fabricate your facts, you get fired. -- It's for you, Ike. I left four messages. You don't return my calls. Poor Ike. Look, he's running after her. Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..." Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison. ... Just call me when you have it. Ike, how is the story coming? Is she a man-eater?Yes. Right. I've got news for you. No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic. I'm not running. You don't understand this guy. At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me? Bob -- are you making friends with this man? What is he up to now? Of course. Of course. I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian. Weird. Like after all those years you would remem-- God... Of course. I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm... Brian -- I've got to go. The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next. Good one! Thanks. And what did you say? What did he ask? What? You talked to him! Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest? He's here!... He's here! It's hurting. Eight is good... "V" could be Victory. Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully. I borrowed it from this guy I know. So? "I guarantee that we'll have tough times. I guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me". I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part. And I've been practicing it. Ready? They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you. I didn't. And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that. I think so... When I was walking down the aisle? I was walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was. And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted. So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me. I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things. It's something I've always wanted to do. I've been making friends with your cat. Is it okay that I'm here? So, we'll... I'm okay with that. And the church. Yes, you! To who? Are you asking me? I love you, too. Me, either. Okay. So... what, uh... What just happened? Just now? Jus then? In there? Really? About a minute...? I kissed him back. Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect. Hey. No. No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor. Yes I do! That's called changing your mind. What!? Lost! Every one of those times I was being supportive. Something you won't understand. Brian told you that? I already explained about that. That was very interesting research George was doing! It's fun! It's high. I had it under control. Now they feel sorry for me. You humiliated me! Yes. Excuse me? Where did you disappear to? Yes it is. And it doesn't mean anything. Yeah. It's kind of nice. Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one. First I have to find some tools. I need a half and a nine-six-tenth. Your filter's clogged. This takes unleaded. Watch your leg, Dad. I'm so tired of this. No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I wouldn't attempt the impossible. No. You take it. It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust. Ike... Hi, Grandma. You know, there's no... What was that? I can't order my eggs without sarcasm? I'll have the same. Fine. The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine. Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress. Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that? You don't know. Now that's romantic. A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong? So? Is that what you said to her? What do you mean? It was incredibly romantic! It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. Cal Ripken even applauded. He's an entomologist! I thought it was very unique. Still sweet. What an incredible chauvinistic observation. No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday. Maybe someday. I think so. It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in. Six-fifty. Seven-fifty. Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing. Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical? Actually, I meant you. You probably got severance or expenses or both. I'll take your check. No credit cards. My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong. That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either. So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth. You're welcome. Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction. Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud. How do I do it? I'm not that beautiful. You misinterpret everything. We've all been friends our whole lives. But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand. You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her? He is not! Give me that! Grandma made me the cutest outfit. I can't wait to show it to you. We think so. Without oxygen... Twice... Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose. And I have no intention of doing it again. I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work. I still have my job. You're going to be very disappointed. Did something happen to make you care about reality? You have one? Yes. Nervous? Not at all! No. I've never been more certain in my life. Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams. Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash? You know, get all that city grit out of it. Excellent. I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered. Thank you. You still think that he was.... What are you talking about? No, I'm just going to head home. I'm just finishing up, too. No sauntering down the aisle. Just make time. Let's just get there. You and your lucky geese. You always see geese. He's not coming. Watch. He's not coming. Grandma! ... I don't even want to talk about the luau. What's this? Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything. I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was. Lighten up, what? Thanks. Will you fix my hair? It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore. I think you're right. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you? Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness. But I'm weird. But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious! Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out". I'm going to kill myself. On anything male that moves? As opposed to anything male that doesn't move? Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory? Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things. There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg. Ya think? That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot. Okay, he's on base. Can we talk about my life now? -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah. He's totally out to get me. She's the boss. Reporter? I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid. Yes, I've seen it. And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me! No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid. I don't like it. Stop. You may not like having a daughter with problems. But guess what? I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time. I'll eat in my room. No. It's my life. Just stop it. Don't say another word like that. Thank you, Dad. His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady. I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady. Not this one. This one's on me.It's okay. There's no microphone. You're no fun. Tootaloo. Oh, I will. I'm not sure. Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't. He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her. I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say. It's her fourth time to the altar, you know. Not seven like they said. Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact for you. Maybe she hasn't read the paper... You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet. No, no. You're her best friend. You tell Maggie. "And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance. So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground" Holy moly.Oh, come on. You're practically family. You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick. Your two cinnamon rolls. -- The luau for Maggie. Betty Trout. Five dollars.Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate. His hair... any color. "Never say die." "Make the shot." Don't be nervous, Maggie. Let us visualize. Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball." Bob is making her visualize the ceremony. Oh, sure. That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men... This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know. Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"? No, she's talking about your hair. Yep. Maggie -- Someone to see you. And you are? Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater. No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired. It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie. Are you a reporter? Quick. Very quick. Wedding. Wedding. You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row. Okay. Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something? You okay? I'm closing. Let's go. Not eight... No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a "V". See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it. It's for the bell. What happened at the luau? He's going to be the pastor? Would it? This party is for you and Bob. Get your mind off the reporter. Lighten up, wahine. You're right. It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up. Something that brings warmth to my heart. Duckbill platypus. I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids. And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one. No. You're quirky. Quirky and weird are two different things. No. I'm weird. Weird and mysterious are two different things. No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you". Very hard to compete with. Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery. Why? I know. I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves. Yes. Good morning to you, too. You look good. He looks better with that stuff out of his hair. He's an attractive man. Where? Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look! Cory's going for second!... Sneaky! It's probably because you got him fired. For what reason? Some personal satisfaction? Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut. Yup! Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me. You're a goddess! So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh? Yeah. No. No, you tell her. "What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them. She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
