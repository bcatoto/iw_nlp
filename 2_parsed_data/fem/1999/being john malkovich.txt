Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it. Fine. Let's drop it. I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it. Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show. Why are you being like this? But I think I have another plan. No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini! Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini. No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday. It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose. No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream. I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now. Impressions? Those are hard. Vegas? What'd you think? Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing. Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you? Nice to meet you all. Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy. Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help. Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly. I know. People make mistakes. I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle. You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you? Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside. It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way. A better friend. The monkey. It's Elijah. I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question. My God! You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man. I need a shower. Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before. You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway. You fell in love with her first. Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head. What's that? It'll never happen, fuckface. What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously. You bastard. Suck my dick! I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head? Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions. I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship. I'm sorry. That was nasty. Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with. Me and John. We love her, Craig. I'm sorry. Yes. Fuck Maxine. Us, of course. I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus. You've always hated the animals. I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me. I'm getting rid of the fucking animals. Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history. What are you doing? Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it. It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We�ll smoke a joint. Tensions will melt away. You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture. Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man. Don't crowd me, Craig. I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly. Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery. I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing. I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing? Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her? I was, wasn't I? I was John fucking Malkovich! Take me back, Craig. I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was. I have to go back now. I have to go back. I'm scared. Now? I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours. I want to try. Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain. 'kay. No thanks. I'm going to turn in. I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed. The iguana. Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected. I was worried. Did you eat? Hi. She's very beautiful. Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh? They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach. Seven-ish Isn't that cute? I just taught her that. Why, Craig. why? Why'd you do it, Craig? Is the trial date set? The monkey. Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning. Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor? Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around. Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something. Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing. I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak. Hush, sweetheart. Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who? I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it? That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich. Why not? I need to get in there! It's Craig in there, I can tell. You bastard! No. No, I didn't know that. No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine... Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester. But now we've lost access to Craig. I blew it, Dr. Lester. But why, Son of Malkovich? I'm getting divorced. Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom? Yes, of course, Dr. Lester. But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved. Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him! We have to meet. I have to see you. Maxine... Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart. Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly. I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over? After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it. Psychotherapy. I've never been looked at like this by a woman. Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig. Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet? Yes, Hi.J.M. Inc. Be all that someone... How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major. Let him try. Lotte? Is that you? Lotte, this is so good... A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution. Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig. You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin. I've fallen in love. You're late. So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein. Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me. Okay. Here it is. Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc. I'll protect you, Dollface. Sure. It'd be fun. Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me. Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop. Good. We'll sell tickets. Is this Malkovich fellow appealing? What's he been in? Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich? It better be. No. You might want to check those tarot cards one more time. Yikes. You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls. So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy. Good. Now we're getting somewhere. Not a chance. I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene. You're a fag or a liar. Don�t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off. Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time. My tits? The usual, Barry. You married? Just. I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated. Somebody told you. Who told you? Who told you? Why not? Yeah. What? You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo. And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants. Yes, well... I wouldn't know. How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog! Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?. Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors. Two hundred dollars, please. You can be John Malkovich. No. Don't be an ass. No. I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken. Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon. One hour. Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers. J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be. I love you, Lotte. When? Yes? Ah. And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me. Let her go, Craig. I mean �him." Hi, uh. Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..." Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. Hi, are you Craig's wife? Whatever. Yeah what?! Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again. You've got to be kidding. Bad dream, darling? Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just... Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top. Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us? This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen. Vegas. It's okay, my sweet. Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant! No one would ever have to know its not him. Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally. Stay in him forever? You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people! That was incredible. You're brilliant! I'd love to see your work. Wow. Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey. You still there, sweets? I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it. Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now. Lotte called me. Oh shut up. Craig, darling are you in there? I can explain about the portal, darling. Darling! Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold. Oh, Lotte... Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte. Do you mind? So, do you enjoy being an actor? Thanks so much for coming over. Whatever you're having. It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and... You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours. Mr. Malkovich?Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable? I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart. I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions. Captain Mertin?Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it�s for. Ha ha ha! Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings? Hello, Don.Count me in. Do we get to wear a crown? You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
