"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc? -- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass. I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it -- He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer. He liked to acquire things. It's happened before. I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it. I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I? We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon. It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened. Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99. I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written." -- The argument had nothing to do with it. Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids. I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday. Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm. They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more. What do you think about that? It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous. I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me. Why are they ganging up against me? What do they want from me? What have I done that's so wrong? They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something... Even you probably have things.Well, come on in. You do? Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise. It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees. I'd better get in there. I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so... Oh? Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love. Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes. Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing. Yes, you do, you damn well do. I want to give you something. Will you let me? Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal. I don't want you to be mad at Skip... Doc. Doc... ...so accomplished. It's a pleasure to meet you. You're on your own today, honey. They come through a few times each year. Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again! It's a tour. No gentleman caller, Doc. Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening. Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful? You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park. It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard. Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20. And the Brocketts? Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so. Nice car. How's that place? Doc. Ainge... Not sure. Let me think about it. So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret? You know who that is, don't you? You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down. Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long. And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined. How long you been in this town? You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything. Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is. I think it's like... inquisitive. Who was that? You're early... it's not ready. What happened?It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister. What kind of doctor are you? Do you think that's a good idea? What's happening here? Mumford... like the town? Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter. No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling. Just who is here, can you tell me? Well, look who's here... Take a hike, Dr. Quack! -- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl. Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it. I think you do. I think you know what I mean. Finally, some common sense... What? What'd you want? Oh... not a real doctor.He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage. I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune. I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines. ...What balls on this guy? What're we... ...going steady? Jesus. First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see -- He said -- "Which we already knew!" ...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded." No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself? Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo. There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer... This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial? I don't think you know what you're talking about. These appointments were not my idea, remember. What are you talking about? I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew. What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing... Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous. Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look. It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something... I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever... Which we already knew... Have women found you attractive? Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew! The point is, you have a lot of the signs. Fuck the community. There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating. Pro boner? Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly? The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that? Don't do that thing... ...that shrink thing. Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff? In maybe three or four issues. ...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.Mother... go away! Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway. We're going for a walk. Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford. Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast. We're only talking about six weeks. You got off easy. What is your name? ...but first, you have to tell me something... Oh. I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood. What? But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done. I am irate! You deserve it. You feel violated? ...How violated I feel? Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called. Which show was that? Mother... I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities -- Hello? Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion... ...that I am in love with you. Transference! I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well. The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean? I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings. Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way. First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you. All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you? No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth-- Why? Is there something I should have heard about you? How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me. Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford. It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship. I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in? Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you. Not one who's treating me, of course. And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence. You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to. Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you. Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is. I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me. -- you've been a tremendous help to me. I bet I know what changed your mind... ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me. My brother said you were about to fire me. Why'd you come to the house the other night? Which thing? When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down. And this is legitimate therapy? It's all right. I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old? And he's where? So whose route is this? No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so. And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing That was really bad, wasn't it? ...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me. You're purposely making me talk while we do this... ...because you think this is good for me... ...and you're a sadistic bastard... Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it. Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second? I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way. Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip. You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts? So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage? Is that like a party trick? No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache. I don't know if I mentioned the headaches. Where? Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused. Uh-huh. Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble. My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?... I'm embarrassed. The list is so long. 'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach. Is this the treatment? No. You've got a funny idea of funny. What? Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"... We don't discuss it. Is that the technical description of what I've got? She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time. It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about. Mom's such a cutie. Oh boy... this should be interesting. I'm not making any promises. Can I ask you something? Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient? So what changed? Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down. You have the best answer for everything. You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny? I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying. I don't know. I barely made it today. What would you do? Even if you don't think it's real? Hmm? Is that a professional opinion? No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite. That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true. I saw it. I saw it in your eyes. You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you? About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit. Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you... ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve. I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
