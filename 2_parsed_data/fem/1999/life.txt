I'll come back for you in a little  while, Willie... Claude. Here's to your new job down  at the bank. I always knew you'd  make something of yourself. I was hoping you were gonna say an  engagement ring, Claude. That's what respectable folks do.  Get a job, get married, start having  babies. That's what you want, isn't  it? But I'm having a good time... If you boys can read so good, how  come you missed that sign in the  window? Those are whites-only pies. And I bet this right here will turn  you into a colored pie. Don't be concentrating so hard, baby.  You're liable to seize yourself again. I've never seen you in here before. I'm Sylvia. What's your name? Can't you remember your own name? Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a  girl a drink? Two bourbons. He looks like he can take care of  himself. You're cute. You have any money,  Claude? Why would you want to go home? It's  so early. Creamed chip beef on toast. Except  we're outta beef, so I had to  improvise. Those are for trusties, unless you  got thirty cents or two packs of  cigs. Problem with the toast? At least he didn't kill Santa Claus  with his bare hands. Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint. Didn't even get to have my peach  cobbler. I appreciate you going to all this  trouble over my corn bread. I don't  get a lot of compliments in my line  of work. You got your own nightclub? Rayford! I heard some things so I went to see  Spanky Johnson. He told me what  happened and gave me some money to  get down here. What happened to your  face? Nice to meet you all. Quite comfortable, thank you. Them cookies in there? Yes, oatmeal. No. No I don't. Yeah... Rayford, I wanted so much more for  you than this. Don't you lie to me, Rayford. You still have your daddy's watch? Well, this is all I can give you. I  wish it was more. Don't argue with me. You need it  more than I do. I know how a little  money can help in a place like this. Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever  say that. He gave up hope. That's  where you gotta be different. I gave you life. And they can't take  it away from you. Remember that.  You'll get outta here someday. I  believe that. You gotta believe it,  too. Of course I did. He said he'd file  an appeal right away. You didn't  tell me he was so good looking. He seemed like a pretty good lawyer  to me. His offices take up an entire  floor of that big, new building on  125th Street, and he was using all  these words I never heard before. He  even offered me a job. Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to  know if he should file the appeal on  behalf of your friend, too. Sure, Claude, whatever you say. Still too hot to sleep. Ray, my man, this steak is like  butter! How about some steak sauce? Sorry, Cap'n. Look, daddy. They caught those two  men who escaped last night. Nagger? Nigger. A night in the hole? I'll take Claude to die on Wednesday  for fifty cents. Mmm-mm, that girl's got gams. Don't pay attention to the  superintendent, Tom. You're going to  stay for supper, aren't you? I handled your mama, didn't I? Don't  y'all worry. I got plans for that  bad boy. Ain't none of him going to  waste. Of course, the superintendent's hoping  for a boy, but personally, I'd prefer  a girl. Whatever it is will be a little gift  from heaven. Look at the way she  glows. Heads up, here comes trouble. I beg to differ. That cute little  rascal belongs to me... The magnolias are blooming early  this year, daddy. Are you Claude Banks? My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me.  You look just like she said. Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming  today. She got married last month. Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player.  They moved down to New Orleans. She always said that if you were on  the outside... I know she's sorry she won't be seeing  you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me  to take care of you. You know, go to the tonk or whatever. Want me to come back some other time? Who wants Jell-O? Is everyone here? Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him.  Claude! Has anyone seen Claude? Wait for the firemen! You can't go in there, Ray! You'll  never make it!
