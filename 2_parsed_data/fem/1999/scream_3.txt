Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you bad  mouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as famous as you are today. The least you can do is show me a little god damn respect. Hardly as large as I'd like it to be. No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes. All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut. I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie. Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down. Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting. I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired. Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie. What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident. Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you. There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish. No, the other one. The one who played his wife. I know who you're talking about. Rebecca something. Yeah I think. Anyway, point is, she had a stalker. Sonny Bono had a stalker. David Letterman had one too. So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds, Jody Foster, -- Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex with that doesn't look like you. GALE WEATHERS! Oh my God! Shit. Listen, I know we've never met, and  I don't mind you never returning my calls,  but I have to tell you that after two films  I feel like I am in your mind. Well, that would explain my constant headaches.   You know I'm sorry that things didn't work out  on '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment'  that's a pretty good fall back. Thank you.  I'm sorry that things didn't work out  with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty  good fall back. Gives me more time for my work.   After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex  character. And to be played by an actress with such  depth and range.   No answer at Sid's. Where'd  the Detective go? Hello? Laura I think I just killed somebody. Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! No I need to call you. Just you. Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? Are you listening to me, huh? It's mother, Sidney, now be a good  girl and turn on the news. DO IT! STAB 3. Oh God I've gotta get myself  a better agent. Anybody home? Doubt that. Anyone here? Fuck you very much! Tyson go to hell! What the hell are you doing here? Where's Roman? Make-up. You need it. Hey, Roman isn't here? Damn. He called my roommate and told her  he had some important things he wanted to  go over with me in his office tonight. For the honorary field of directing and  cinematography in music videos. How to the point. Oh shit. Hello? Director's office. Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at  your   music video awards. What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who  gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes! I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old.  I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm  not happy that my character is too stupid not to  have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been  cut into McNuggets. Huh, fine. Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello? Who's this? This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some  clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have  to start the scene in the shower!  The whole  shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I  mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering? Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have  the wrong number. I'm hanging up right now. Roman that's not the line. Has there been another goddamn rewrite?    How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our  lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes? What?  What movie? Shit. No! No! Noooo! You! How can I ever get any fame playing you! God damn you Gale Weathers!  Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his  victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so  his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's  Candy, and now me! I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote  a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy.  He wrote Arlington Street. What are you talking about? Because of this shit I'll probably never  act in a Hollywood film again. Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina? What about her? What if it's the killer? Do you smell something? Oh shit it's my cell! Hello? It's him! It's the killer! What's your favorite scary movie Gale? God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead! (screaming) That's me. First and Last. Nope. They opened up a Hollywood Video  down the street. It pays better. Anyway, I'm here because I heard on the news about the murders and well, I found this while rooting through Randy's things. Don't worry Sid. I got tickets to see Family Feud. I did have a somewhat ulterior motive for driving all the way down here. Geez. Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing? Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie,  no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants  to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you.   So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way,  if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and  since they really want to kill you, they won't  kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense? You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter. That's funny. Need to get in that building? There a story in that building? Gale Weathers would find a way. Basements creep me out. Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do. Bitch. Can I help you? I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need? Nope. Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those  files except studio execs. Can you please go away now? The president . . . of the studio. Twenty dollars? Who are you Nancy Drew? Go ahead. It's worth three grand easy. My Gale Weather's will stop at nothing to get the story. Follow me. I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott -- Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will. Rina Reynolds. What a stage name. You should talk, Judy Jurgenstein. Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday. You know, JOHN MILTON, the horror producer? Those were some of his early flicks. We've found out where she went. Sidney, what happened? Rina Reynolds. Good twist. Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story  of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and  you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER! Oh God Gale, Dewey was right. Stop getting so nervous and you might stop causing me to gag! I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member. Excuse me Gale! What the hell    do you think you're doing? What? What'd you find? Guys! I got a bad feeling. Guys there's someone else in the fucking room! Time to sort things out. Whatta you say? No. Not all of it. Sid, someone really   wants to meet you. Uh-un Sid. You're not gonna run off. Not now. That's me Sid. I always idolized you. You were always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney.  I wanted to make you proud. Roman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's freaking me out!
