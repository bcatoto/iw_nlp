That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him. Well. Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face. Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean. Wanted to talk to my son. In the war. Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they? Their kids was born here. So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it. Carl held it for 'em. Called it a lease. They make payments every June and December... They fished t'gether. Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person. Like any friend. Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first. You done your math right. Is that your third question? A thousand. Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.You're implying th... It seems human. To me. We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To come forward seemed like a mistake. Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks. Even though they should be. They're about what people believe is true. Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder. We discussed that. And decided not to. Yes, and then, what was there to call about? Everything was up in the air. Of course not. We're just not quick to run and boast. In case something went wrong. Closer to eight. We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later. Happy for him. And relieved. I said 'excited'. Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed. It's not for the. They only get to convict him. Did you write that column? You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael. Not once, not ever. There's no half- way. As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go. I'm married, Ishmael. It isn't right for us to be alone. People will t... I'm sorry about your arm. Kabuo and I. Are very sor... I don't mean everyone. Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them. Or run a newspaper. Look at my face. It's the face of the people who did that. My father hardly speaks English. We're in bad trouble, you have to see that. My father can't get our money from the bank. We have a few dol... I lie to my parents every day. And every night. I can just feel my spirits soar. My mom. Would be the problem. We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword. Easy. Slow is best. He's still got a good grip. We need to dig more.Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it. Nightmares, tears, b... They're not his neighbor, like you are. He is a husband, a father, he risked his life for their country. The same as you. They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese. You've been busy with that trial, I suppose. Such a travesty... You don't believe in God anymore.Oh, in a heartbeat. What else? I had the boy teach me kendo. Including...the importance of the bow. More than eager. He was out to make a point. It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years. They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.That's all he said. Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore. I can't speak for him. He had no reason to. Carl never lied. Not in those words. I wouldn't say encouraged.
