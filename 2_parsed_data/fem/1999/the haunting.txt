What happened? This is where we're going? What's this? What's this... this picture? Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for. And they all score high on the insomnia charts. How'd I know it was for you? Test it. You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this? You know what he's really upset about?No one could. No one lives any nearer than town. -- no one could. No one lives any nearer than town. No one will come any nearer than that. In the night. In the dark. It's a job. I keep banker's hours. I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six. You can serve yourselves. Breakfast is ready at nine. I don't wait on people. I don't stay after dinner. Not after it begins to get dark. I leave before dark comes. We live in town. Nine miles. So there won't be anyone around if you need help. We couldn't even hear you, in the night. I've seen 'em. Lot to dust. So far. It's make the soup or answer the door. Can't do both.Is this true? I've been hypnotized? Welcome Home Eleanor. Welcome Home? I've never been here. Who did this? Couldn't get the last ones. You? The children. The children Hugh Crain built the house for. The children he never had. I only saw Theo drive up. Well, I... uh... Uh... Nell Vance... Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us. Don't get in the way, please. No -- My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her. Then who called me? But you told me to look in the paper! You told me I'd be perfect! The children want me. They're calling me. They need me. Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills! Because that's where their bones are! He killed <i>hundreds</i>. He took them here and he killed them. Their bones are in the fireplace! It's not real? Crain? He's not real? And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them! I don't know. A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on. Hugh Crain, would you care to dance? It doesn't matter. Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me. What I do with this is up to me. I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer. And I want to be the volunteer. Why? Sure. Welcome Home. It was a stupid thing to do. Let's say it wasn't you. Who did it? Are you coming to confess? I'm sorry. I'm messing up the study. I got more scared. Yes. I looked at Theo. She had a look on her face. I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom. In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table. It smelled like that wood. It was very specific. That smell... oh, God. Sorry. Theo I think. You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on? All the carvings. Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake. Ever since I was little. That was my job. I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time. And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit. I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this. I'm really happy to be here with you. I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim. You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow. Why? Yes. Why? Who? Is there something about the house? Why do you need a chain like that? I'm with Dr. Marrow's group. I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house. Is she here? Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker? Oh! You scared me. No one will come any nearer than that. Why would we -- Well, I've never lived with beauty. You must love working here. They're so beautiful. Aren't they? Mrs. Dudley. Oh, Theo. You know I don't have an apartment. Just had to be sure. They're all in here. All the ones he killed. They're just children! We have to help them! I don't think I want any. -- but the painting! This is real, I'm not making it up! Theo, you saw it! You were there -- the banging and last night. You, you all saw the painting! Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed -- Because I don't want to ruin things. Because home is where the heart is. -- What do you think? I think so. I'm trying. Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things. I don't know, you know... I'll take that as a compliment. In the city, what kind of place do you live in? I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo. Red. What else? I've never had a pedicure before. I don't know what to think anymore. There's hundreds of them. This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said. Why? Theo... Did you? No, it's getting worse. David? David? David Watts? Can you hear us? David! Daviiiiid! What's his first name? How could he have left without his keys? Yes. I feel realy rested, too. Theo? You know it wasn't a joke, Theo. Good night, Theo. Yes. I've missed it. A monster? But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal. I love this house. I really love this house. I know. I don't have anyone. But I do have a little apartment of my own. It has a little flower garden. You can just see the ocean. At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor. No. Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment. Not really. I'm between jobs right now. My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over. So... And you? That's why we're here. I don't know what you mean. It's all I could afford. Fifteen dollars. This? It's from a thrift shop.Nell! Was sure she'd be in here. Nell -- Will the two of you shut up! God damn it! Maybe the tests were right, Marrow. She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her. Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices. Maybe someday. Yeah. That depends on your definition of ghosts. I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake. We're fucked. We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning. Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you? No. You could have. He must have left. Didn't like the looks of the place or something. Luke. And why didn't Marrow tell us ? Doesn't he trust women? That fuck. The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me. I'm alone. Nobody's talking to me but myself. My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think. But the experiment was a failure. I'm not going back to New York City. I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor. What about you? Oh God, we can't get out! He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him. She thought it was ghosts. Let's go look for him again. She needs help. Yes. But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night. How could you do this to people? It's okay... we're all here... Maybe they're Mary's. Well this is a cozy breakfast. When do we take the tests? No, but Nell's been here longer than I have. Then let's go get you one. What'd you come back for, babe? Come on! Why are we waiting? I do. I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep. And then I'm going to get some brandy. Nell, it makes sense. It all makes sense. You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up. Nell, what happened? Then who is? Come on, Nell. Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second? Why wouldn't you be afraid? Really afraid. Marrow said the same thing as last night, he says -- -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley. And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney. He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current -- Okay. Are you sure? My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea. It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls. Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell. Do you know what I mean? You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me? I have a loft. Me too. Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself. You can be a pretty decent bitch. Well? Just think about one thing right now: What color? Well, it wasn't me. Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and... You said the Good Doctor was with you. Before he painted your name over Mister Crain. That's so sad. I don't know. You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention. Maybe he did it... Maybe you did it yourself. Is it over? Maybe he never came in. If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right? Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell. Maybe he's outside. David. Watts? Two sets. I don't know. Maybe they're not even his. I guess. Oh, your hair! It looks good. If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him. You, too. Happy tossing and turning. No. The world has missed you. You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you? The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb. Why didn't he tell us? You're okay. Jeez. A blank canvas! I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live? My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't. If we could all live together... but... they hate each other. It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party. D'you know what I mean? Don't tell me Boston is different from New York. That depends. What do you do? Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much. Light sleeper. Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you? That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it! What did it cost? And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
