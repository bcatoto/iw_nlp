In the backyard. I heard them. What's that outside, Daddy? Can I go over to Janeane's house? I'll take some. She was playing with the Pooh doll. She was playing with my Pooh doll again... Okay. For reading. Ms. Laufer gave me a star today. Hi, Daddy. There's Dad, on TV. Mom. Yeah. He's into kind of little cars, that...The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower." Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on... Yeah, Don's looking for you... Okay. Hold on a second... What is it? Sure. What was that about? Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3. Alright, alright. I don't know what he was thinking. What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement? What does that do? Okay.Oh, I love that stuff. What are you cooking? Maybe later. Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...Mike... Mike... Mike... Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS. If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk. Are you sure? Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late. You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen. They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller. Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage. Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else... And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity. I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.Yes, baby? Alright, we'll do that tomorrow. That remote control thing? I'm cooking pasta primavera. How about you? Do you want more rice? ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after... Yes... Jeffrey. I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry... That's for food. Use the bathroom. Please don't wash your hands in the sink. An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry. ...taping? What are you taping? I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you... No, thank you. What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house? Why? Who said? I don't understand. Why did you take your stuff from the office? Right now? What do you need at the store? Uh, what are those boxes? I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...? Yes, it's on the stove... Don't you have to be at the office?You're not listening. Really know what you're going to do before you do it. No, you do not. Get some perspective, Lowell. So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else. Jeffrey Wigand... Oh, baby... What are you and Mike going to do? What?! What's wrong? I have to take a shower. ...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from? Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow. Hello? Yeah... No classes this morning? It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
