Dr. Homer Wells. Wilbur, he picked them for us himself... These credentials are against the law! You invented him! You've completely made his up! This is your life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates! It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur. Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes. Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man. He'll need clothes... some money... They just want you to hire some new help. It was just the ether, Wilbur... Then I wasn't beautiful. You weren't dreaming about me. Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office. It claims to restore monthly regularity. Only if you can afford it.Good night, Daddy. Daddy, please ... Good night, Daddy. Wally said to say, "Hello." Daddy, it's a letter to me . It's time somebody ate them . No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry. I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter... This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot. Do you think she'll be all right? You say that as though it's some awful thing! I never stopped loving Wally! Please don't... Please... that's enough. I loved you, too--you know I did. Please don't make me say it again. What do you want me to do ? He's paralyzed ! For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down! Stop it! Just cut it out! If you're trying to be funny, Homer... Please don't move, don't go anywhere. No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing. Don't even look at me. I want... No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too. Nothing. We've got to keep her away from that bastard! He's the father ! He's her baby's father! You don't understand! It's her father... She won't go to St. Cloud's! Well, we have to help her! We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there... It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it? No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I know I do. I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him. Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just teasing you? Do you think I know whether I want you or Wally? Olive told me. You might have told me yourself. We have to wait and see. I think that, for everything in life, you have to wait and see. It will be okay. I know this was right. Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges. Not with the right girl you wouldn't. You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't come here to watch the movie. The speaker . For the movie sound. Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally. Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies. Just a little privacy. But you had so much responsibility . You don't miss it? At least you were never lonely. What are you so crazy about the movies for? Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie. You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this. Well, she was in a weakened condition... I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible? She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart. She did love him! How many women have you known? But you looked as if you liked it. You've seen only one movie? Which one? When they watched at all. Do you like movies? Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout. I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you. You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then. When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone. Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I... ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet. So. Not bored yet? I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything. I'm a little worried about the... ...about how much bleeding is okay. I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back! Burma! He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him! Really? No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman. Two. Candy. Candy Kendall. You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's Muddy ! Is it Muddy? Why? I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you... Yes, I have ! Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago. I've been through this. I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me. Hi... Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places... He thinks people like to get whacked by branches. You've been giving him a flying lesson! I know what you've been doing. I love you, Wally. There! You said it was boring. You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying." Wally thinks apples are boring. No--keep it down. I want to feel the air. I'm okay--I can walk. So many children. Are they all orphans?You mean somebody asked? Nobody's asked for me, have they? Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take any of us! Nobody ever wants me! I thought they might take me.Does he know he's supposed to be in India? Does he even want to come back? I just wanted to ask you... He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too. But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any diplomas ... You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions. Homer was born here , in, what was it, 1922? He's leaving... That's a heavy sedation. Her temperature is a hundred and four.I must have been dreaming of kissing someone. Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me. I don't remember.I fail to see how a little Christianity could hurt anyone here! You can't think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow -- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is? I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here. Do you know him?They're outrageous , them rules! They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree! It look nicer then home! We see you next harvest. Sorry, Homer... Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer? They told Muddy his feet was too flat! He ain't never been outta Maine! She took off in the night! The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for swimmin' ... That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just... I can't go nowhere. You ain't been through what I been through, Candy. I don't need no more clothes, thank you. Hi... How is that Wally doing? It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been wonderin' about it! That's it ? Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself! You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going nowhere . Happy ! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby. Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business. Not yet. What do you know about it? I guess you must like watchin' me be sick... Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer? Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is. You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope. I can't read. Nobody taught me. So what? What you got a picture of your heart for? What's that? Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber? That's right, Homer. This ain't your business. I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go. You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please... You just stay out of trouble, Homer! Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off him was his clothes! We should drown that damn Jack in the vat! That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer. What's lucky about that? Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes every night.
