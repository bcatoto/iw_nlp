I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer. I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess! I gotta work with these women. Loretta, don't do that. Airport Ho-Jo! There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh! I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons! It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God! Ah! It's from State! Oh my God! I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time. Okay. Really? I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this. ...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me. I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer... Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over. Loretta, never have kids. My mom wanted me to have this? Really, Loretta? Oh-yah. No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him. Oh my God. I'm so dead... So, what do I say? Oh God, I'm dead... I -- I'm quittin' the pageant. Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse! Where is she?! Is Mom okay? Yah? Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't. Your parents'd kill you. "Here," wh-wh-what? I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete. But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong... I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight. Mrs. Leeman? I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent. Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys." I'm gonna need more caps. No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head. -- red nose and ears. I know, I know. Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore. It's okay. Bye mom. I love you much. God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'. That's it, I'm goin'... Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary. Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again. Ow! Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant. Mom! Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant. Oh, Mom, it's so ugly. They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie. That's my mom. I'll get 'em in a sec. ...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times. Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany! This, this... This is bullshit! But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule? Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on? I hate her! No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it? Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone. Bitch! Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds. Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on. I just did. You heard me. Where is it? What're you doin' here? Yes, Leslie! Yes... Yeah... Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy. Here, I didn't get any. Bye. Yah-sure, fine... fine. I know. Then it must be Wednesday. Here, I'll take it. It's my job. Hi.We was robbed. C'mere. I love you so much. It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber. Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you... Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day. You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels. Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too. What?! I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails. Go on! Get out! Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons. Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed. Oh... How quickly they grow up. Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first. Oh shit! Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes? They told me to practice. We was robbed. Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant! If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU! Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over. Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down. You don't know where this is gonna... They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it. I'll be right back. See ya later. "Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home. Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta. Shut it up, Loretta. Loretta, shut it. This here's Loretta. It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em. Hi. You could be quiet. Oh, Jesus H. Christ!If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya. Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch! Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy. If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it. What? Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary. My dress'll reek. It smells funny. Like gasoline. Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!The bitch. Wisconsin. That bitch from... Dakota. People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota... Mm-hm. That's right. Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too. Yeah. Girls check in, but they don't check out. Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win. ...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.Oh really -- I don't think so. Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this... This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience. Huh? Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'. Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth. Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico. C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now. She's the winner and we're going to state. "Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'. "U.S.A. is A-okay." Last year? It was, "Buy American." Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls -- Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS! Becky was my only shot at state! Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha! Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire! Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street? Sammy Davis, Jr., honey. Lester? We're not in the showroom, Dear. Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know. I swear to God she can't do anything by herself. This is -- what? What! Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan. Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers. So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview... You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan. Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young. "Proud... to be... an... American." I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits. You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America! Iris, stop! It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them. Oh, my! Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks? Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme. ...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number -- ...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language! Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules. Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant. We all do. Now let's go. Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies. Okay, okay! Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal. Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine... Enid ate a whole pan! We need more bars! Uh, Gladys? Okay, everybody, listen up! Yeah. It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross. Oh! What is it? All right, let's go. It's a two-hundred dollar fine! Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry. That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ. Gladys -- Gladys! Look out! Nothin' too showy! A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs. And the bite marks on my ears? Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck? So, anyone talk to Janelle? Here, have some.Oh-you-beccha. Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back. Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney. Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me. My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it. Amber? Here. I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't... Oh, Amber...Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out! Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go. I'm sorry. They're just starin'. I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a... All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo." Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber... What? For chrissakes, spit it out. This came for you, sweetie. Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'. No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float. You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people. What is wrong with you? Thank God for bunge cords. Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could. Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep. You-betcha. That was your mom. She wanted you to have this. "Once a carnie, always a carnie." Hell-no, she ain't quittin'. Yeah, you betcha... Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie. I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart! You're what?! Don't let that worry you, Annette! She's right over there. She's alive, sweetie. Annette, just use your hand. Okay. Take her purse. Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit. Anyone? So? Be real easy. I got a hairdo. All right, they're makin' a movie. Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here. Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know... She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest... Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber. Oh, Christ, it's true. Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need. Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's? I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall." You guys want a beer? Oh, naw. Hi. Hi. Are we on "Cops" again? What do you mean, they take out her butt?I wonder how she's gonna fix that one. Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health. This pageant's like a roach motel. Tammy Curry?Oh, I almost forgot... I got my acceptance to Tokyo University. Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it? I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko. Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
