Who's fault is it then if it's not  yours? You're the one in charge,  Daddy. Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out. I don't care. They're out. Why do they do that? You know. Yeah. It's stupid. Did you do that when you were a kid? Was it funny? But it's not funny now. I bet you did lots of bad things. I just think you used to be bad. No. She doesn't talk about you  anymore. I don't want to. It's not that. It's stupid. I want to go home. I don't like it here. No. No I didn't see anybody I know. No I  don't want to go to school here  tomorrow. I want to go home. I don't want to be here. Don't worry,  I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want  to go home. I called Mommy. Yes. I... because I want to go home. She  said she'd come and get me. See, I knew you'd be mad. I told her I wanted to come home.  Daddy, don't be mad at me. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's fine with me too. When Mommy  comes, tell her I'm up here. What's wrong with you? What? What's she up here for? Where's Jill? Where is she now? Is she in the truck  with your friends? While you went off for a few beers  with your friends? Is that Hettie  Rodgers there, with whatzizname? She's grown up some, hasn't she? Don't cause a scene. No one's trying  to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it  any worse. New hat? Jill's up, I see. How's she doing? You two want to do anything tomorrow  and need a third party, give me a  call, okay? I'm off. Well, that's that. Don't worry. I can protect my virtue.  I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break. You okay? Who needs it? Everybody who comes  here has been coming for years so  what they need a sign for? You okay? I'm sorry about what I said. About you and Jill and needing a  third person. She went back to  Lillian? I'm sorry. You don't mean that. No you don't. You're pissed, that's  all. You ought to cool off for a few  days then have a long talk with  Lillian. You know? Work it out with  her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's  not out to get you. Call me. Okay. Stop being jealous. Who are you? He's asleep. We were up very late. Mrs. Gordon. Thank you. Something about my father? Can't it wait, then? Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead. I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.' What the hell are you talking about? Moving violation! I just got out of  bed and you're telling me you're  giving me a goddamn speeding ticket?  Now? Are you nuts? Is that it,  Whitehouse? You're nuts? Hold on! You're talking about a goddamned  ticket, from when I passed you at  the school where you were deciding  to hold up traffic while dreaming of  becoming a traffic cop or something? Doing your fucking job. I know. I  watch television too. You get the hell out of my house  now, asshole. And know this -- you  are going to be a lucky asshole if I  haven't got you fired before the day  is out. I can do it with one phone  call, and I'm pissed enough to do it  now! Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess.  More than most. But he'll be okay in  a few weeks. I heard he was drunk at Toby's last  night and got in a fight with Hettie.  He drove off without her... ...Jack's turned into one of those  men who are permanently angry. He  used to be a sweet kid, but it's  like, when he found out he couldn't  play ball anymore, he changed. Now  he's like everyone else. Wade! How can you even think such a  thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that,  shoot Twombley on purpose? Jack doesn't need money. Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides,  who would pay him? The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt? You wouldn't have done anything like  that, shot someone for money. But not now. When you gonna get that tooth fixed? You knew me as a kid. What way? It's nice. Don't you think, do you still think  it's a good idea to press this custody  thing -- just now? Then... I guess you have to. Oh, Wade. You've been married twice -- Alright. I'll think about it. Glen, stop -- Don't! Glen, stop! Did you tell them? That we were coming? I know your parents. Are you sure they're home? Did you  call? Think they're alright? How? Have you been heating the house? Not  just with the stove. You're not using it today? Maybe Wade should take a look at it.  Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that? When did she die? Can --? They'll be at the church and the  cemetery. Come, Glen, join us. Let's kneel for  a moment of prayer before the service.  Wade? Rolfe? Wade. Dear Heavenly Father, Lord of Hosts,  we come to Thee to beseech Thy  blessings and commend to You the  soul of our beloved wife and mother,  Sally Whitehouse, to be one with You  and walk with You -- This is a difficult time. Give up this demon. Dad. No, not anymore. It's too... it's  too far. We've done all our talking, Wade. Let the past be. I'm sorry about your mother. I liked  her. You never know how much women  like that suffer. It's like they  live their lives with the sound turned  off -- and then they're gone. Mom. She has an ice-skating lesson at  four. I'm taking ice-skating, Daddy! Mr. Gordon! The boss in? Yes indeedy! What! What happened? There's clothes in the back. I can't. Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it! Wade! Come in! Have a cup of coffee. Been putting my files into it. You  take sugar and milk? Are you alright, Wade? Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't  mean to pry. I'm sorry about your  mother. It was a nice funeral. Always has been. Who? Who? Sometimes things are simpler than  you think. Let me ask you a question. About Jack? No. Have you checked out  the tax bill on your father's farm  lately? Has anybody offered to buy it? This is all the real estate  transactions in this town the last  year. Most of it unused land. Most  of it for little more than the back  taxes owed. This is from three years ago. Some  difference, huh? I went down to Concord to check it  out. The president is Mel Gordon.  The vice-president and treasurer is  Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are  buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000  this year. I believe that's out of  LaRiviere's league. No. All the figures show is that Gordon  LaRiviere is going to be a very rich  man using his position as Selectman.  In a year or two, you won't recognize  this town. What on earth is happening to you?  Why are you acting this way? I heard you talking. You got fired  this morning, didn't you? Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in  Lawford? See. Get your boots. Hi. Have her back tomorrow night by six. You make me sick. I can't believe  you've sunk so low. You know what I'm talking about. For  what you're doing to me and to the  child you say you love so much. Love.  You won't get away with it. Bye, honey! Call me tonight if you  want. Are we going in this? It's pretty old. Pop? Oh. Mommy won't let me eat fast food.  You know that. It's bad for you. No. Nothing. Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says -- Okay. So we'll get what you want.  What do you want? Okay. What are you sorry for? I want to go home. That's illegal, you know. You're a policeman. Oh. I want to go home. I'm just cleaning out some of this  stuff that's built up. For the rummage  sale. And some things for the  cleaners. And the laundromat. Don't be silly. Hi, Jill. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Get in. I want to go home. Will you take me  home? Yes.
