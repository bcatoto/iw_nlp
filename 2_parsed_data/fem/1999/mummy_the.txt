You must go. Save yourself. Only you  can resurrect me. My body is no longer his temple! I knew this was gonna be a lousy  day. Shut-up and gimme your bandolier. Now gimme your revolver, you'll never  use it anyway. Now go find me a big stick. So I can tie it to your back, you  appear to be without a spine. How'd a guy like you end up in the  Legion anyways? Altar boys? No, but I'm considering it. None of the above, thank you. I was just looking for a good time. Oh shit. Steady! STEADY! STEADY!! FIRE! FIRE! FIRE! Son-of-a-bitch. Hey! Beni! Wait up! What are ya doing?! Wait up! Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU I'm gonna get you for this! Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up  here? OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH! Oops. I'm sorry, it was an accident. You put up with me, because I can  read and write ancient Egyptian,  decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic,  and I'm the only person within a  thousand miles who knows how to  properly code and catalogue this  library. Hello? Abdul? Mohammed? Bob? You...! YOU...! Have you no respect for the dead? Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather  than later, before you ruin my career  the way you've ruined yours. High note? Ha! For five years you've  been scrounging around Egypt, and  what have you to show for it? Nothing. Oh no, not another worthless trinket,  Jonathan, if I bring one more piece  of junk to the Curator to try and  sell for you. Where did you get this? Jonathan? I think you found something. See the cartouche there, it's the  official royal seal of Seti the First,  I'm sure of it. He was the last Pharaoh of the Old  Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest  Pharaoh of them all. I've already dated it, this map is  almost four thousand years old. And  the hieratics over here... It's Hamunaptra. Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the  early Pharaohs were said to have  hidden the wealth of Egypt. All we know is that the city  mysteriously vanished around 2,134 You told me you found it on a dig  down in Thebes! You lied to me! I'm your sister. You stole it from a drunk at the  local Casbah?! And what is he in prison for? And what did he say? But he's just a filthy criminal? So who's the broad? Broad?! Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a  total loss. I tremble with anticipation. We uh,... found... your puzzle box,  and we've come to ask you about it. No. No? No... You came to ask me about  Hamunaptra. How do you know the box pertains to  Hamunaptra? Because that's where I found it. I  was there. Hey,... don't I know you? You were actually at Hamunaptra? I just decked your brother Yes, well... I know my brother. Yeah, I was there. You swear? Every damn day. No, I mean -- -- I know what you mean. I was there,  alright. Seti's place. The City Of  The Dead. What did you find? What did you see? I found sand. I saw death. Could you tell me how to get there?  The exact location? Want to know? Yes. Really want to know? Yes. Then get me the hell outta here. Where are they taking him? I am an English woman. I will give you one hundred pounds  to spare his life. Two hundred pounds. Three hundred pounds! Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go. FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS! NOOO! He knows the location to Hamunaptra. I would never! Yes and if you cut him down, we will  give you ten percent. Twenty. Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- Twenty-five percent, and not one  single farthing more. Do you really think he'll show up? Personally, I think he's filthy,  rude and a complete scoundrel. I  don't like him one bit. Anyone I know? Oh... um,... hello. Yeah, sure, smashing. Mister O'Connell, can you look me in  the eye, and guarantee me this is  not some sort of flimflam? Because  if it is, I'm warning you -- All I can tell you, miss, is that my  Colonel found that map in an ancient  fortress, and the whole damn garrison  believed in it so much, that without  orders, we marched halfway across  Libya and into Egypt to find that  city. Like I told ya, all I saw was  sand. Everybody else was wiped out  by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your  bags. What are you doing here? I only gamble with my life, never my  money. Yer on. What makes you? Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya. The only thing that scares me, Mister  O'Connell, are your manners. Still angry that I kissed ya, huh? If you call that a kiss. Did I miss something? Are we going  into battle? The last time I was at that place  everybody I was with died. There's something out there, you  know, something under that sand. Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain  artifact, a book, actually, my brother  thinks there's treasure. What do you  think is out there? Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin  believe that Hamunaptra is cursed,  they call it, "the doorway to hell." Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to  the underworld", actually. I don't believe in fairy tales and  hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do  believe that one of the most famous  books in history is buried out there,  The Book Of The Living. It's what  first interested me in Egypt as a  child. It's why I came here, sort of  a life's pursuit. And the fact that they say it's made  out of pure gold, makes no nevermind  to you, right? You know your history. I know my treasure. By the way,... why did you kiss me? I was about to be hanged, seemed  like a good idea at the time. What?... Wha'd I say? Why if it ain't my little buddy,  Beni. I oughta kill you. So you're the one leading the  Americans, I shoulda figured. So  what's the scam? You get 'em out in  the middle of the desert then leave  'em to rot? The girl saved my life, figured it  was the least I could do, keep her  out of trouble. Let's make us even, shall we? Sounds familiar. Friend of yours? The map! We need the map! Relax! I'm the map! It's all up here. Oh that's comforting. C'mon, there's still one more of  those guys around here somewhere. Can you swim? Well of course I can swim, if the  occasion calls for it. Trust me. The occasion calls for it. Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on  the wrong side of the river! We coulda had 'em for free, all we  had to do was give 'em your sister. Awfully. Then again... Yeah, disgusting. Well I think they're cute. We're almost there. Are you sure? Pretty sure. Get ready. For what? We're about to be shown the way. After all, you rode us night and day  to win that bet. Evelyn! Slow down! SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN! THERE'S Never mind. You boys owe me five hundred dollars. Be nice. That thing saved my life. That "thing" gets me excited. The things that get you excited. According to Bembridge Scholars,  inside the statue of Anubis was a  secret compartment, perhaps containing  The Book Of The Living. What are those mirrors for? Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see. Do you realize, we are standing inside  a room that no one has entered in  over four thousand years. You're welcome to my share of the  spider webs. Cretins. That is a neat trick. Oh my god, It's a preparation room. Preparation for what? For entering the afterlife. Likewise. Don't see your name on it,... pal. I've had worse. Let's be nice, children, if we're  going to play together, we must learn  to share. According to my calculations, we  should be right under the statue.  We'll come up right between his legs. Oh my. None taken. And you're sure you can find the  secret compartment? Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't  already found it. Lemme get this straight, they stuck  a sharp, red hot poker up your nose,  cut your brain into small pieces,  then ripped it all out through your  nostrils? It's called mummification. You're  dead when they do this Yeah, that'd bring you back to life. You two are worse than a couple of  schoolboys. Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks  like a sarcophagus. Why would they bury somebody in the  ceiling? They didn't, they buried him at the  foot of Anubis. He was either someone  of great importance. Or he did  something very naughty. 'He that shall not be named.' There's some sort of lock here. You  say these thing's are made of granite  with a steel interior? Quarried granite with a cobalt lining. No kiddin', without a key, it'll  take us a month to crack this thing, A key! That's it! That's what he was  talking about. Who was talking about what? The man on the barge. The one with  the hook, he was looking for a key. What do you suppose killed him? Seems the Americans had a little  misadventure of their own today,  three of their diggers were killed. How? Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.  Some sort of ancient booby-trap. You two! You don't believe in curses, huh? No. I believe if I can see it and I  can touch it, then it's real. That's  what I believe. I believe in being prepared. Stay here! Goin' somewhere? C'mon, friend. 'Cause I look good doin, it. LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE You alright? Yes,... fine,... thank you. These men are a desert people. They  value water, not gold. Where's Jonathan? Unlike my brother, sir, I know when  to say no. Unlike your brother, Miss, you I  don't get. You're a whole new brew. I know, you're wondering, what's a  place like me doing in a girl like  this? Something like that. Egypt is in my blood. My father was  a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so  much that he married an Egyptian. My  mother! Who was quite an adventurer  herself Okay, I get your father, I get your  mother and I get your brother, but  what are you doing here? I may not be an explorer, or an  adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or  a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But  I'm proud of what I am. And what is that? ...I am a librarian! I'm going to kiss you, Mister  O'Connell. No you're not. I'm not? Not unless you call me Rick. Why would I do that? Because that's my name. I can't believe I allowed the two of  you to get me drunk. Well neither do I, thank you. You don't? No... Why?... Should I? Gee, yeah, you told me it was the  best time you ever had. Oh my god, I've dreamed about this  ever since I was a little girl. You dream about dead guys? Look, all the sacred spells have  been chiseled off. The hieratics and  hieroglyphs that protect the deceased  on his journey into the afterlife,  they've been removed. This man was  cursed,... doomed. Tough break. Is he supposed to look like that? No. I've never seen a mummy look  like this. He's, he's still... Yes. He's more than four thousand  years old and still decomposing. And look at this. Oh my god, he was buried alive. And he left a message. It says: 'Death is only the  beginning.' Where's my gun? If he decides to wake up, hell yes! Rat gizzards. They smell bad and  taste worse, but that's the best the  desert has to offer. Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them  inside our friend's coffin. They can  stay alive for years living off the  flesh of a corpse, or in this case... Famished. Are you saying somebody threw these  things in with our guy, and they  slowly ate him alive? Very slowly. Must of got a little too frisky with  the Pharaoh's daughter. According to my readings, our friend  suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of  all ancient Egyptian curses, one  reserved for only the most evil  blasphemers. In all of my research,  I've never read of this curse actually  having been performed. That bad huh? Yes, they never used it because they  feared it so. It's written, that if  a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever  arise, he would bring with him the  ten plagues of Egypt. The ten plagues?... You mean all ten  plagues. That's one way of putting it. Fried gizzard anyone? You sure you outta be playin, around  with that? It's just a book, no harm ever came  from a book. Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei. That's one of the plagues, right?  The grasshopper plague! This is not a plague. It's  generational. Every so many years  the locusts of Egypt have a population  explosion and they all take flight. Okay,... and what about frogs? Oh thank goodness, you're one of the  Americans, aren't you? Damn-it! Must be a trap door around  here or somethin'. Help me,... please,... help me. Would you quit playin, around! Let's  get outta here already! WHOA! Ahhhhhhhh!! I told you to leave or die, you  refused, and now you may have killed  us all. For you have unleashed the  creature that we have feared for  more than four thousand years. Relax, I got him. No mortal weapons can kill this  creature. He is not of this world. Are we talkin, about the same  creature? The walking corpse? Really  big mouth? Really bad breath? We saved him! Saved him before the  creature could finish his work. Now  leave, all of you, quickly, before  he finishes you all. We must now hunt him down, and try  and find a way to kill him, before  he consumes the earth. Allah be with  us. I told ya, I already got him! Know this, the creature will be coming  for you. He must consummate the curse.  And until he does, he will never  eat, he will never sleep, and he  will never stop. I thought you didn't believe in this  stuff!? Having an encounter with a four  thousand year old walking-talking  corpse tends to convert one. Forget it, we're out the door down  the hall and gone. No, we are not. Oh yes we are. No we are not. We woke him up, and  we must try and stop him. We?! What we?! You didn't read that  book. I told you not to play around  with that thing. Alright then, Me, I,... I read the  book, I woke him up and I intend to  stop him. How!? You heard the man, no mortal  weapons can kill this guy. Then we'll have to find some immortal  ones. There goes that belief again. Not  me, I am outta here! According to that Book, once this  creature has been reborn, his curse  will spread, and as he grows in  strength, so will his curse grow,  infecting the people until the whole  of the earth is destroyed. Yeah? So? Is that my problem? It's everybody's problem! Look lady, I appreciate you saving  my life and all, but when I signed  on, I agreed to take you out there  and bring you back, and I did, now  were even, end of job, end of story,  contract terminated. That's what I am to you? A contract? You can either tag along with me, or  you can stay here and play around  with Mister Maggot. I'm staying. FINE. Beni ya little stinkweed, where did  you slink off to? Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. So who's this guy? Oh, hey, how ya doin'? Yeah, well, we all got our little  problems today don't we? Don't gimme that, you never had any  scruples. See ya around, Padre. I've heard it before, Winston. Blood. He's here. The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY! Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!! We got problems. He's here! I saw him! That thing is  here! The creature!? Are you sure!? Pretty sure! We are in serious trouble. Back off, creep. There's only one person I know who  can possibly give us some answers. What is he doing here? I just saw my fist vanish into some  guy's head. I'm willin, to go on a little faith,  here. Try me. And because of you, we have failed. And you think this justifies killing  innocent people!? Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's  afraid of cats, what's that about? Anck-su-namun. In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns'  quarters he tried to kiss me. Tonight is the full moon. The moon  of Osiris. It will begin tonight. We must stop him from regenerating. Who opened that chest? What about my buddy, Beni? We must find the Egyptologist and  bring him back here to the safety of  the fort, before the creature can  get to him. Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you  two come with me. Who put you in charge? You can't  just leave me behind like some old  suitcase. I'm the one responsible  for this mess and I intend to be the  one to clean it up. Keep an eye on her. If you leave her  door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon,  Jonathan. Well, well, well. Lemme guess, spring cleaning? Where's your new friend? Then you got no excuse for living.  What the hell you doin, being buddies  with this creep, Beni? What's in it  for you? Immune from what? What are you looking for? Lie, and  I'll slit your throat. What does he want the book for? Ya know, ever since I met you, my  luck has been for crap. Damn-it! That's two down and only  two to go. Get your hands off my girl, pal. Nice lips. I figured you might be here, so I  brought a friend. You called me your girl? What?... Oh yeah, that was just um,  you know, figure a speech. I think you were jealous Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see  that guy's face? Last month I came across an  inscription that mentioned The Book  Of The Dead. Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked  about bringing people back from the  dead. A notion I was unwilling to  believe. Believe it, sister. That's what  brought our buddy back to life. And if he succeeds, the two of them  together will bring about the  apocalypse. I'm thinking that if the black Book  Of The Dead can bring people back to  life -- Exactly -- So your sayin', if we find the book  made outta gold -- You think it'll send this guy back  to hell? It has begun. The beginning of the  end. Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon. Got it! Got what? Since the black Book of The Dead was  found inside the statue of Anubis,  then according to this, the golden  Book of The Living should be inside... What? The golden Book Of The Living, is  inside the statue of Horus. Don't tell me we gotta go back out  there? You're gonna get yours, pal! C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go! He's gorgeous. Any bright ideas? Sorry, fresh out. Don't do it, Evelyn. I have no choice. All eternity, idiot. You better think of something, because  if he turns me into a mummy, you're  the first one I'm coming after. Got guts, lady. Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep  them. Evelyn! Be calm. There is still time. We can  stop him yet. NOOO!! EVELYN! We gotta get her back. You know where he's taking her? Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the  ritual. The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life. By reading the Book Of The Dead. And then killing your sister. Imhotep is now able to cross the  desert with great haste. If he arrives before us, it will be  too late. I know how to beat him to it. Not a god-damned thing. You probably won't live through it. To save the damsel in distress, kill  the bad guy and steal his treasure. What just happened? Stop it! You'll kill them! Okay, now what the hell does this  Horus guy look like? Got it. You know, nasty little fellows such  as yourself, always get their  comeuppance. Oh yes, always. From now on, don't touch anything.  Not a damn thing. Keep your hands  off the furniture, got it? Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but  that it's already taken. Intestines. You only want me for my organs?! Who the hell are these guys? Priests. Imhotep's priests. I never killed a priest before. They are evil, cursed, they matter  not. Well, okay then. Oh come on, gimme a break here. My turn. This whole place is comin, alive! I'm out. Allow me. These guys just don't quit. Keep digging! Save the girl! Kill the creature! That's the last one, we better get  lucky. Shut-up and get me off of here! Open the book, Jonathan! Open the  book! That's the only way to kill  him! Read the inscription on the cover! This just keeps gettin, better and  better. Do something, Jonathan! Kill it! Finish the inscription, idiot! What's it look like!? Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus! Okay pal, let's see how tough you  are without your right arm. Alright,... so he's left handed. Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! Death is only the beginning. C'mon! Wouldn't say that.
