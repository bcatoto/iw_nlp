What are you doing? You don't stop here ...  Thank you, Irene. I was so excited and nervous. It was sure great to have you to talk to.  Now, remember I'll be watching for you on the big screen.  Okay Irene. Won't that be the day.  The best of luck to you, Betty. Take care of yourself and be careful.  Okay I will. Thanks again.  1612 Havenhurst.  I am, Mrs. Lanois. It is Mrs. Lanois isn't it?  In all my living glory, baby.  Pleased to meet you.  You can call me Coco ... everybody does. Stay there, I'll get the key.  Okay, Coco.  Yes, he is. He raises corn.  Well, I ...  I...  Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.  I guess I've come to quite a place.  No, I don't.  I can hardly wait, Coco.  It's unbelievable!  Wow!  Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.  Oh my!  That's okay.  I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.  There was an accident. I came here.  I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?  A car ... a car accident.  Are you okay?  I think so. I was just taking a shower.  Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.  My name is Rita.  Hi...do you work with my Aunt?  No ..........I.  I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.  She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.  She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.  I think I've been hurt.  Oh...  No.  But, this could be serious.  No...I need to sleep.  If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.  It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.  All right, but...I'm going to check on you.  No Grandpa, you wouldn't believe it. It's more beautiful than I ever dreamed ... no she left me a lot of food. The refrigerator's full ... Aunt Ruthie said she'd call me when she got settled... it was real smooth. I sat next to a lady who gave up her first class seat to a boy with a broken leg. She was so nice to me. She invited me to her house sometime. It's in Bel Air which is a place where people have a lot of money... I will. Everybody's telling me to be careful, but I sure love it here Grandpa. Thank you for helping me get here ... yeah, it's long distance. I love you. Say hello to Grams. Give her a big kiss for me. Okay, I love you Grandpa ... bye.  I'm... sorry. I ...  What is it Rita?  I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...  What's wrong?  I don't know who I am.  What do you mean? You're Rita.  I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!  This is your purse. Your name must be in your purse.  I ... yes, but ... I ...  Open it!  Who is it please?  Not here...no thanks.  No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.  No.  I haven't seen any.  No...  Sure.  Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?  What do you mean?  Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?  Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.  How do you remember how to talk?  I don't know.  You don't remember anything else?  No There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it. There are things there.... but I'm... here.  The money. You don't know where it came from?  Unh, unh.  When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?  The money... I don't know about the money... the key... it makes me feel ... afraid.  Adam Kesher's office.  She's on the set. I'll connect you Mr. Kesher.  Paul, I have Mr. Kesher for Cynthia.  Adam, where are you?  They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.  They fired everyone.  Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!  You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.  Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!  Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.  I wonder where you were going.  Mulholland Drive.  Mulholland Drive?  That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.  Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.  No.... I don't...  We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.  Okay... but just...just to see.  Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.  Okay.  Come on... let's find you something to wear.  It's terrible ... My Aunt dresses like Miss Marple. She's kind of a frumpy woman detective in British movies.  Now, you've done it!  What the hell are you even doing here?  That bastard!  WHAT.. ARE ... YOU ... DOING!!!???  Throw him out!  Hollywood Police Department please.  No, no, I just want the number.  I'm inquiring about an accident that happened last night on Mulholland Drive.  Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.  Can you tell me what happened?  Was anyone hurt?  There was an accident. He wouldn't tell me anything else, but that was your accident Rita. I just know it was. Maybe there's something about it in the papers. Come on I'll buy you a cup of coffee and we can see.  There's nothing?  Not that I can see.  You're welcome. Will that be all? You want your check?  Just the coffee. Rita, you want something?  No. Just the coffee.  We'll take our check.  Shhhh.  Thank you. Come in again.  You're welcome. We will.  I remember something... I remember something!   Strange to be calling yourself.  Maybe it's not me.  Call the number.  Hi ... this is me. Leave me a message.  It's not my voice ... but I know her.  Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.  Maybe...maybe ... maybe.  Yeah, right ... get lost!  Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!!  It's right about here on Sierra Bonita. That's not too far away.  What's wrong with that?  I'm not sure about this.  I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.  It'll be okay.  Where is Ruth?  Ruth's gone on a film. I'm her niece Betty.   Who are you?  Someone is in trouble. Who are you? Why are you in Ruth's apartment?  I'm her niece. She's letting me stay here. My name is Betty.  No it isn't. That's not it. That's not what she said. Something bad's happening. Where's Ruth?  I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are and I'm...  Where have you been Coco? God, I've been trying to find you all afternoon since 3:00 o'clock. That one is in my room and she won't leave. I want you to get her out. I want you to get her out now.  No, she said it was someone else in trouble.  Whoa!  I know.  Where are you Adam?  Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.  You're broke!  I know, but you're broke. Where are you?  Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?  Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.  Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.  It's been a very strange day.  Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.  Will you meet with him?  I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.  I'm just offering a place to stay.  Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.  "You're still here?"  "I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."  "Nobody wants you here!"  "Really?"  "My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."  "So... surprise"...  "I can call them... I can call my dad... "  "But you won't..."  "You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."  "You know what I want...it's not that difficult."  "Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "  "What about you? What will your dad think about you?"  "Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."  "Before what?"  "Before I kill you."  "Then they'd put you in jail."  Cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big emotion, "I hate you... I hate us both!"  But you are   Thank you dahling!  Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?  I'm all right.  You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.  Uh...Betty!?  I was afraid of that.  It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...  Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.  Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.  You're really something Coco...thank you.  Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?  Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!  I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.  Good luck!  When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.  Okay.  Sorry to trouble you, Coco.  No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.  Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing  Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.  Right. See ya.  To my audition.  Wally Brown.  No, we don't.  Yes, Sir.  Betty Elms.  Thank you... thank you very much.  Thank you.  My name is Betty Elms. I'm here to audition for... Mr. Brown  Yes.  Very pleased to meet you.  Why thank you, Wally. Hello Betty.  Pleased to meet you.  This is Nicki, my assistant.  Hi.  No, no, I'm fine.  Okay.  What?  Betty.  You're still here?  Nobody wants you here.  My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left.  I can call them... I can call my dad.  You're playing a dangerous game here. if you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work.  Get out... Get out before I call my dad. He trusts you... you're his best friend. This will be the end of everything.  Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...  Before I kill you.  I hate you... I hate us both!  I'm going to take her over there.  Big time!  Well, there it was.  Well, thank you.  Thank you, Wally. I'm sure you all have a lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.  Well come along, Betty.  Thank you again, Mr. Brown. It was nice meeting all of you.  Oh God, that was awful!  How about that Jimmy Katz?  Oh god! Jimmy Katz never had a day. Jimmy Katz never had a minute. Poor Wally.  They seem very nice to me, and Wally... Mr. Brown is a very close friend of my Aunt's, so. . .  Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong. I love Wally. I ought to. I was married to him for ten years.  Oh, man, are you kidding? I love this script! Where do I sign?  I know you will ... cause my manager's gonna bug you day and night ... me too.  Oh, you're just so cruel... don't forget me. I'm the girl that's going to play this part.  Oh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I promised a friend.  C'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of.  Sol?  Rita.  And what's your name?  Ask him who Sol is ...  Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!  But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.  You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.  It should be around here...  Don't stop!  What is it? What do you see?!  Those men in front, in the car.  Do you know them?!  No... but...  Keep going. Go around to the back.  Selwyn ... number 12.  Oh no ... don't.  Yes?  Diane?  Number 17.  But it said #12.  I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.  Well ... we'll leave her a note.  I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.  I guess you're not Diane.  I don't think...  C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.  No.  PUSH!!!  Rita... I know what you're doing.  What ... I..HAVE... to do.  I know what you have to do, but let me do it.  You look like someone else.  What are you doing?  You've been so good to me ... now we know why ... why I was so afraid. We know what kind of trouble I'm in. I shouldn't... ask you... I only have this to offer. I'll give you this if I can stay here for awhile. I don't know what else to do.  Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.  But I want to.  No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.  It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.  Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.  Here I am Hollywood! My name's Betty.  Here I am Hollywood! My name is ... Rita.
