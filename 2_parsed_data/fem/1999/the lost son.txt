I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow... You wouldn�t understand. I don�t know. Everyone�s dead... On... Once... Once... What are we... you going to do? My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil... And his drowning was arranged... The staff don�t know yet... I called my parents, told them everything... I just couldn�t take any more... They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned. No. Not us... Do you think we�d let him get away with the murder of my brother? He... He is dead! MY HUSBAND IS DEAD! Call my parents. They�ll tell you. Call them! What are you doing? You can�t. I... Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That�s when he hit me, and told me he�d killed my brother... �You don�t know what you�ve done,� he said. �We�re in deep trouble,� he said. �We,� he said. �We.� We�d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting... I didn�t intend it that way... It just happened. He heard from Laurence that you�d been back. That we�d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn�t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see... My husband didn�t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered... You seem to know what you�re talking about. Should I? Simplify and damn. Here we go again. Something like that. Something like that. I didn�t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard! Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright. ...We�re turning in circles. You splendid bastard... You bastard... Why do I feel I needn�t answer that? Good. Think what you like. But don�t presume to understand. I didn�t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just... Do you think we spoke about it? I�ve known for five years. He�s known I�ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn�t speak about... That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No. You�re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down... Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he�d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found... Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don�t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest... I didn�t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles. Leon could still have hung himself. If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don�t you accuse me of killing my brother? ...You-you spoke to him? Leon hung himself... Leon hung himself... Leon hung himself. My brother hung himself. No! How... When did you... Huh! Don�t you recall convincing me he had? You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it. Whatever the reason, I�m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out. You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you�d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you�re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right? Have you finished? Why... I don�t know what you�re talking about. You�re mad... You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I... Sorry? I... If you don�t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. There�s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you? I... Well, we�re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it�s late and with the funeral... I�m really sorry you were not called... When did you get back? Mr Lombard... Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes... Paul Lamont...? Yes... You woke me up... It�s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman? ...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet? Just a moment... Go ahead. Mr Lombard? You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard. W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard? Huh! Really? Hotels? Are we understood? I�m impressed. That information could have cost me �20,000. Who is Friedman? You lost my money? Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting. I still don�t buy your story but I figured it can�t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about. Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard? The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard. Laurence! No. You�re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you... Get out of my house. You�re fired, Mr Lombard. No. The question now is how long it�s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard. How dare you... You don�t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard? Oh no. You�ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard. Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he? Excuse me? What... What are you talking about? You... You found that at Leon�s? Disney! How inter... Anything is possible. Can it be that easy? Oh-oh! Touch�, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh? No. Don�t. You might get confused speaking of things you don�t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you�ve done what we are paying you for. For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that. I won�t comment on the time but you�ll understand if I don�t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. Perhaps it wasn�t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know. I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard. Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn�t want anyone to interfere with his �Art�! Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought. Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn�t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over �1,000 to get rid of him. That depends what you�re looking at. Now you know why you�re here, Mr Lombard. It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe. So, black coffee and a couple of crescents. I�m sorry, sir. Could you try that again? Crow what? Good morning, sir. How can I help you?Huh! And they say charity�s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah... Christ... You cannot walk away from this. You cannot. My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I�m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son. But he�s a good guy. He�ll listen to you. He won�t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay? ...I�m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that�s who I am. Do you get what I�m fucking saying, Mr Lombard? Damn it! You can�t fucking walk away from this! Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god�s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it? A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I�ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it�ll be too late. That-that won�t do. That�s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that�s the way... We�re both thinking the same thing, right? Italian? The Mafia...? So who... Who�s the man? Where is he? What...? Look, you don�t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn�t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who�s the guy? The Austrian? Have you found your man? Is that where he is? Oh. What... Yeah. Okay. What am I to do with the packages if... Don�t fall asleep with your hair wet. Right... Well, I�ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay? Okay. Goodnight then. A little too tight, eh? ...They were my son�s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy... I... There�s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you�re hungry. Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn�t I hear you right? Did you not enter this country illegally? It�s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn�t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you? How come you�re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do. What am I really looking at here, huh? Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise? Like you�ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round? No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy�s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard? A recent acquisition. We�ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard. I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat�s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back. There�ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it�s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee? I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won�t be for a couple of hours. You know where to look for your Austrian, right? There are over 4 million people in this city - why me? Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr... You don�t know why he�s come to Los Angeles? The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his? By your Austrian? Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can�t you go back there? Okay. The woman just can�t walk away... I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can�t you go to your Embassy? You... Jesus Christ! I can�t believe this... What�s coming now, eh? If I don�t pay all Hell�s gonna break loose, is that it? Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess. You want money, right? I�m fine standing, thank you. I don�t smoke. If you could get to the point... You�re a long way from home... May I ask where you�re from, Mr Lamont? Shit! Fuck! What�s fucking wrong with people! I�m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! No. You�re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there. Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit... Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say? Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh! That�s right. Where�s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero? If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed... Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney�s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...Yes. How did... Really? And how are you, eh? Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of... What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you? Your secretary, huh! Piss off! Well, I�m sorry. I... This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. I�ve got the week off and he�s come to stay. No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be. Maybe it�s there with... Hello there. How�s the flat. I cleaned... I came to feed your fish. I didn�t know... She�s pretty... See you, huh? Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that�s what they do to their employees, isn�t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people�s lives. Thanks for the lift! Oh no. I�m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true? Oh... We split up. So you haven�t seen the film, then? I don�t know. How many famous French film directors can there be? �La collectionoose�. It�s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It�s on TV tonight and as I�m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it�s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director�s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him? Have you heard of a French film called �La Collectionoose�? Yes. But my boss reckons you�d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It�d cost you about �100 but he said it�d be worth it. Of course, you�d need a partner to register. But that�s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right? Must be your lucky day then. I�ve got your accounts - you don�t owe much tax for last year. Fine. How was the match? Did you loose? Hello again, neighbour. I didn�t intrude, did I?Jah... �10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy? My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return. Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate. We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention. The �1,000 is on account. When... I�m told he came here... The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about. His address is in this envelope with Leonard�s address, keys and other things you might need. No. And before you ask, no, he�s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious... He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it. Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it. Yesterday. It all looked normal. Then you should not have sought an explanation. I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account. Do what, Mr Lombard? You wouldn�t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now. Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that... What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard! Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard? You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant. Must I speak to you in French? Whatever, you come recommended. We... What if it is? Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it? May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard? Spitz. We spoke on the telephone. My husband... My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is. My son-in-law, Carlos... The gentleman is a business partner of his.We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest. Then why don�t you reach him? A l�achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais �a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C�est pas vraiment mon truc. I don�t know any Austrian, Xavier. Alors quoi? Eh bien... T�es s�r que t�as besoin de moi? La petite m�a l�air assez bien foutue, non? O� est pass� ton salon? Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room... J�ai bien peur qu�il te faudra attendre. Pas avant la matin�e. Cinq cents. Qu�est-ce que tu veux?She�ll be alright. She�s tough... Emily... We�ve still got the Italian... Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. It�s all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what we�ve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make �em sit up and listen. Hi... And losing you, we�d lose him. And that would be a shame, don�t you agree?
