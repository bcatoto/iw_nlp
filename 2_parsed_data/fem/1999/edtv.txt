I don't think so. Yeah? Well I'm not starting now. Ed -- Ed -- Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off -- Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth. Leave her be. Ed, do you want my advice? Great line. Yeah. That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month. We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month! A woman wants to be pursued. Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari? Uh-huh? How you doing, Ed? Good idea. Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes? Yes, Ed. I do. I bet my career on you. You'd better be good. Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you? That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay? I want you to take this. Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you. Ed, can I see you a second. What did you study? I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here. Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go! Good luck. I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us. Take him off the air. I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable. He's who we want to go with.Never would be plenty. It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out. No, I mean...I'm a whore! Your bathrooms are filthy! I'm a tramp Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us! Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore! Ed! How did you know I was here? Don't tell Al. He doesn't know. Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex. One thing led to another. He was my husband once. Oh my god! On TV! To you? In front of him? With the... What? Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him -- It was horrible. He called me up. St. Joseph's. He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart. I'm at the hospital. Eddie... Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia. Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie. And what did he come back now for? He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al. This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone. What's the difference? She had white shoes. She could've been a nurse. He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose. All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay? I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television! He had girlfriends! Both. Yes. I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts. I can't believe you're taking his side. Oh my God!! Oh my God! Mm. I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"... I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy. No. Maybe he's watching. Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl. He made a mistake. Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend. No. It's a mess. No. Send him away. Are the TV people with you? Eddie? ...Yeah. Why? Ed? Good? No. It's going to be about a half-hour. Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay? Are you busy tomorrow night? We have to stop meeting like this. Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown. Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh... I'd better get a cab. I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great. Hi. That girl's an idiot.Welcome to work, Ed. Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late." Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday. I batted! Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry. Um, yeah, I was gonna ...Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had -- What are you doing? Our foibles, our foibles! They're gonna mock our foibles. What does that have to do with... ? How? Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours. Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles. What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?She wouldn't tell me. She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself. She won't. She left. No. Hi, Mom. She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now. Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number. What do we have to do? My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut. You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner. It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship. This is going right up your ass. Everybody's someone. What? The what? No... Could you? No. It's your fault. ...yeah? Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show. Are you all right? Okay. I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone. Where? I'm sorry. So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita. I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City. Ed? There's a list. Twenty-nine. A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no." They hate me! Page three of the Post. Look at this. Everybody hates me! I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month! Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other. ... yeah, then, but... I really like you too... I know, I ... I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away. Um... Why? That's lucky. Oh yeah. The what? You should see the one we wear when it rains. Yeah, well... What are you doing? Oh God, this is so weird. Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you. Really? Go! Leave. Go. I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television! Oh my God. Really? I mean bad. I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him. Ha! Don't defend that horse's ass to me. What do you want?! Right. Dynamite is dangerous. So? Cream rinse? Why do it? Are you sure about this? Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me. Yeah... By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X. What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this? By the X. Sign here, please.I love you! 1 want to marry you! Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph. Who's Shari? Ray, where do you keep the glasses? Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude. Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out. That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
