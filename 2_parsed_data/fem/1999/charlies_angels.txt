And thanks to you, too, Bos. I thought you were dead. I thought the police might be here. Or your neighbors. Or your parents, here to identify your remains. I saw your car was here, so I knew you weren't carjacked and brutally beaten, left to die on the highway. Hello. Absolutely. I'll be right in. But you can understand why I thought so. You missed our date last night. You didn't call or anything. I was just sitting there by myself. I can tolerate a lot, but punctuality and attendance, those rank very high in my list of dating priorities. Bobby? Just once, I want to date a normal man, without a wife, or a drug addiction, or bondage issues. I'm sorry, Bosley. I only made enough for three. Good morning, Angels. I'm sorry to call you back from vacation, but we've got a case that just can't wait. Meet Eric Knox. He's cute. He's 28-years old, and in three days he'll be a billionaire, when his company, Knox Technologies, goes public. Last night, Knox was kidnapped from his own office. Any ransom? No one's heard a thing from the kidnappers. They don't want money. They just want to sink our company. Angels, meet Vivian Wu, vice president of finance for Knox Technologies. She's hired us to find Knox. The initial public offering is in three days. If we don't get Mr. Knox back, or if word gets out that he's missing, the company stands to lose a billion dollars. We need your help. Alex, I want you and Bosley to stake out Roger Corwin. For the past year, he's been trying to buy Knox's company and their new browser software. Knox refused to sell. His company, Red Start Systems, has the most to gain from Knox's disappearance. Exactly, Alex. Let's keep our eyes on Mr. Corwin, Angels. If Knox is still alive, Corwin might lead us to him. Any chance you can join us, Charlie? Can you not drive my car so fast, Dyl? I'm trying to type. Here's Corwin's itinerary. Hold that thought. Uh, hello?   Expensive equipment. Check this out. New program I just got from a friend in the Bureau. We take that footage from the kidnapping... ... isolate the part of the suspect's face that's revealed, then retriangulate his bone structure... ... and voila!     We've got a composite. Keppler-Wilson. Anytime. Anytime, day or night, I am... excited ... to be handing out champagne. I'm working. He's a bartender. I need dependable. I need reliable. I need a Volvo man. Miss!   Miss!   I'd love some champagne. What are you reading? That's the new Michio Kazura. That's not even out in America. Hello?    Warriors of the Broken Earth?   Classic. Tomuru nasgawa ishi Tokyo sen! I'm Natalie. Listen, there's an animation festival at the Egyptian this week. I was wondering if you might want to... I'll meet you there. I'm on it. Vegetarian spring roll? Two guns. One ankle, one shoulder. You take point. I'll circle behind. That way. There are times I wish we carried guns. Hey!    Hands off, assh.... Okay, to summarize? Damn. No, it wasn't. I've seen this before, he's scrambling his calls through a secondary location. We need to tap this phone line at the source, THEN we'll know where his calls were coming from. Bos, can we check a directory? Hey look!   Mechanical bull. Mind if I try? Guten Morgen! If it goes down the mountain, that's all I need. Oh God, no. I have a date with Pete.   Right now. "Gee, sorry Pete. I had to rescue a billionaire." I'll sound like a flake.   I can't stand flakes. You think? Good work, Angels. Not only did you save Knox, you saved his company as well. Say, Fiji? Sorry, Angels.     Our work is only half-done. Meet your new client, Eric Knox. That's where you come in, Angels. We need to break into Red Star's computer systems to see if Mr. Knox's software is indeed being converted for Red Star's use. Sounds like a plan. Not as easy as that, Natalie. Red Star's headquarters are as tightly guarded as a military facility. We're going to need reconnaissance on their mainframe computer system, and the best way to get that is through Mr. Corwin himself. We need to pin a camera on him to get footage of the inside of the building. Thanks to Alex's work at the health spa, we know that Corwin will be at the San Diego Speedway on Thursday. Get close to him Angels, but don't tip your hand. Dylan, I need you to arrange for Mr. Knox's security. I'd hate to have him kidnapped again. I nicked him. Should give you enough time to do the deed. Chuck, time and again we hear the question, "Why don't the police just ram the other car, or shoot out the tires?" The LAPD has a policy of hanging back and following unless... So if we want to find proof that Red Star stole Knox's technology, that's the computer to tap. So you install a transmitter. Patch in directly to the relay, broadcast on a high frequency. That way, you can have access to the mainframe from the comfort of your own home. And they have no idea that you can peek inside. That's all fine in theory. But you still have to get inside that room to install it. What about security? It sounds impossible. Only the two directors can disengage the fail-safe. We have to get their keys. I'll have Systems get to work on this right away. I don't think you understand how important that data is, Mr... But... Uh oh, lemme guess. You're off to chase bikinis at some tropical resort? Have to go.   Plans tonight. Hey Dylan, can we talk to you for a second? There's something going on between you and Knox. Isn't there? Uh, yeah Dylan, it IS.    He's a client. What? She doesn't have ANY point, Alex, I can't believe you're siding with her. You know Charlie would NEVER approve of this. Really. Ladies room.    I'll be back in two minutes. Who do you work for? Speak now or never again. National Security Agency?   You're with the NSA? I'm so sorry, but I have to go. I can't explain. This is my cell phone number. Please call me tomorrow. Please. I'm sorry. Dylan, we were set up. Vivian Wu is not who she says she is. She's a former assassin and an all around bitch. What?! I'm ten minutes away. Wait until I get there. Dylan... I see you take your bodyguarding services seriously. Still, I worry that no one is watching the door. All the same, I'm concerned about Mr. Knox's safety. Please, take a seat. I'm almost finished. Really. How disappointing. Pity. Bad news: The other angels are still alive. Good news: Everything else proceeding apace. Oh, shut up. She can't have survived.   It's too far. Still, I should probably check... Who knew that we are actually tapping into the main servers for The National Security Agency? Wait a minute. We installed the transmitter, yes, but we never gave him the receiver. That laptop was the only way to access the transmitter. And we gave the laptop to... I don't even want to think about what I'm thinking right now. Nice work, Dyl. Bosley's close. BOSLEY! Bosley, can you hear me? How do I get up to you? Hello?... Pete, hi! How are you? No.   Not at all. You know, work this week has been really busy. It's been hard to focus. See, the thing is, I'm not a full- time waitress. I should have been more up-front about that, it's just... Everything's fine! Hate to disagree. Is this the famous Charlie? You bitch!   I like that guy. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a quality man in Los Angeles? To be honest? I don't care. I can handle villainy. I can even handle super-villainy. But what you did is just wrong. Hi, Bos! Don't worry, we'll get him. But Bosley, you HATE sports, why would you... You didn't buy them for yourself. I always saw him as younger. No, silver hair. And tan. He's outside a lot. How hard can it be to spot Charlie? I got the floor. Roger that, Alex, I'll stop the clock! Bosley!   Are you okay? Great work, angels. You'll be happy to know you received another presidential commendation. Enjoy your vacation, angels. Alex, Natalie -- I know you've been putting in some long hours on this case, so I thought you might enjoy a chance to catch up with some old friends.
