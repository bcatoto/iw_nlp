It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it. Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried. I'm late for lab. Remember, that poet that we liked � the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets. No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you. Hey, where's your sweatshirt? Exactly. Yes, it's lame. Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame. I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die? Sometimes I wonder what they talk about. That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group. This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique-- Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge. NASA. Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other. How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year. Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus? Sure. No problem. Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974. Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist. I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table. Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know. : Because he's Guy Perkins. Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat? Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot. Nice. Well, do you? guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now- When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase. Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.Nope. Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help? You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you. Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation. Gus, have you ever been in love? YOU KNIT? Oh, man! Who told? Well excuse me. OH! How about "Under the Sea?" Right. Right. I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox! Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal. Oh look. Class is over already. If you say so. Well. I like a man who gets to the point. It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you. You need my help? Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you? Hi! Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast! And we're going to have to do something about your hair. Cuuuute! I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady. Bridgework? So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one. Now this is cute. Mama mia. Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation. Okay. That's bad. Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes. So, you were a geek. Big deal. Senorita Josie. Jos, that's not what we're -- No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin! Jos - Maybe you should turn it down. Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear. Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion. Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy� If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye. Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?! I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date? You stood for like a month. Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it? And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can? Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure. Who told! Guess who I did it with last night...Well I'm so glad that you guys are. Oh. I forgot. What? Right. 7:30. � uhh, must have forgotten- Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around? It is? Have you ever wanted to go to The Court? Yeah, I know. What's that? Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once. What is with this school and prom? College? Petty good. Thanks. So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be? Hey--I went to Northwestern! Once. To use the bathroom. Oh I know. Yeah. Let's do that. Why do they listen to Guy? How long will they watch us for? Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse." What? Never mind. That is so awful that they hide your cars. Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat. I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name. Wow. It's packed. No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own. Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do. Anita! 'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing. How about this? Very romantic. What'd you feel when you kissed him? That is lingerie. At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool. The girls threw them at me in the locker room. Anita, remember espadrilles? And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles? Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs? Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this. You don't think I can do it. My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller". I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing-- When I finally get kissed, I'll know. The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him. Anita! I'm concentrating on my career right now. Forget it. Yeah. Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex. You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him." Roger in Op/Ed. I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus. Wings? What is this? George! What are you doing here? Rosalind and Orlando. From "As You Like It"? Shakespeare? Betty. Do I want to be crunched? Why? Transitioned? Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft. That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day. Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story. You already pitched this to Rigfort?! There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me. He's my teacher! You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No. What if I say no? Gus? Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural. They hid my car-- Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this. Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session-- Uhh, no. Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go. Kristen got a quote? Oh. Right. Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf-- It's an expose on cafeteria food. It's my dad. He worries. Hi, Dad. I miss you too. But I don't want it straightened out. Hey--I can be out of control. You don't think I can grab bulls' balls? A--flack jacket. They don't have to be in the office Christmas show? You've done five of my ideas. Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good. Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk? Five-- Six-- Well, excuse me for caring about words. It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings. You said that already. Oh. Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold". What about you? What are you thinking about? Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her. You know what? Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo. Yes. I'll go. Yes. Maybe we should go in a different room? Hey. There. Rob's? Oh my god. Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed. Yikes. Bikes! Hey Rob, what's going on? You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives. Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person. Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas. I- wasn't even thinking about- Really? Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought-- Thanks. And what are - Rufus? She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal. Really? Rob-, that girl is sixteen. Hear one. Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day. You're twenty-three years old! Are you crazy?! You can't do this. I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare. Better than I... Yes, desperately. Is that true? Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular? Rob. Please focus. Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South. Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible. I can't do this. Good. Are mom and dad here? Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God. Josie Grossie. It was a long time ago - What!? I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school. I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre. It's just for a couple of months. For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life! How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills? This--this is a luau that sells packing material! I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and-- Better person than I. Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal. Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do. Okaaaay.... That car's going to bankrupt you. That is so--weird that you name your car. I finally found my story. Please. Please don't walk away. I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again. I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person! But now you don't have to-- Wait, I was going to tell you-- You were attracted to me? No, surprise, I thought you'd be-- Yeah, I have. It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you? Well, are you here with anybody? Thanks. So do you. Wow. You believe in me that much-- Oh--yikes! What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college-- Do you think you'll find her? To put us back together again when we fall. That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us-- But Humpty Dumpty was alone. Thanks. They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee? When are you going to open your eyes? You have to say that. You're my teacher. That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to-- Why do you do that? I know. I don't have to say that. You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom. That's what makes you interesting. As a teacher. Don't look down! Of course. I remember everything from your class. Oh right. The Spiderman incident. You're afraid of the Ferris wheel. Are you--scared? Thank you. Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear. Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college. We just go right into sheep herding. College. Haven't really thought about it. Thank you. Oh I don't think so. Well, I'm definitely seventeen and now definitely late-- Sure, why? But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right? I love the way she writes. Dorothy Parker-- Sorry. Forgetful. I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie. The poem! I knew he liked the poem! Billy Prince is asking me to the prom. Why? What?You so do not deserve to be prom queen. Who are you guys? We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group. It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it. Nah uh. That is so sad --That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen? Did I say that out loud? Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie. Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures. wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different. Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax. You ruined the whole thing! Josie, you look Rufus. We're very evolved. Into our group. Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams. I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.That's what I'm saying. I don't know. Billy Prince is asking you to prom. Yes.I'm Rob's prom date. But I'm not a penguin. You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time. God, I can't do this. Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex. Good. Gibby gave me champagne. Are you having fun? No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame. Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up? Duh. Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
