Then don't. Hmm. You know that's really a shitty middle name! Well, that's what your friends call you. I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend. Oz, it's okay, I know. This isn't any better, Chris. This isn't the best way to proposition me. What's that? You're missing the game for us?! What about the game?! ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy. You can't sing at the competition. ...yeah. So we're gonna be close next year? Sure. Yeah. You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know. And they're like, "You'll figure it out." Yeah? When? Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one. Yeah. So wow, you've got it figured out. Oh, yeah. So what're you gonna major in? What? Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern. I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was? So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it. That's nice. Really? Cool. Tell him his subs are great. Well...I needed to find you. We are gonna have to practice that song. Stifler told me. Hi... Yeah? Well you can't fake your way through this. You better practice. Why are you doing this? Give me a break, you're so full of it. I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies. Oh, please. I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with. But you are just a jock. No wait. You're a jerk. No, I like the car. By the way, though, about prom? That was like a bad idea. Sorry I invited you. I'm glad you think so. Yeah, me too, okay, cool. Okay. So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone -- Come on! I won't tell. What's your middle name? Do I have to? Um...Chris -- Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience. You like, "kicked butt." Oh...well that's okay. Cool. Well the same things you do. Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever. What do you think I do? You? You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss." Of course, I didn't -- Okay. I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something? Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there. Not bad, Chris.Sure. Are you kidding? You've never double- clicked your mouse? Well that's a no. No wonder you're not psyched about sex. You've never even had one manually? Of course he does. What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period? Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex. So did you do the physics write-up? What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for? Milk and cookies? Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet. Yeah right. Duh. Of course. Naturally, I embellished a little bit. Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman? Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now. That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera." So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed. So he did, and I did. Are you kidding? No. Thanks. It was my idea. No comment. Well it's up to you. The Big L, or the Big O. Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her. That's how I was duped. Do you love her? Do you? No. No you haven't. You got it, stud. I'll give you a hint. "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!" Comprende? Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you. What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons. You gotta give her what she's never had.Okay! Don't you want me to? Come on. I saw you on the net. Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing! Now, I have two rubbers. Wear them both, it'll desensitize you. I don't want you coming so damn early. What, you think I don't know how to get myself off? Hell, that's what half of band camp is! Sex ed! Oh! And then this one time? At band camp? I stuck a flute in my pussy. Yes! And he was such a dork! And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care? Because it was so funny! Well, this one time? At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it? But it's called spin the bottle? And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips? And... You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual. That is a nasty story! Are they gross or something, like guy stuff? Tell me. It reminds me of this one time -- Hey, can I ask you a question? How come you don't have any stories? I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any. You know, at band camp? We have dances like this. Only they're way funner. Don't you think prom is just highly overrated? Cool! We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp... Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards? That would be so cool. Really? You seriously want to go with me? Michelle. I thought so. Because, one time? I was at this -- Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.I am sorry, Jim. I suppose we will not be doing any studying now. Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me... You are done, James. Perhaps I should be going now. Jim... Can't what? Do you not want to be with me? I wish to be entertained, James. No, no, you must put your whole body into it. Move with the music. For me? Yes, slowly. Well. You have seen me. Now it is my turn to see you. Strip. Shame on you! James! You have come in here on purpose?! Do you mind? This fabric is so uncomfortable. Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards. I can change clothes at your place? Perhaps you can help me with my studies? You are very good in the world history class, yes? Okay. I thought so.I had no idea you'd be this good! Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me? Aged eighteen years. Why don't you get the glasses. Behind the bar. All right, I got some scotch. I believe the kegs are upstairs. Pardon me? I'm so happy for you. Takes the edge off, doesn't it? And where might your date be? As if there were any alternative in the matter. Are you enjoying yourself?Jessica, can you drive me home? ...I've never tried it. I think I've had one. He likes it. Please. Jessica! He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready. It's got to be completely perfect. I want the right place, the right time, the right moment. That's not why we're going out. What? We both have cars. Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M. Your little pact. Jessica told me all about it. Way to go, Kev! I know. Let's go. Don't you have something to tell your friends? No, Kevin -- That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing. That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything. Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it. Yeah, the time went by so fast. Yeah. I love you. I want to hear you say it. Okay. I don't know. How do you? Okay. Did you bring a condom? Yeah. You sure you're comfortable? Yeah, are you? Wow, Kev...it's perfect. No...I know the perfect time... Kevin... I want to have sex with you. And I want to make things perfect for you. You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special. So have I. And I know you want to make things perfect for me. And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it. Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville? Okay. Kevin...you're not your dad. The two of us, we're not your parents. But you don't love me. Kevin? Do you not love me? Yes -- I think you're so right, Kevin. Like how? Yeah, we have. You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five. It's everyone's trick, Kevin. But I did pick it up from you. No, I'm not. I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems. Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April. Oh Kevin -- don't stop! Oh...ungghhhhh! How? I think "shithead" really says it. Not for you. Let me know. Tonight? Oh, Kev. Kevin, this is serious! You think so?
