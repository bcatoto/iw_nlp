Wait. Wait. Listen to me.    Can you feel that? That's my hand. Hold it.    Go on -- as hard as you can. It's over, and I've got you, and you're safe. You're safe now. You got that? Don't let go. Don't let me go. That car is older than they are. That's what I said. Don't we all. Get it together, officer. I just dealt with the situation. The prisoner... He grabbed me.     End of story. If you think I crossed the line, put it in the report. Thanks. But  she'll invite friends, try and fix me up. She's always trying to fix me up so she doesn't have to worry about you and me. They all worry about that. You don't need to fix me, Robby, or fix me up. I don't want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away 'cause he can't stand the cop thing -- or worse: he wants cop stories every night 'cause it turns him on, and he has no idea who I am inside my head. Anyway, I'm busy tonight. Yeah.   Hot and heavy. You know Dan and I   renewed our vows last year. I    bet that's where your mom got   the idea. Their vows? Your mom and dad -- the ceremony... Oh, well... y'know, I just got that invitation a few... just now, so I'm sure you'll... Oh, yeah. We've had... there's been some problems with the mail in our building, so... I'll probably get it today. So, I guess I'll see you. I didn't see his truck, so... How you doing? Kathy and the boy? Bet he's big now. Is he looking more like you now -- or did he get lucky? Place is coming along nice. The octagon window. Dad's signature. Look, Larry, I shouldn't have to hear it from Mrs. Vander -- about what's happening. So you really weren't going to tell me? Nobody was going to tell me? Mom and Dad renewing their vows, the church, the party. Mrs. Vander is all excited. She bought a new dress. It's blue. Mom told him? He's holding out, hah? It's my family. Jesus, Lar. It's over ten years, and he won't let go of it. Nice seeing you, too. Two more minutes. We're bringing Larry his lunch. Hey, it's good to see you. It's been awhile. What? Oh, I went boom into a low shelf -- chasing after him of course. How're you doing? I'm semi-okay. I heard about the... ceremony and the party. Oh. I hope you'll be there. Really. Take it easy.    You too, Champ. Oh, no. You're not breaking my fingers again. Freeze!    Right there! I was dead.   Y'know. He had me.    I was dead. Wednesday. Oh? That's good. Ahh -- they had the broccolini today. Thank you. You didn't tackle her, too, did you? Good, Catch. Are you in trouble? Well... that's a good thing. Where? I like how you're always asking the big questions, Ray. Here -- use this -- call your wife and ask her instead. Robby's a family man. The head.   Do you mind? That reminds me, Ray. You still have that eye-liner you borrowed from me? There you are. We thought you wouldn't show.    Why you sitting here? I didn't have a chance to thank you. I'm Sharon Pogue. You look familiar. Why would you do that -- jump a man with a gun? He could've shot you. You have a death wish? You a bungee jumper? What d'you think about it now? For someone you don't even know? I never thought about it. Now I'm walking around this town because of you. Ever think about that? Maybe you should be a cop. What? Does it work? Bullshit. Not in here.    It's mostly cops. You have a nice smile. So... what were we talking about? Oh, yeah, you were giving me some line about starting a conversation. Okay.    I'll play. Tomorrow I've got a night watch shift. If the weather clears, in the morning I'll go hiking. If it rains, I'll go to the gym -- and the laundromat. Ten years from now... I want to be living in some mountainous place. Could be Tibet. Could be Colorado. Your turn. Actually, I'm kind of tired, Ray. I'm taking off. It's not a great neighborhood. Maybe I should walk you to your car. Want a ride home? It's starting to rain.   Don't be a hero. Okay... ten years from now, what d'you want to be doing? Oh yeah?   What am I doing there? I'm not pissed off at you. Those guys  in the bar are my friends --  sort of. We work together,  we tell jokes and we bullshit,  but I can't say to them... What I want  is to know how you happened to  be walking by that parking lot  at that minute. What if you hadn' t been there? If you want -- you can come in for a minute. Want a drink? Sit down or something. You're not supposed to look around. I didn't have time to straighten up. It's rude. I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm mad. I don't usually let somebody in here, but here you are. That's all. Let's talk about something stupid. Okay -- one thing I don't believe is that 'supposed to' business. We were 'supposed to' meet. That sounds a little fringy to me, like something you might hear on public access TV. You believe that? So, we... smell each other?   Who says that? You mean like   a duck? No. I think dead is   dead. I've been thinking about   it all day -- and I don't want to   think about it anymore. Why'd you do that? Thanks for... coming up here. No.    You don't have to.    I... Oh.    You're here as a medic. Maybe going is a good idea. Why? Oh, God. Shopping day? It's looking great, Mom. Thanks, honey. It's the best year ever for the impatiens. The very best. Let's go in. Looks the same. Still smells like cigarettes. I thought he quit. He's down to six a day. Your hair looks nice. Are you well? I guess I'm well. Is this always here? Yes.   It's always there. Did Larry tell you I came by where he's working? Is that why you called me? I called because we want to invite you to our renewal of vows. It's three weeks from Saturday. Who's 'we.'     You said 'we' want to invite you. The family. How come you're renewing your vows? It's sort of... a fresh start. Your idea? No. Both of us. It's a way of... having the marriage blessed. Wasn't it blessed before? Sherry... of course it was blessed. You just... I just what, Mom? You just think about the bad, and you never remember the good. I wish you remembered the good. Sorry.  I wish I did, too. Does he? Remember any good about me? Of course. He doesn't hate you. He just... still feels hurt. Hurt?    I hurt him? It wasn't as bad -- you always make it sound worse. And it hasn't been that way for years. Mom, I'm your daughter. I don't want any trouble -- ever. I'll come to the ceremony. I won't come to argue, and I won't come in uniform. It's on the 23rd. Saint Monica's. I'd like you to send me an invitation. Mrs. Vander said it's a beautiful invitation. I'll show you. Mom. I'd like to get one... in the mail... from my family. Okay? Yes. Tell Dad... thanks. Damn it! What?!     Who?! Oh, Jesus. I was just falling asleep. Finally. It wasn't a 'date.' I need more sleep. Come back in a month. Then why are you here? What's in the bag? Did you bring some coffee? What else did you bring?   Food? Just black.   Black. Thanks. So what kind of life did you rearrange in order to get to Denny's? You never said one word about yourself last night. What d'you do? What's the difference?! You're standing in my bedroom. That's the difference. Who are you? You're ducking. Don't duck. Oh, shit -- you're married, right? I don't believe you. No. Oh, God. Oh, wait -- you're involved in some criminal activity, aren't you? Great -- That's all I need. That's ridiculous. Why? Oh.   Your rules. Jesus. Okay. Fine. I don't really want to know you anyway. Goodbye. Your life.    I don't want any surprises. That's all of it? Which is? You thought you were what?       Gay? I'm supposed to understand that? I don't know.    I just don't know. Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody. It's been almost two years. Every time I tell somebody, it gets a little bit easier. I'm not saying it goes... She nice? She pretty? She is pretty. It doesn't matter. We like it when men apologize. Have a cookie.     See? Lieutenant... Why?   What'd I do? My attitude's fine. End of a long day. I'm tired. Family?! What about Larry? Larry.     Oh Christ. Thanks for telling me. I wanted to catch you before you went to work. I don't sleep much. Can I come in? I'll just say hello. Don't make it worse. It gets worse? He's okay now. He's torn up about it. Don't make him mad. When Larry and I were growing up, our mother said that all the time. 'Don't make your father mad.' Has he hit Larry Jr. yet? He never would. Oh.   Just you, huh? You see a pattern here, bro? People always say that: 'I've got a temper.' Like it's an excuse. Don't hurt her, Lar...! I know how it feels, 'cause I remember. I remember standing between you and Dad and taking the blows for you -- and for what?! You turned out to be just like him, you bastard. And so did I. Oh, God. Oh, shit. It's you, right? Can you just shut up?    Just shut up and listen. I don't want to talk. I don't care if you have to play some game and pretend you're a... 'angel of mercy' or... whatever. I don't care, but I don't want to hear about it. All right? I don't want to hear anything. It's a bad night. This is good... but I'm too tired to stand up anymore. You want to kiss me? Kiss me someplace I've never been kissed. Why do you stop? You always stop. If you're in trouble with him, maybe I can help. This is not a great place to walk. I work here.   It's not fine. Besides the shootings, break-ins, rapes, cart thefts? We've got a loose dog raiding garbage cans, knocking 'em over. Can't catch him. Got somebody blowing a trumpet between midnight and three. Can't find him. You know everybody here? Try what? I feel like a jerk. I feel like a smiley face. Go on. Move your arm! What are you staring at? It's none of your business! Who the hell are you to talk to me?! Get away from me! What?! I'm calling the police! Jesus Christ, Catch. Blind to what?! Or like me, right? What about you? How come you can see? I'll be out. Let's go talk in the yard. You took a swing at me. I'm sorry I hit you so hard. Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's face?! Don't go to my department, all right? Larry... Because the job's all I got. I got a life! How the hell would you know about my life?! I thought you walked all over the city. My favorite lunch spot is another half mile. I'm okay.   Everything's code four. Everything's fine. Yesterday -- you mean you want to hear about it? No kidding. Why? You never talk about yesterday. Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we rolled on a 415. Juliette and Sanchez had these four guys against a wall, but they were H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It got pretty jumpy, but we got them in the car with a couple of bruises and Robby got a sprained wrist, so I did the rest of the shift with a rookie who lost it over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old woman who'd been dead maybe six, seven days, and I usually do all right but the smell got to me, and I can still smell her. Then we arrested a prostitute working out of her home, and I carried her little girl out to the social worker, and the kid was holding on real tight and making my shoulder wet and I wanted to punch her rock-head mother, and then shift ended and I had a nice visit with my brother Larry. Sorry you asked? Well... I feel better now.    You feel better? What are you doing?! Catch! There's no swimming here! And you can't be naked in a state park! What if a park ranger comes?! Looks like a bad one. We should be thinking about lunch. We have to pack up. Some of us have to work. You ever work? Oh?   You remember that?   Working? I have to check these jacket pockets. What's your name -- Allison? I need to unsnap this, Allison. I'm checking your waistband. You got to Whitney School? St. Mark's. Lift your arms higher. Got a good basketball team at St. Mark's. You play basketball? He says before I came along, he thought he was dead. Sounds better when he says it -- Listen. Shhh.   Sh! The trumpet player. Wow. Look at that moon. Are you McGuire? Mark McGuire? Then put that bat away.   Put it in your trunk. Now. Don't get oil on it. If I go, my brother'll hurt    me with the department. I got     mad and knocked him down. All     they need is a complaint. Just     leave it alone and keep rubbing.     Okay? Can't you rub without talking? It's been bad with my family a long time, so the hell with it anyway. If they don't want me there, I don't want to be there. All right? Oh, Jesus! My father used to knock us around, all of us. But I'm the one who called the cops -- finally. They say I turned against the family. You don't know anything about it. So forget it. Oh, yeah?   What about it? I didn't close the door. You have all the answers. You close with your family? Oh, God. Go away. Catch!   Catch! Are you all right? Your elbow's bleeding. I... What's wrong? Where are you going? Catch -- you're scaring me. Please... Please, Catch, don't... Can't you talk to me?! Please.   Wait.     I... Catch! It's personal. Catch? Give me fifteen. I'm not sure.    Who am I speaking to? What kind of doctor? Do you know a Catch Lambert? I... need to talk to you. Are you a...? And Mr. Lambert... He's your patient. He's your patient we... know all this. This is police business. I'm officer Sharon Pogue -- L.A.P.D. In general. In general.   He's your patient, and he... Why did he walk away? More. What accident? A bus... and a van. Where?        On... the freeway? Survivors?   Only him?      I... don't remember. Yes.   I was there. I was there. Does he... still see her? He says... he doesn't remember the accident. I think he remembers me. How does he live? Catch, it's me. Can you pick up? Why don't we... meet tomorrow? I'll be in Westwood. Can you meet me there? Westwood and Cole. About two o'clock. Okay? That's okay. You don't have to explain. So you're the trumpet player who was waking people up -- on my beat. On your roof? That's why we couldn't find you. Like I held you before.   Like I did -- at the accident. What makes it so... unspeakable, Catch? What makes it like that? Is it because you were driving? I read the reports, and it wasn't your fault. It wasn't. Is it because you survived and they didn't? Catch. Please. Hold on, and we'll go in there together... You can talk to them. You can say goodbye or I love you or whatever... To help you. We're not. We're not fine, Catch. Nothing is fine -- no matter how much you pretend. You pretend that nothing happened. You walk all over the city helping people, but you're dying inside. Then walk in there. Walk in there, and I'll walk in with you. Walk in there and say it's real -- what happened is real. Your family died. So you can have a life! Because it happened! Because it's the truth! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry it happened, but... Catch -- take my hand.    Please. I can't. Because I want it too much. I want everything with you. I want all of you -- not just the part that isn't hiding and running away... Not anymore. It doesn't have to be this way anymore because you're not alone -- because we're the family now. We can be the family... I just... want to say... When you're ready, I'll be there for you. I just want to say that. No, I think I'll turn vegetarian. There's something I have to do.    I need an address and phone. Elanora Chu. Pogo? I'm Sharon Pogue. I know all about the... Elanora. I'm sorry for... what happened.     I know about the accident. He told you?! Oh.   Yes. I guess he comes here a lot -- to talk to you. He shops for me. Twice a week. Oh. And when he comes here -- he never mentions the past, never talks about the accident? No. And you... let him do that?    All this time? Why? It's what he needs. Walking all over the city like... Like an angel.     Yes. Sweet man. But... you let him get so lost. I let him find his own way through it. Why did you come here, Sharon? Because... I want to know how to help him. You are helping him. I don't think so. Why not? He... he was paying me back, I guess, for the accident, for helping him. That's why he felt... so close to me. But... Is that what you think? But now he probably hates me. What happened? I took him to the cemetery, and... The cemetery! I thought it might help him... come back, you know? But he wouldn't even go in. He screamed at me. What made you take him there? For the truth... He knows the truth. But he won't even say it, or... That's his way. That's his way through all this. He made a wall -- around that whole day, that night -- other things, too. He keeps them behind the wall -- his little boy, my daughter. He can't help it. The cemetery?! Do you know how hard it is for me to go to the cemetery? Can you imagine? That's where it stares you in the face -- the loss. And it's too much sometimes. See? I'm still finding my way through it. And Catch -- it almost kills him to think about it or say it or drive a car or see the place where it happened or... go by the cemetery. I was trying to help him... come back to some kind of life. I... But he was coming back. Do you realize how much he changed in the past weeks? His apartment, his life, his music is coming back. He fell in love! He even got a job, Sharon -- for you. For the two of you. Isn't that coming back? Why do you have to rush? Everybody has to rush these days. I was scared. I push so hard... when I'm scared. Scared of what? Losing him. So I did. I lost him. He won't talk to me. I... I didn't know what I was doing. You were finding your way.    What else can we do? You think    I'm always sure what to say to   him, what not to say? I do what    I think is right and hope he   sees the love in it. Look at you -- so worried now, so miserable. That's the love in it. Did I... make it worse for him? I don't know. I really don't. But I think he'll see the love in what you did. I just came by to... wish you well. To... congratulate you and wish you well. Shit. She came. Don't say anything.   Think of your parents. Where do you want me? I'm the daughter. You both look so great. You, too. I just wanted to... Sure. Sherry!    Look how nice you look. Not so big. Nice dress. Larry... I have to be here. It's a chance to make things right, and I'm taking it. Don't make him talk about... anything today. Mom, I was going to fix his tie. His tie is crooked. It was a nice ceremony. Yes. We're running out of chicken, though. Nobody's eating the ham. It's a great party, Mom.   You look happy. Thirty-five years and still in love, huh? You think that's wrong, don't you? Of course not... I always... I feel like apologizing to you. But I love him. And then I feel like apologizing to him for loving you. I'm the one in the middle. I'm the only one in this family who knows how to forgive anybody. Tons of makeup. On Larry, too. Sorry about that, but... I couldn't stand him doing that to you. I took it on... Don't worry. I'm not your mother. If he tries it again, I'm gone. I'm out of there, me and Larry Junior. He knows that. What're you doing? Don't walk away. Okay? Is it working?     Do you need to check it? Dad... Sharon, please. Please? Please what?! Will you stop protecting him? You were always protecting him! Don't talk to your father. Don't bother your father! I'm going to bother you for one minute, Dad. Okay? Can you handle that? Dad... I'm asking. Am I welcome here? I want to know! Do you want me here? Do you love me, Dad? I want to know. Do you... need to... check that again? What, Dad?   You feel like what? Well... you do. It's a shame you're going to miss knowing her. You're going to miss all that. I'm next. Hi, Mom and Dad. Congratulations. Y'know... being in this house reminds me of something.  I was about ten, I guess, and Larry and I were playing aliens -- remember, Lar? We're making a lot  of noise, and Dad comes home from work tired and pissed off... We're yelling like mad, and Dad bursts into the room and says, what the hell are you doing? And I'm scared. I'm really scared. And I say, we're playing alien invasion, Dad, and he says, oh, yeah, I'll show you a damn invasion, and he picks me up, picks me up off the floor and throws me on the couch. I hit that couch and bounce off, and he grabs Larry and throws him on the couch, and then... then he starts making these monster sounds, and he says, we came to earth to kick ass, and I run at him and jump on him and he tosses me on the couch and then Larry, and we're laughing so hard I almost wet myself, and he keeps tossing us and growling and beeping, and it was... it was great. It was great, and I'm never going to forget that. Never. And I miss that. I miss it. So I just... I wanted to tell you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks. That's all. Bye. Me, too. They don't like me in there. That's a nice thing to say. It's not fair. It's not fair. Things got better for them because of what I did. Things got better, and I'd still do it. I'd do it all over again. And it's not fair they shut me out. It's not. It's not fair. I was     19, and I didn't know what else    to do. I didn't know how else    to stop it. It's not fair I don't    have a family anymore.
