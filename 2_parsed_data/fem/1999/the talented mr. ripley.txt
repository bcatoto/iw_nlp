Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose -- It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys. If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together. Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open. Oh, it was. Bastard! Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks. Oh darling -- is that for me? It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee. I don't like you. No, I like him. Okay, darling. It's vile. I'll come down. Hi Tom. I don't get it. What? What? I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini. Shut up! Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed. Yes, Tom Ripley's here. Well, we ate everything without you. You just woke up! Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock. And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink. You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie? How do you do. I don't know, I don't know, I just know it. Such as? I just don't believe that! Where's Mr MacCarron? I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you. Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day? What are you going to do now, Tom? I don't believe a single word you've said. I don't believe you. Why? When? Why do you have Dickie's rings? I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra. He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day -- I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring. You've got Dickie's rings. I found Dickie's rings. Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent. Tom? Poor man. We were knocking on that door for ever. I think I've broken my strap. Did Dickie's Dad go? Very. To the manner born. He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared. Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him. Tom. Hello Peter, so good to see you. Perhaps I shouldn't go either. Where does Dickie live? What? Dickie? I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. What happened to your face? Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie? Did he kill Freddie? He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home. I'm going to go home. Dickie was at the Opera last night. You were going to Venice. Is he really not here? Is he here? Are you with Dickie? Oh my God. Tom. He hates being confronted. How long's he staying for? Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited... Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone? What does that mean? Ha. Did he say why? Where's Dickie? Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks. Tom, you startled me! You're back. I'll go. Dickie! Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out -- Freddie says there aren't enough rooms. Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way. He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times... The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold. Are you okay? You really should go in, it's marvelous. Frances? Tom, I love you! See! I bought it for him, for his birthday. Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life. Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man. I never said that! Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans? What's going on? How would you know that? I told you! I knew it! Dickie? Do you know Dickie? No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi. And now look at you. A hotel would've been fine. We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched. This is spectacular. Golly. Who's paying for this? Is this you? He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him. So you found Peter... I hope so. Do you know Tom? I don't know her. He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people. No glasses.He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it? Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you. You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie. Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him. So -- are you travelling under R? You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible. You're kidding. When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding? And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much. Hardly. I couldn't be less alone. What? I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you... Dickie, my God! I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps? Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight... Beating you away. No, I absolutely understand. Of course. Don't worry. Really. Don't worry. Okay then, you're crazy. You're crazy! It's freezing out there. I thought you were enjoying yourself? Show me the other one again. I like them both. I've never admitted that to anyone. The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it. Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -- Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R. Everybody knows Freddie Miles. At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and -- But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you? Right. As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too. The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue. Which is? So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there. You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's? Hello. I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall. No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating. What's your secret?
