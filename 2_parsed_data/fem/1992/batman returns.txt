Don't be naive. The law doesn't apply to people like him! Or us -- Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful. You're the second man who killed me this week. But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left. But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it. Hey stud: I thought we had something together. I can't sleep either, lately. A little link, between us. But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it. That could put a strain on our relationship. Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em? Good joke. Wanna hear another one? As I was saying: I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted. Are you listening, you Batman you? How could you? I'm a woman... Where's the fire? You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me. Three lives down. Got enough bullets to finish me off? He is Batman, you moron. Sorry, Max. A die for a die. A half-pint. I'm talking gallons. Your blood, Max. Me, domesticated? By you? I doubt it! You repulsive... awful... penguin . Did I? Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men -- Corn dog! I wouldn't touch you to scratch you. I want in. The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty. Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ... He napalmed my arm. He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation. You're off the hook, Ozzie. But Batman is decidedly not . You're quick. Mayor Cobblepot. He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most. Meaning, us. I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat. Batman. The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment. Down, Oswald. We have to talk. You see we've got something in common.My lips are sealed. Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command. Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal... All is shrill, all is blight... ... eight, seven... Ten, nine...... What do we do? A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ... I don't know anymore, Bruce ... Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will. Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top? When he should be six feet under? You first. Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ... There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding. What say we ... 'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat. Nor I, on the second. It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least they're commited. Well? Was "Vicki" right? About your difficulty with duality? Sure. "Vicki." Ice-skater, or stewardess? And the truth frightened her? What went wrong? Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her. Executive Assistant. Secretary. Girlfriend? I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale? Yes and no... "We"? You and... Yeah? Me too... No darker than yours, Bruce. I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too. -- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight. You're not coming to that, are you? "The Relighting of the Tree" thing? I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds." How do these hacks sleep at night? The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least. Treat to be here. Scare me? No, actually, I was just scaring myself ... Oh. "Kyle." Pouring myself into my work. I'm listed. Well that's a ... long story ... You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck. Yes and no ... You mean mistook me ? Have we? Actually I have to split. Take a "personal day." You don't mind? Max, you're tops. Morning, Max. Bummer about the store. You insured? That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one. Okay, go ahead. Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big. I mean, it's not like you can just kill me. It's our secret. Honest. How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless? Too good? I'm no cat. I'm just an assistant. A secretary -- Big giant capacitor . And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be -- -- sucking power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of? Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say. Well I figured that your password was "Finster." Your Pomeranian. And it was. And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant... No, I am. Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning. I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
