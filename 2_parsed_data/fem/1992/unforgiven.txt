You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole. On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend. Like whores? For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...? You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em? But what they done, they... A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?

You ain't dead.N-no, sir? He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73. Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was... A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T... L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then... About where you an' him was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'... In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..." They got... a sign on him says he was a killer. N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died. Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow. Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill... They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because... He's... he's dead. Ned's share?

English Bob killed him while...? And? But he was called... You were there? I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which... Duke. Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and... Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place. Uh... Duke. D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death. It's only a b-b-b-book... N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite... Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...? Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first. Wh-wh-who did you kill first? B-b-books. You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
