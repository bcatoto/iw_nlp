If Uncas is with you, that means he has not  found a woman and started a family yet. That's what he's doin' to his mama ... Heyward! Duncan Heyward. I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so  long apart and after you've traveled so far ... You still have an aversion to the water? Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest  friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect  you immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings  don't go beyond that. Do you see? Some say that's the way of it. Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ... Yes. Yes, I will. Duncan! We leave in the morning?! I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman  Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded,  red men in the wild! My God, Alice. Nonsense. Papa wouldn't have sent for us  if it were dangerous. Alice, did you see that ...? Alice? Can we rest soon? No, Duncan! Stop it! We need them to get out of here! Though they are strangers, they are at  least entitled to a Christian burial! I will not. I have seen the face of war  before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as  cruel is your indifference. Why didn't you bury those people? You knew them. You were acting for our benefit. And I  apologize. I misunderstood you. Your "father"? He did? What?! Why did they turn back? "We're a breed apart and we make no  sense" ...? Thank you so much. You called Chingachgook your "father"? Where is your real family? I'm sorry. How did you learn English? And what were the consequentialities of  European culture you didn't bother with? In London those radical ideas could land  you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this  defenseless place ...? You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not  understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be,  thinking of it in Boston and London ... On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ...  to my blood ... ... than any imagining could possibly have  been ... Much further? Will we be able to bathe? Thunder ... Papa will arrange something. Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora  doesn't marry you, I shall. Alice! I can't wait to see Papa ... And you, Duncan? What are you looking  forward to? I think it's very important and exciting. Lightning? Papa, Papa!! When? How? There was none! There was no letter. He delivered no such message. Fine, Mr. Phelps. Have you cat gut and a  suturing needle?  And we could use some rum, clothes, and  a place to wash ... Mr Poe? What are you looking at, Mr. Poe? Alice ... Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ...  I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.  I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ... Her nerves are shattered. She's trying  to be brave. Duncan ...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You  have complimented me with your persistence  and patience ... But the decision I've come  to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes  than surrender my own judgment. And it's been unfair to you, while I search  myself for feelings, which, if they were there and as strong as they ought to be,  would've made themselves known long ago ... Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan.  And please take this as my final answer.  It must be no. I am sorry, Duncan ... He saved us! We are alive only because  of him ... He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ... Duncan, do something. You know he wouldn't send me ...! You  misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ... They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ... They hack it out of the wilderness with  their own two hands, burying their dead and  their children along the way. Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable  qualities. But taken as a whole, I was wrong  to have thought so highly of you. "Justice"? If that's "justice" ..., then the  sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for  these people. Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of  sedition, too! They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance? What would you have me do? No. I will find you. The whole world's on fire, isn't it? What is it? No! Stop it!! Are we safe? Our father? Did you see my father? Tell me! Say nothing to Alice ...! Uncas ... Yes. Go ahead. Yes. I want you to go. You try. With all you have. To save  yourself. If the worst happens, and  only one of us survives, something of  the other does, too ...  ... never doubt what you are doing. Nathaniel! What are they doing to Duncan?  Duncan! Alice? I have nothing to go back for. Yes. Where will we go?
