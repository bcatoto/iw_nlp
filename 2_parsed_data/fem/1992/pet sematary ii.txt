I hope he doesn't have rabies. You sure did... What happened to you? Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things... It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young. He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years. I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews... Is something wrong?I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again. You know everything, don't you? I miss him too... How did it go with your father last night? How long have you been here? Geoff? Anybody see my boy?Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead. You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town. The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church". Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat? Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
