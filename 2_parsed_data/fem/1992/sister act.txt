What about crack? You a user? Yeah. We all got caught. Shoplifting. Cuttin' school. Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade. So we gotta come here. So we'll be good, in the future. So we'll learn valuable lessons. And I learned mine. I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again. Can I go now? Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it. You know she thinks it's a sin.Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there? What you do? No, but... I don't know... sometimes. Well, what about the sex stuff? What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow. Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it. Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay. 'Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation. How come? Sister? We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.JUST SING! You re okay -- for a civilian. Van Cartier. We could cut a demo. Look for a label. Is there any syrup? She's a pro. Again! Amateurs 2 Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn! Tell me about it. Wet behind the ears. Of course. I'm a nun. Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer. I knew that. Very nice. Sisters, have we learned our lesson? I won't hold this little episode against anyone. I'll try not to. You're a ringer. She brought you in to replace me. Out with the old. Free-lance? Oh really? You think I don't see? You think I took vows yesterday? I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother. Mary Clarence, are you with us? Soprano or alto? Shirelles. I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods. It wasn't all modern, like here. No electricity. Cold water. Bare feet. Those were nuns. It was Hell on earth, but I loved it. This place is a Hilton. Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place. Enough jabber. We can't leave it up to the Feds! That should have tipped us. We're losing it. Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30. Sharp. Is it worth it? A lot of witnesses here.SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE! BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE Hurry, Sister! This is so exhilarating! All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing. What is it, Mary? We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work. SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE All right, I am, I know it! All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic. Perky. I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine. She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess." Am I? The Dixie Cups? Oh my. I was just a girl. Of course. SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I know. It's ancient. Two days. An hour or so. Chops? Mary Clarence, could you? Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but... Could you help us? Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell. Shuttle, beat, shed. And watch your heddles. You betcha. Isn't it lovely? Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed. Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed. Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear? Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely self-supporting. Like all convents. Like yours. To sell, of course. I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's. We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money. Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent. The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver. Have you ever used a loom? 1961? '62? Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows. It's the last secular music we recall. I haven't heard that song in ages. The Ronettes? Isn't it a glorious morning? Good morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well? We've got to save her! Look what she did with the choir. She made us sing beautifully. We sound terrible We need Mary Clarence. It should be here any minute. Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy? Measles. Peace on Earth. She told us about one. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas. But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun? Bless her! There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve. That's why many of us became nuns. It's marvelous, Reverend Mother. Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother - Yes? Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's. Impossible. Christy. Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun? But how do we get there? It's so beautiful... She's our inspiration! She wasn't a nun? You mean -- they kidnapped her? We'll pray -- and she'll be there. Mary Clarence! Sister! Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us. Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this? But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style. It's better than ice cream. He's kind. He's not like other guys. We did it! We actually sang a chord! Really, Mary Clarence? Were you a choirmistress? Which convent was that, Sister?Really. Oh-huh. Hail, Mary.HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY! BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING I WAS DOWNHEARTED Mary Clarence! But what do they want? Where are we going? Again? Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you? The Council of Cardinals! I'm so nervous! What if I forget the words? Are you leaving us? A thank-you? For what? You're the one we should be thanking. We're nuns! HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU I don't want to mess anyone up... What? Now stop that. You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience. I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood. We could have been killed! But you saved me! Thank you, Mary Clarence! What was all that? Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us? Oh my Lord! Mary Clarence! Mary Clarence! I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences. I've learned so much. Mary Clarence! You're so... different from the other sisters. Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson. Those people are wonderful! Why don't we ever see them in church? I'm getting experience. Who are all these people? Really? I have to do this. So I can become a nun. Experience! Right? We need experience. Mary Clarence! Are you sure? Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it? What? She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner. Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy. I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me! No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out! I want to get in? You have to help me A novice. Three years. Sister. Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert. An extra heel of bread. Please take it, you need your strength. You've been working so hard. I... I brought you something. I... I... It's after five. We have to bathe. Come on, we're late. Not a note. Mary Clarence -- you're alive! A Benedictine. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight! And what a lovely name. Las Vegas... Well, I don't care who she is. We can't sing without her! An... entertainer? Yes -- two men -- and they had guns. We can't sing without her! What should we do? It's no use. She just isn't here. Mary Clarence, don't be silly. You're an example to us all. You've taught us so much. We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows? Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes. Ice cream! It's brought people back to the church. It's better than springtime. I'd rather sing than do anything! He's decent. That was exciting! Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said. Is this like your old convent? Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet? For final vows? Reverend Mother? Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere. She said they were from her old convent. I don't understand. Where is she?Really? Perhaps. Well... thank you. Oh? Don't push it. Perhaps not. Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex. You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion. Very well. I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For utterly disrupting our way of life. And for placing all of us in mortal danger. Thank-you. I'm a Christian. Oh? Saving you. Move! Good day. I am sorry, Mary Clarence. I seem to have misplaced my tambourine. Good day, Mary Clarence. You and I know that life is not so simple. There will be disappointments. Rude shocks. And you will have vanished. How... fortunate. A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party. Indeed. After how long? A few weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know nothing. I must go where I can be of use. I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible. Really. Well, that makes two of us. You have a phone call. The majority has spoken. Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program? I believe this can be settled by a simple vote. The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church. They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place. And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best. And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir. Out of the question. Through blasphemy? You have corrupted the entire choir! And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino. The choir, Mary Clarence. Go for the gold. You're my Olympic event. You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart. As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage. You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir. You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task. Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct. Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself. Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity. To change. To make a decent life for yourself. Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable! I don't believe we have anything to say to each other. Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined! Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on. How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence. "No pain, no gain." Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27? He spoke unto a wastrel youth. He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment." You are correct. Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. Such as your own, for example. How do you feel about physical labor? We are nuns. We seek solutions through prayer. This is a convent, not a clinic. We offer moral guidance, not hardware. A balloon and a banana! Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking? Mary Clarence! Come, Sister. Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return. Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage. Do not attempt discussion. Am I understood? From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. I'm sure. If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life. And its direction. Or lack thereof. It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams. Your cell is more than adequate. And whom would you call? Useless distractions. Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions. Your cell. Your room. This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence. Yes. Until breakfast. No food. Not until sundown. A fast. To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat. As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast. Until sundown. Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard. Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence. And the vow of chastity. The vow of obedience. The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola. There are three vows that every nun must accept. The vow of poverty... As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence. Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all. While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are. You will not disrupt the convent. You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way. Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire. Would you like that? Before we do, you might like to freshen up. And you'll certainly want to change Of course. But it's almost lunch. Check your driver's license. Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines. And all those like you. I joined this convent some thirty years ago. At that time, the world knew some measure of peace. And hope. Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise. And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed. Drugs. Gangs. Spandex. And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls. It has come to pass. Your cigarette -- out. Miss Van Cartier. Sit down. I see. The reason? You were unhappy? St. Anne's? Very well. Enough joking. Your name? What is your full name? Your Christian name? However, we can also pray for other things. All right. It's a beginning. Las Vegas, Nevada. She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger. Really... Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing? I need to see you, at once. Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence? Sister Mary Patrick? Yes, Mary Patrick? Yes? But where? But... she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent. Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were? Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together. But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood. I lied. But, Bishop... We're a small convent, Bishop. Surely there are... more appropriate shelters. But she's been exposed to the underside of life. She is the underside of life. Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but no.And you'll face that danger head-on. As if I could stop you. And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing. I know. St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality. To all in need. Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother. The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation. And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation. We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
