No. Not on station time. My story. My time. I know what I saw. Yeah? Well, you just struck out. It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way. Not tight skirts. Tight stories. Jesus Christ ... What do you mean? Doc? ... Doc ... Hello? Hello? That is the story of my life. You'd lose the money-shots. No. I'll catch a bus. Or a cab. Don't worry about it. Go. Better hurry, Doc. A real story. With a real reporter. I know. I know. But it's just so ... neat, isn't it? The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me. Wha .... ? So where is it? Then tell me what to do. I don't know ... What can we do? What will he do? What does he want? Kirsty Cotton. Yes. But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back? And why are you back? Why are we here? And what did you discover? And what is ... this frozen moment? Captain Spenser. Elliott. I ... What the Hell is going on? It's ... I don't know. First World War, right? Wait ... wait. You ... you have to help me. I don't understand. Am I dreaming this? Help me pick 'em up, Terri. I think the lady just made a sale. God knows. Anything. Contacts. Clues. Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ... Oh, Terri ... Terri? What on earth were you doing down here? Jesus. Are you sure this is the street? It's Saturday morning. Let's go shopping. Would you know this store again? That you found. What do you mean you found it? Woah. Wait a minute. Who? The kid? Maybe not. But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue? No. He knows it won't. It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet. Every day. I don't know his name ... I saw the whole story. A wounded bird was on his roof. I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it. I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't. Its pain spoke directly to him. He picked it up. Nursed it. Fed it. And it got better. Everyday he'd watch the pigeon. Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away. Didn't look back. But he heard the sound of its wings. ... but it is good. You know, over to the left, you can ... I don't think so. But it's a fascinating subject. Did you ... No. I buy them to impress people. Of course I've read them. How have you ... ? The bank owns it. But I'm working on it. No! No, that's OK. I like to. I love boiling water. It's a specialty of mine. Why don't you go watch cartoons? I'll boil some water. Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri. Can I ask? Is it always this ... exploratory? Wait. Wait. The chains. Where did the chains come from? Wait a minute. He was already ... wounded ... when you found him? Taken what? Did you know him? Yes I do. Terri, something awful happened to that boy. I have to find out what it was. Sorry. It was my father's. It's temperamental. I'm trying to quit. I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream? No, you know, you do. You must. What you mean is you don't remember them. What? God, no! Nothing like that. No, he died before I was born. He died in Vietnam. I never knew him. Never met him. We don't even know the details. I dream of battlefields. Of searching. Of trying to find out. No. No, it's OK. I ... It's my father. Why are you so interested? ... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything. It's ... well, I know what it is. Oh yeah ... What? I put some decaf on. Er ... make yourself comfortable. No. No. It's fine. Come now. I was having bad dreams anyway. Yeah. Sure. You mean ... tonight? I want to talk to you. We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night. Right. Right! Joey. Yeah, who is this? Uh-huh? Under the Underground? What's that? Where is ... Where? Hold on. Hold on, please. I need talk to you. What happened to him? I don't know. Maybe. Can we see? What else came with it? Anything still here? Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it? No. We want ... No. No, you don't understand. We're not selling it. It came from here. We want ...Right at the back there. Middle shelves. Coupla folders. Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price. You gonna buy? Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff nobody'd ever want. It was part of a job-lot. Some loony- bin they shut down. Unclaimed stuff. Never mind. I'm glad it's gone. Made the store feel strange. Who'd make such a thing? I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business. I ... Everything sold as is. No guarantees. No returns. No. Sorry. Not interested. Not for my customers. Have you tried ...You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard! You get me in here ... You shit. Who do you think you are? But you gave me a rose ... Oh. Like I'm not an interesting person. Do you mind me talking about your stuff? Wow. Thank you. No. Really? Oh come on. There're lots of girls here who look better than ... I'm sorry. The barman? I thought he was called Rick? A prize? For what? Thank you for the drink. And the rose. Wow. That's ... really nice. And this is your club. Great club. I really love it here. Great club. You're JP Monroe, right?Joey ... ? What am I looking for? Here! Here! Pull over! For somebody else, alright? Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore. Buying some drugs, alright? Yeah. Happening, isn't it? Sure. Why? I was downtown looking for a ... a friend. A guy I know. Anyway, there was this store. Like real old? Lotsa weird shit in there. I saw this statue. Pillar. Thing. I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club. No. JP. My last boyfriend? He like owns the club. You know? You were there? He bought the statue. Yeah. I found it. I knew held like it and I figured ... But I don't know what's going on. Maybe he thinks it'll come back. And he still sits there? Who's that? Cool. I read a book once. It was like all these people discovering who they used to be. You know, like reincarnation? It was really good. You ever read that? Wow. Lotta books. You read all these? Guys. Sometimes friends. Mostly guys. Jeez, I've never owned anything. I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old. This is great. And it's yours? You like own it? I'll do it! Ha! I don't know yet. First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me. I figured I'd make breakfast. That's what I'm trying to tell you! ... Yeah! That's what I'm saying! And it was lying next to him. And he pointed at it before he passed out and ... The thing! He was lying there in the street, moaning. But he pointed at it ... 22 No. I'd seen him in there a few times before. He was just a punk. I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief. He must've taken it from the statue. But I don't know anything! Really. I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street. He ... Oh. You wanna talk about that stuff. It's okay. It's just someone burned me once. Oh, go on. Have one. Fuck it. You think you're going to live forever? Great. Thanks. You gonna have one? No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything. It's just I don't dream. Never have. ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams. I'm jealous. It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean? That's great. Oh, right. Did he used to ... ? Sorry. What is it? Your dream. You said you were having a bad dream. Right. Of course tonight. Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ... Oh yeah. Yeah. Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right? I'll trade you. You give me couch-space. I'll give you talk. OK? Right ... So ... Well, what do you want? You like ... left me a card? At the club? Uh ... Hi! Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill? Under The Underground. Can I like GO now?! Look, lady! I told you! It's not my problem! I was just there! It's nothing to do with me. I wasn't even with him. It was off the statue. In the club. Really? No. It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know? Freaked her out. Just fucked up something good again. I don't think so. Not yet. I'm not ready yet. Yeah right. Look ... A girl? Anyone I should know? Yeah ... yeah, it looks different. Not quite. This wasn't here. Oh, I don't ... Yes. 53 I miss you too. Well ... of course I have. I've thought. I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible. You really hurt me ... You're apologizing? Yeah really. I'm ... Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here. Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station. I'm meeting lotsa new people. It's really great. Yeah right. How'd you get this number? What do you want? JP? Joey?
