What? I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here. Where is he? What are you doing here? She's evil. She's brilliant. Be careful, Nick. I got married. He was on staff at the clinic. I was down in Salinas. It didn't... last long. She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is. You're a good cop -- what did she do? Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant? Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it. She's really sick you know. Don't you know what she's doing? She knows I went to Berkeley. She knows I knew Noah. She makes up that story about me. She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her. I had him in two classes. I did dye my hair. It didn't have anything to do with her. I was a redhead for a while, too. I slept with her once in school. I was just a kid. I was experimenting. It was just that one time. She developed a... fixation... on me. She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did. It scared me. She told you, didn't she? What do you want, Nick? I know the type. I'm a psychologist. My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates -- Yes you do. Something's on with you. You're sleeping with her, aren't you? What is your problem? I'm trying to help you. Why won't you let me help you? Yes you did. I'm a big girl. I can handle it. I hardly knew her. She gave me the creeps, though. I don't know why. She must really be something. From a clinical point of view. How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports? It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports. Yes. I care about you. I did it for you. Sometimes I really hate you. Nilsen. No, Nick, please -- It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall. She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall. What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you? I thought you quit. We were in some of the same classes. Catherine Tramell. What was she like? Baby-sitting. Rookie cop. You don't look so okay. You okay? Yes. How's not smoking? No? How about the coke? How about the booze? How is your -- personal life? So -- how are things? I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay? As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose. Sit down, Nick. How are you, Nick?I hate rugrats. What do we do now, Nick? The games are over. You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter. What do you want, Nick? Flowers? I'll send you some flowers. I told you. She kills him. I finished my book. Somebody always does. Somebody has to die. It won't sell. What happens to them? Really. What are you writing about. What are you researching? I'm very good at research. I'll help you. Come over here and tell me no. Did you miss me? I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you. Liar. You still think I kill people, don't you? You're not going to tell me what she's doing. I thought we weren't playing games anymore. Did you? What's she doing? I just thought I'd surprise you. What's the matter? Of course I knew. Honey, why don't you go in the car? I'll be right there. Funny. What did he say? I'll convince you. Do you believe me? Maybe I'm losing interest in my book. I would've paid more. I wanted to know everything about you. Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better. I'd read about your shootings in the papers. I decided to write a book about a detective. I wanted to know my character. About three months before I met you. I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file. You won't believe me. No more games, Nick. I'm tired of playing games! No. I never have before. No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited. I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college. I slept with her once. She started following me around, taking my picture. She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman. It was awful. For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me. Make love to me. Everybody that I care about dies. Do you think I told her to kill You? I should have known. I came into the house when you were down on the beach. She looked at me so strangely. She left right after you. I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time. She tried to kill you, didn't she? You're in over your head. You shouldn't play this game. I told you I had a vivid imagination. Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets? I don't do those. Fine. How's your back? Do you want her to join us sometime? I thought it was a pretty good beginning. Did you think it was so special? She's seen everything before. I'm leaving the house around midnight. In case you're going to follow me. I'm going down to Johnny's club. I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character. Why take the risk? Good. I'd miss you. You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore. You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you? No. I wrote it years afterwards. You mean did I write it before my parents died? To see if he can get away with it. A boy kills his parents. They have a plane. He makes it look like an accident. Aren't you going to thank me? Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?" It's not the same thing, is it? Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately. You don't have any coke, do you? I love coke and Jack Daniel's. Cheers. My friends call me Catherine. I know, Nicky, but I like it. What if I call you Nicky? Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter? Please. Fine. Not me. Why not? You're not easy to figure. I'm just very good at figuring. Do you? I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me. I have attorneys. They have friends. I have friends. Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends. Yes, you did. They never tested you, did they? But Internal Affairs knew. What happened, Nick? Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much? Only in theory. You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter? Not in theory -- in practice. Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse. Noah was my counselor in my freshman year. That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick. For my book. Funny how the subconscious works. Hazel is my friend. There's a name from the past. Four shootings in five years. All accidents. I don't know. But you do. I'd like to ask you some, too. Would you like a drink? I was just going to have one. No. Come in. You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick? You know all about me. You see? We're both innocent, Nick. Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. For my writing. If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring. It wouldn't be tiring at all. I'm tired. Thanks. You still get the pleasure. Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick? That's right. No. I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game. I loved him. I hurt. I've got a degree in psych. It goes with the turf. Games are fun. Yes it does, doesn't it? No. I said I liked Johnny to use his hands. I don't give any rules, Nick. I go with the flow. I have nothing to hide. Did I miss something? A detective. He falls for the wrong woman. It won't last. I found some in my purse; would you like one? Yes, you do. Do you have a cigarette? Only when they make interesting reading. Are you arresting me? No. I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night. No. We had a drink at the club. We left together. I came here. He went home. Yes. Yes. About a year and a half. I wasn't dating him. I was fucking him. I know who you are. I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer. I'm not stupid. No. Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan. I had sex with him for about a year and a half. I liked having sex with him. What are you going to do? Charge me with smoking? No thank you. I'm a writer, I use people for what I write. You write what you know. Let the world beware. In the beginning. Then I got to like what he did for me. Cocaine. Sometimes. The answer is no. I didn't kill him. You make it up, but it has to be believable. They call it suspension of disbelief. It teaches you to lie. Yes I am. Why would I need an attorney? Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown. I don't really feel like talking anymore. Really. Maybe that's why you're from Homicide. How? How did he die?She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse. The razor just happened to be there. You're looking for Catherine, not me. Is he dead? What do you want? He died -- about five or six years ago. Only if you're making it. No Lisa Anderson, detective. Yes I did. Anderson. Jack W. Donald M. I'm sorry. No Lisa. Fourteen. We seal juvenile records until they're deceased. That's why you didn't find it in your computer. I'm Roxy. I'm her -- friend. You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you? Are you vice?
