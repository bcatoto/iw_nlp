Guess the picnic got rained out. Oh, scary. What are you, like, the night watchman? Talent. Hi. You buying? No onions though, okay? They make you fart. I went to see a friend of mine. She's still dead. He touched me and it stopped.  The pain. I saw a ghost... Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my, sides. Mom --? I told you you're not supposed to come in here. I lost my key. Out.  Now.  I gotta work. You're outta your fuckin' mind. I hate this goddamn thing... Three hundred and your a  gunslinger. Ratty -- shut the fuck up. Who the hell is that? Come on out man, I won't hurt you. Little early from trick-or-treat, homie. This dick trying to bushwack me. Guess you got that goddamn right. Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah... Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think. Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man. I don't know you... Holy shit... you're dead, man... Your scary quotient needs work. I think red's my color, don't you? I don't know how to describe how I feel, Lance -- so restless -- You're my Moon Queen, Angelique. Oooh -- I want you're rocket right now in my Sea of Tranquility --  Lance -- What are you supposed to be?  A clown? You look like a rock star without a job. If you're not some kinda child  molester. Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight. Speak up. Clear it with the Captain if you need a file. Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file? My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now. Mister Funboy. He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much. Can you play that thing or do you just carry it around everywhere? Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?" It used to be her favorite. No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions. Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...? Do you feel okay. You gotta go now, I bet. Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit. Your last little wild goose chase got you busted back to the Beat  Patrol, just like in a bad detective story, Eddie. Are we doing the wildgoose thing again? You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's  chocolate you, know. Don't thank me. Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it. It's a big fucking bird... Fun -- look at that guy... Fun, he's not going away; he's  scaring the piss outta me! I never was too good at this  domestic shit. Don't say "shit". That's okay.  Corn Flakes are okay.  Anything. Hey, shut the fuck up! Mom tried to cook. A lot of people "know" my mom. I don't know you. You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for? Right. You buying? He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention. What's going on...? I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even with the makeup and stuff you wore. You really loved her, didn't you? She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair. You look funny without your white face on.  Like it's your day off or something. I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours? Nobody ever gave me something like that before.  Ever. And she'll be alive.  Up here. You're gonna like it here. I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to -- Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here? He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said. We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open. I don't remember you.  And I don't remember inviting... Mom -- ! Gabriel! You go to hell, you pervert! Don't let me fall! Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean. You're not gonna come back, are you? You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww. Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new job, gotta go. You sure you're gonna be okay? At least it finally stopped raining. It can't rain all the time.
