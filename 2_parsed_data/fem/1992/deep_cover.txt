Playing... Yes, sir... Yes, sir. Daddy! It's a bunny... I don't want you to go away, Daddy. Tito did it. Television mostly. I was on "Sky  King" twice, "Ramar of the Jungle."  That was a silly show. The jungle  was mostly flats... You want my advice, I'd stay away  from that bitch. What the fuck I tell you about being  here? Too fuckin' late. Get down, motherfuckers! Seven. Twelve. Can you get that? Eight. Why can't I just use a calculator? Daddy! I thought we were doing my  homework. Daddy!! For you; it's Eddie. Mr. Hull... Mr. Hull... Now you know, Mr. Hull, I was to the  welfare this afternoon, but the bus,  you know what I'm saying?... the one  bus, and then the other, and when I  got there they'd gone and changed  the time on me, without notification.  They's supposed to give notification,  ain't they? They said I got a thing  in the mail, but I don't remember, I  don't think they sent it, so now I'm  off the welfare, plus I forgot to  take James for his shot... for the  school? Which otherwise they let him  go. And he's gotta learn, he's gotta  learn, don't he, Mr. Hull, you tell  him, so's he can better hisself. Now, Mr. Hull, if you just -- You now, I look out for my James  best I can, Mr. Hull, but it's hard.  Now you like the boy, don't you? I know you do. And I was thinkin' if  you wanted to take care of him, that  might be good for him. Give him a  male figure to look up to. If you could just give me something  for him. Say five thousand dollars... Or maybe four thousand. I couldn't  give up my boy for less than four  thousand... Or you could just give me a part  now... Let me do somethin' for you, Mr.  Hull. Let me do a little somethin'  for you. No solicitin' in the halls. I told  you that before. I ain't doin' shit. Bitch... It's too early. Don't bother me. Seven. Oh, yeah... Ten... Who's he? Come on, honey... What're you looking at? You want to suck it, bitch? Or drink it? Oh, I know you. You're the bitch  whose whore I wasted tonight, ain't  you? I gotta take care of you, too, huh? Daddy!! What? I miss you, too, Daddy... Nobody's home, go away. She got a fever and just burned up.  She just burned up all of a sudden.  It must have been bad stuff. Come on, James, we'll go get a  burrito.
