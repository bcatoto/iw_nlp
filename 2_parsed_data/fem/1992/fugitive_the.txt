No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr.  Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply  has no ulterior motives. Hello, Jim. That would be a little abrupt, don't  you think? I told my husband that he was going  to kill us if he didn't stop  operating. What with this AIDS thing,  he's putting us all at risk. I'm sorry, I have to get my husband  home. You looked handsome tonight... Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look  like waiters... You looked more like... a band  director. Are we home yet?... Call me on your way home. I'm glad it went well. I'll see you  in a minute. He's here... still in the house... He's trying to kill me... Richard... He's trying to kill me...  my head. My head. Richard my hold me. He's trving to kill me... Richard... He's trying to kill me... There's your fax... Good-bye. I love you. As of this morning Chicago P.D. was  alerted to the reappearance of  Richard Kimble. Police units have also increased  patrols around homeless shelters and mass transit stations in the city. Not that we found. Right... You ever been downwind of a  stockyard when the breeze is  blowing? That's where we were  sitting when Richard Kimble told that one... If this guy existed believe me  someone would've found him. Where's Rudy? Didn't they tell you to put up the  sign? Put up the 'wet floor' sign before  someone gets hurt. What did you say? Hey, Ricky... Weren't you just in  here? Hey, how're you doing? You find that sign? You called me an asshole. You worked at other hospitals? I bet it hasn't. See you. What happened? What about this one here? Okay, we've got to get some room in this hallway, people. Hey, take this one up the hall to Critical Care. Gladys, where's the boy I sent down  with the janitor? What boy? The one with the fractured sternum. He never came in here. Dave, did you see a janitor come up  here earlier? I saw - Do you have a particular interest in our patients' x-rays? I saw you looking at that boy's  chest film. What other hobbies do you have?  Brain surgery? I want to know how that kid ended  up in surgery. Bullshit. Who changed those orders? You stand right here. I'm calling  security. A little boy's alive today because  he did something. For what? U.S. Marshal's office... It' 9 Kimble on line three. His name's Lentz. A pathologist. I  only remember him because he died  last summer. It's kinda late to catch anyone,  but you might go by the morgue.  There's an old guy down there  who's been around forever. Okay. I want it locked down. Start  on the lower levels. Not since he took down one of ours,  Gerard. This is a police matter, now. Stay, the hell, out of it. Bring him down.
