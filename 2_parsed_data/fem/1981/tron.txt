Yeah, if you've got another quarter. Think we can merge into this mem'ry okay, good buddy? Now, ol' Flynn said to look over in here ... ...but I don't see what he's looking for. I'd better get over to that input/output tower and let him know. Uh oh...we got company. You said it ... one of those Recognizers comes after me, gonna hafta jump clear out of the data stream. Oh my...the long arm o' the law. No...I must've gotten in there by mistake, I - Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty Master Control ... you're not makin' me talk. Well, here goes nothing ... Well, I meant - Let me make sure we're running Looks good... How's it going upstairs? Did you say Group 7 access? Did he say why? Flynn had Group 7 access. Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it. I want to go to his place. I mean I want both of us to go. To warn him. That Dillinger's on to him. For being on to Dillinger. Hey, where's Flynn tonight? We have to talk. Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system? Flynn! You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old. I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to. Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does.. Shall we dance? You better get in back with Flynn. And keep down. I don't think I'm cleared for this. Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office. As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here... This laser's my life's work. Don't spill anything. TRON!! You're getting out of the business?
