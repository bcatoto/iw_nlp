I've studied Latin. Greek, too. Me  appelo Elspeth, filia regis. Please don't think ill of us. My  father is a wonderful man, a wise  man. The lottery was his idea. You don't understand. From the moment  it began, the dragon was tame. The  kingdom prospered. Yes, that's true. Isn't it better  that a few should die that many might  live? Oh, but we all take our chances. My  father is a just man. My name is  entered on the lists, along with  every other young -- Maiden. What do you mean? I've participated in every drawing  since I came of age. It's true. You don't believe me. You  think I'm lying. Well I'm not. Don't listen to rumors. They're lies.  I have to go now. Until we know. Not long. Goodbye.  Vale. Dormi bene. Father? Father: did you know that some  families have paid bribes to stay  out of the lottery? Have you ever kept my name off the  lottery list? Answer my question: am I not exposed  to the same risk as every other man's  daughter? Well? It's true! What have you done to  me!? This is your doing! The name is as you heard it and as  Horsrik read it: Elspeth. Hear me, good people! It is true,  that my name appears on many of the  lots. This does not falsify the  drawing, it certifies it! I have  learned that my name has been kept  from jeopardy in all the drawings in  the past. So I have put my name among  the rest many times -- once for each  risk that, over the years, you took  and I did not. Let it be! Please! Tyrian is right --  it's our only hope! Tyrian -- both of you -- run! Flee!  It's coming!
