I was tired and didn't have any place to go. Pris. Hi. I don't have one. They left. I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying. We scared each other pretty good didn't we? I'm hungry, J.F. I was hoping you'd say that. Whatcha doin'? Just better. Thanks. And you live in this building all by yourself? How old are you? What's your problem? What's that? Is that why you're still here? I like you just the way you are. As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow. Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is Rachael. It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit. But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard? You like our owl? Of course not. You're in a very unique position, Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the future of this entire organization according to how you work your little test. Are you apprehensive? For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share. Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell. Go ahead. I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police. I'd take him to the doctor. I'd kill it. Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian? I wouldn't let him. I should be enough for him. I'd never get an abortion. That would be murder, Mr. Deckard. It would be my child. Ugh. He's not ready yet. Tomorrow, he says. Was that your dinner? I'm sorry.  I called and found out you were on your way home.  These were already delivered to your department but I thought you should have copies as soon as possible. It's the Nexus information you wanted. I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help. I think you need more help than you've got. There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it. Two of us might be more effective than one. No you don't. You use your equipment, don't you? So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me. Do I make you nervous? I'm sorry. It's strange to suddenly realize that what you thought was your life is actually someone else's fabrication. Can you?  I couldn't. A part of me is glad.  I think I feel more.  I don't like who I was before. They probably want to find out when they were made. I guess the date of your birth is important if you know you're not made to last. That's my number.  If you need me. You better get better locks -- if you want to keep me out. Good night. Yeah? I don't know nothing about it. How do you mean 'exploited'? Are you for real? What the fuck for? I don't believe this. Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake? You mean the snake. The best. Come on. Jeezus! Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh? I bet I would. And what if somebody did try to 'exploit' me?  Who do I go to? And who do I go to about you? You look terrible, you know that? What do you want me to do? There's a lot I haven't done with a man before. You're getting me wet. This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian. And my Aunt Mary. And this is my savior, J.F. Sebastian, everybody. We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you. You certainly have a nice place here. Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much. We haven't found it easy, Mr. Sebastian. We're famished. Well? I want to know what's going on. Then we're stupid and we'll die. I don't trust him.  I don't think he knows what he's doing. If he won't cooperate? I told you I'd come back. You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping. Are you glad I'm here? Who is this? Where is he? Oh. How come you're not on the job? How are you doing? What do people do in the afternoon? Do you dream? I wish I could. I mean asleep. Did you cry when your father died? That's another thing I can't do. Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that. I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it. I don't know... I think I missed something. I'm not sure.  Is there a secret? What makes you think so? I think, therefore I am. I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us. When was the last time you cleaned this place? Have you ever cleaned your apartment? It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody? They could clean around the arrangement. But if I don't plug it in how can But then how can you... This feels stupid. You're sick, Deckard. May I help you? You and I are good friends, huh? It's so easy. Have you ever known anybody a long time? Uh-huh. Ten years. Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder? Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered? Do you think I simulated what happened between us? What difference will it make? You know what I think? That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me. You know what else I think? This was the best day of my life. Let's go while there is still time. Anywhere. Not to be trapped. Then go get him. I want to do it. Naughty, naughty.
