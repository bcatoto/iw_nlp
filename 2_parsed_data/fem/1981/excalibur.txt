I have kept it. I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky. And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy? And you cannot love me... Why can't you be my champion? Not you, my husband? No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness. Don't start a war on my wedding day! He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself. Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too. No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week. Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles. --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued? --I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once. It didn't hurt too much, did it? We are to blame. He has given up. --Nothing! Love demands it. To me? But why? Me? Who?! And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you? Why? The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping... I am the desert, where water disappears-- You provoke me, Merlin. Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man... Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me! You are truly magnificent! Why? People make you laugh? You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world. The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas... A lovestruck page! It's clear you are, and it irks me. Can it truly be used for magic? Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
