They're talking about the Curse again! I do not carry supplies. No one has ever come out of there  alive. Why should we put our faith  in you? But you did study under Professor  Ravenwood at the University of  Chicago? Well... you must understand, Dr.  Jones, this is all strictly  confidential. Yesterday, one of our European  sections intercepted a Nazi communiquï¿½  from Cairo to Berlin. We don't quite  know what to make of it. Here it is - "Tanis development  proceeding. Acquire headpiece, Staff  of Ra, General Tengtu Hok, Shanghai.  Locate Abner Ravenwood, U.S." But it says here that's in China. That's right. Hitler's a nut on the  subject. Crazy. He's obsessed with  the occult. ...where the Ark of the Covenant was  kept. What's that supposed to be coming  out of there? Dr. Jones, you've been very helpful.  I hope we can call on you again if  we have questions. That does it! I've been patient with  you no-goods long enough. I'm not  open at 2 o'clock for myself, you  know. It's all for you. And how do  you repay me: Trouble and noise and  blood on my floor! I won't have it.  Everybody out! Out! Out! We're closed.  Closed! Do your killing outside! And  don't leave any bodies on the porch! Hey you, deaf one! I said out of my  place. I don't mean next Easter, I  mean now - Get up and get out. Well you're two years too late. Go home, Mahdlo. I'll see you  tomorrow. Avalanche. Up there. He was digging.  What else? He spent his whole life  digging. Dragging me all over this  rotten earth. For what? Hell no. He's buried where he was  working. Probably preserved real  good, too. In the snow. Don't give me that stuff! What do  you know? I'm the one that was left in a bad  way. He didn't have a penny. Guess  how I lived, Mister Jones. I worked  here. And I wasn't the bartender. Finally the guy that owned the joint  went crazy. Snow crazy. They took  his away screaming. As they dragged  him out, he said the place was all  mine for life. Can you imagine a more evil curse? So far, it's working. I'll go back. I'll get there. Not  that there's a soul there who knows  my name or cares. But I'll go. And  when I do, they'll know me. 'Cause  I'm going to go back in style. With  money. A goddamn lady! If I knew that, you think I'd still  be running this dive? I'll tell you something Indy. I've  learned to hate you in the last ten  years. But somehow, no matter how  much I hated you, I always knew that  someday you'd come through that door.  I never doubted that. Something made  is inevitable. Why are you here... now... tonight? You son-of-a-bitch! You know what  you did to me, to my life? This is  your handiwork. I was a child! I was in love. It was wrong. You knew it. Why start now? How much? Gone. I sold it all. It was all junk.  The junk he wasted his life on. You look disappointed. I like that.  How's it feel? What are you drinking? Real man's drink. Me, I like scotch.  And I like bourbon. And vodka and  gin. I'm not much for brandy. I'm  off that. It's no act, pal. This ain't  Schenectady. You really have money? You don't  look rich. I may be able to locate some of his  things. I know who's got them. What  do you want? Maybe. How much? That'll get me back, but not in style.  This doodad must be pretty important. I knew it would happen eventually. I  knew it. Something had to go my way. I've got to think this out. I'm used  to bargaining with yaks. You word, huh? Just like you said you'd be back  last time? That was your word too. Come back tomorrow. Because I said so, that's why. It's  about time I called the shots in  this relationship. Wait a minute. Leave the five thousand  here. You want trust, give some. I want to  smell your money. You're an idiot. Hold it. Come here. That's right. Give me a kiss. Get out of my place. The bar's closed. What do you want? Why, are you willing to offer more? No. But I know where it is. How 'bout a drink for you and your  men? Fine. Why don't you come back tomorrow  when Jones is here and we'll have an  auction? Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know who  you're used to dealing with, but no  one tells me what to do in my place. Wait! I can be reasonable - You don't need that. I'll tell you  everything! Unbelievable! Not without that piece you want! There! You burned down my place! You owe me plenty! I am something. And I'll tell you  exactly what - I'm your partner! Why, thank you. I like you too. Oh, no! You don't have to have it  around if you don't want it - I'm surprised at you, Indy. Talking  that way about our baby. He's got  your looks, too. Hey! Hey!... where're you going? Indy-y-y-y! Uncle Indy, we have been looking for  you. Come home now, Uncle. Hurry! They were throwing me around like a  rag doll. No. Not since I got here. They just  asked about you - what you knew. The  Frenchman's got the hot's for me.  I've been playing that along. Oh,  Indy, get me out of here. What's wrong? Cut me loose! I said get me out of - I swear to you, I know nothing more.  I have no loyalty to Jones. He's  brought me only trouble. Don't put me down! What are you doing? Whatever you're doing, do it faster. Where are you going? What do you mean? Where are you?! Indy! Where are you?! Please Lord! The snakes... are they here? Do you know where you're going? Thank god. Where? Us too. What about you? How are you going to get that truck? I have a feeling I'm not the first  woman to travel with these pirates.  There's a whole wardrobe in there. I feel like a virgin bride in this. There are some things you can  recapture in this life, but that  isn't one of them. Nothing. That is the way it is. No. Then again, I burned up that  plane. And you saved mine. That's the way I like them. No. Not yet. What is it? Why? Oh, Indy! Thank god you're here. What about the Ark? Hell yes! We've made it this far. Slow it down! You've done your country a great  service. Quite. Thank you all. Thank you again. Well they aren't going to tell you,  so why don't you just forget it. I'd  think you'd had enough of that damn  Ark. Just put your mind on something  else.
