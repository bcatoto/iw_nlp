SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT Really. What'll I pin this on? He was a President. Indulge? Did you /hear/ that, Oliver. Look. Look at that. Bert Schnick can see. Why...he's...dancing. Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor. As a matter of fact... It pays to know your way around, Oliver. Are you spoken for this evening? Overreact! You're the one with theories about conspirac... Oliver? I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this. We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips! Conspiracy is right. The Denton Dossier is... Sounds like my husband. He never came back either. At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break. Conspiracy? That sounds a little farfetched. Bert brought them over from Europe. They had a very popular series together. It's still rerun in a lot of countries. You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?' Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde. Everything's free there. Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man. Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off? Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview. I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative? Oh, Oliver. What are we going to do? Shove it, Ralph! Not at all. You have your life. And I have mine.LITTLE BLACK DRESS WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS When do I get to see Brad? Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home? Is it because I'm becoming too popular? I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists! That sounds pretty drastic. I've caught it once or twice. I know, I know, it's just... He needs help. I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad. SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE What are you trying to do? Make Bert look like a fool? He's made all the arrangements. We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching. That's us. Brad! Oh, Brad. Who? What do you mean? I won't be a party to this. I want to see Brad. That doesn't make sense. Could I do that later? I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line. Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser. I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am. Why? Poor Brad. What show? It's... Oh. Mom. It's Brad. Thanks Officer Park...Vance. Janet. Janet Majors. It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and... I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale. I'm sorry, Officer. I NEED SOME I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME I NEED SOME I NEED SOME BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER? I never signed the contract. He's not going anywhere. BRAD! I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog. I've got a lot going for me. I'm going places. I'm going to be someone. I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it. I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you. I should be with my people... . . .For his own good. But what'll I do? What'll I say? What'll I wear? Do you really think so? If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me. Is it true they're all midgets with big heads? I want to see Brad. Me? I'm...happy. No...couldn't I do this later? No! He's never done that before.LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us... Surely. Hi! Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.I got it! I got it!!! Infantile regression. I got it! I got it!!! About Brad's family? LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits. Oh, Harry. What are we going to do? He moved all right! When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery. Well I hadn't. I was worried about inherited craziness when they married. I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?' He was adopted you know. TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON` You're practically naked! Janet! Where's that lovely dress I made you? Your father doesn't like Mexicans. You shouldn't have said that. Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents. Just what the Doctor ordered. I know. Come on in, my favourite show's just started. They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show. The Far East meets the Mid-West! I know. Oh my poor baby. We love you, Baby. Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby. We're not confused. And none of them worked?And how does 'local girl' Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things? Could you tell us a little about it? We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight. Is this true? Mr. Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
