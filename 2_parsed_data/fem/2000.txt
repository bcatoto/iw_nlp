This is nicer than your other apartment. My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer. Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time. Alright. I don't think so. I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time... You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it? I'm not supposed to. But I can make an exception. You just haven't been looking.Nothing. Patrick? Isn't that special? Patrick? Listen...Patrick. Can we talk? You never noticed. We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is... That's nice. What are you doing tonight? Will you call me before Thanksgiving? Oh God, just get it over with. Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS. Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip ï¿½ to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium? Take it off. Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light. Turn the light on. Pull out, goddamnit! Pull out. No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me. Luis is a despicable twit. Mmmm...thanks, Patrick. This is Dorsia? Are we here? Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up. I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... Oh God, Patrick. Shut up. A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. Pick me up? Okay. Yeah. What time? You like it there, don't you? Dorsia's nice. I can't. Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go. I know. Stop it. Uh huh. Yes? Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that. Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick. Stop it. I'm... What? Oh, I'm...busy.That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you. You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb. You think I'm dumb, don't you? Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it. Well... A model? An actor? So, what do you do?You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one? Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird. No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that? Does he do this all the time? Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation. Patrick, you re a lunatic. Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon. Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours? I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you. Who? This tastes weird. Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at- Why would I? He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours. Uh huh? If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob. Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?But where? Where are you going? Oh God, I can't believe this. No, no, no. You're inhuman. But what about the past? Our past? You're really serious, aren't you? But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work. You have a little something on your upper lip. Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee? Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about? Why? What's wrong? I want a firm commitment. Your hairline looks like it's receding. Are you using minoxidil? Everybody has a great body now. Everybody's good-looking, Patrick. Everybody's rich. Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price? Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist. Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work. Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly. We should do it. Yes, darling? Get married. Have a wedding. Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.What is it, Patrick? Are you alright? Why? Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong? Patrick? I can't hear you. Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks. Where are you? Patrick? Is that you? Patrick Bateman's office. And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21. No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go. I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go? Hmmmm. Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to? Sorry. Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy? What's that? Who's Ted Bundy? Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing. Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously? No, not really. Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure. Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower. You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit. Want a bite? Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some. You didn't give them a name. Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want. Oh, I can't. I don't know. Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision. Anywhere you want? Oh no. I have no plans. Yes, Patrick? Yes, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty. Detective Donald KIMBALL? Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you. Patrick? Thanks, Patrick. You don't like this, I take it? Ummm...what? I didn't hear you. Yes? You look nice today. I'll do it. Oh, something. . romantic? Yes, sir. Just say no? Oh? And what should I say? After six. And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17. Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why. Late?Don't come back. Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go. I think you should go now. There was no ad in the Times. You saw the ad in the Times? No, he doesn't. Can I help you? Are you my two o'clock?Okay. Do. Yeah. Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday? Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often. Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right? Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate. Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best. Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you. Your father is proud of you. I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him. I quit my job and we've been together ever since. The drinking is for the pain. It doesn't kill it, just dulls it. Not that often. He was excited to see you. Glad to meet you, too. You are all your father talks about.I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN." I perfectly understand where you're coming from. As a minority I can relate to your struggle also. But I think you should give us all a chance. We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness. He, I'm Mona.This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male. Voila. End of argument. It can't be racist because you're black. Thank you. And always smile. The Mantan Manifesto. Catchy ain't it? Number One. We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras. Two. Let the audience decide. Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four. Who determines what is black? Five. Mantan is a satire. Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em. The best defense is offense. First, I would like to say I love the show. It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.I won't forget. When are you coming up here to see your mother? You know how your Daddy is. No. Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success. I'm doing okay. Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once. I thought you said there would be no buffoonery. Peerless, last time, go see your father. Even more reason to see him. He'll be overjoyed with your success. Regardless, he still is your father. Richmond is not all the way down south. He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia. Yes he did. He wants you to come and see him. Peerless, your father called. I will. And good luck with your show. I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard. You deserve it. Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already. I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this? Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons? Son, Peerless is your name. Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate. If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless. That's wonderful. Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own? How's the food? I said no such thing. All I said is that something must be wrong. You hear me talkin' to you. The only time you come up here when something is wrong. You must think I'm some kind of fool.That's mighty black of you. If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative. You got your ways to affect change, I have mine. And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house. That'swhatI'msayin'. I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else. You don't have the demographics. What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's. Delacroix. Please. Who are you revolting against? Hook you up? The Mau-Mau's? You must be smoking. Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies? I order out mostly. So what do I owe this visit to? I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius. I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street. You must be crazy, Julius. Well you did. You idiot. You almost gave me a massive coronary. I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me. Don't make me have to use this. DeLa, kiss my big black ass. Work related or otherwise? That was a mistake, but I don't regret it. That's why it will be so much fun. That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light. This bucket of blood. DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light. I can't lie to him. If he asks me something, I tell him what I think. Please don't go there. He's just playing big brother. You're the one that put us together. We're friends. I don't want to hear it. To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human. It's all good. You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank. Plus, I love these old black collectibles. I thought it was appropiate. This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century. No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it. A gift. So you have your small victory, now what? Everybody shut up. I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's too funny. I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's. I should not have imposed them on you. The pleasure is mine. Just don't lie to me. We both lied to him. Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready. Break a leg. You've said that already. The big one. This is the group I was telling you about. Hello. Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal. Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it. What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up? Fuck da money. Why do through all this effort? Why? Are you looking for love from Dunwitty? For respect? Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you. So now what are you gonna do? Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made? What is your problem? You okay? Hello. Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death. Can't you just quit? Walk away? I'm in till the end. Sounds risky to me. What point is that? You lost me. Do you know how you will use him? The idea was out there in the universe. Now what? It hit me like a ton of bricks. Manray! It wasn't my fault. If I would have known, I would have known. Nobody told me anything. How was it? I envy you. That's the way I want to feel about my work. Why do you say that? You've never seen me. If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you. No, we're not knocking boots. I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant. What do you mean? A little. I just graduated from NYU film school. Cinema studies. I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while. You've never had any formal training, either? You can go now. Why don't you answer? Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa? That's ancient history. That has nothing to do with you and I. We did it one time, only once. It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid. Everything I've got I've earned. Say what, Manray? Just ask me what you want to know. And what? After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant. Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position. What? I'll be down front. You better start putting your face on. You're sure this is a good idea. Why don't you call him? I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt. Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up. They had no choice. They were considered 3/5ths of a human being. Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States? Maybe you need to start. You don't read, do you? Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface. You ever heard of Bert Williams? He was a great artist. I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'. Oh you do, huh? This is a nice place. It must have cost a pretty penny. Are you trying to rap to me? I'm an asthmatic. Been one all my life. Can't go anywhere without an inhaler. What do you want to know? Enough. People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.Keep painting. Promise me. Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch. Do you...have any more packages to deliver? You are. Yes you are. What gave you the idea to paint on that cave? I can't believe this. I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist. You're into something very powerful. Primal. Truly. He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him. Oh? You've tried? Yeah. A long time ago. Hmmm. Feels like it might have gotten wet. Want to come in? Get dry for a minute. You know what happened to this? Well, I have to say, I'm impressed. You never gave up. You came on a bicycle? No wonder it's so late.I've got lots of time. Must be a story there. You? Personally? What brings you out to the sticks? Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?I'm so glad you're alive. I love you, Chuck. I had to come. To be sure you were okay. I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals. What will you do? You okay? This is so unfair. You hated being alone. Couldn't stand it. Busy every minute. Always plugged into something. So simple to say, so hard to do. Come on. Try. Don't overwhelm me with the details. You know how I hate that. Yeah? Maybe now's when you tell me about it. Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted. Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing. What's that, written on the sail? All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me. What's that? No, this is Jack. Jango was hit by a UPS truck. Can you believe it? Her name's Hannah. I didn't want to. It just happened. One day Gary was there. He took care of everything. He took care of me. I was a mess. If I'd known you were alive -- I would never -- I got married. Right back, you said you'd be right back. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Go on. We'll be fine. I'll feed Jango to the frogs. Chuck, you're breaking my heart. Get back? From where? Don't even start. What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad? Don't tell me you're mad. Be mad. Be who you are right now. Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was. I burned the Christmas tree. I'm sorry about the presents. I got a little carried away. There isn't any us. That's your dog. No. "We're" not over-reacting. This isn't working out. You want to. You can't go now. A ring. I wanted a ring. For when I travel? A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish. He's your cute thing. I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of -- Let me guess, Russia came up? You don't seem too happy about it. Merry Christmas eve. Yeah, tell me. Tell me all of it. Chuck. Chuck, forget the Xerox. So Russia didn't turn out well? Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that. Did you get it fixed? How was Russia? My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed. Your eyes are puffy. Did you take Valium again? Sonofabitch!There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney. The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow. And how was your Christmas?What a journey you've had. It seems more than a person should have to bear. This is my home. I'm part of the wallpaper. Roger got me on. I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back. I would have come to Memphis, but -- There's settled folks, and there's nomads. You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here. I'm doing fine. Don't you even think about it. Oh no, the prodigal son's home. We bring out the store bought. That new roof, that's your doing. It seemed like she had such a good time last time. What happened to your pants?I don't want to see your hospital. Not today. Leave me, now sir, I am tired. Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws. One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them. Don't condescend to me! We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind... Some things must never change. Oh, indeed? You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes! They beg you to consider the future. What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!? Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army. There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal. They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests. Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now. It's an anti-Christian dogma! I cannot believe you are so calm about it! Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church? And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally? What with all the rumors getting back to England. I thought she might inquire after us. But then I believe she always looked down on us. That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you... When you lived with the Fairfaxes? You're no fool, George. You never have been. And, what 'prize' do you see? What could we possible gain? Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say? If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory. I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed... Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you! They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you! Our marriage is a business just as surely as... My God, what? But to go to war over trade, over money? Surely there's still time for a compromise. War? No! I did not! When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable. There's no middle ground at all? We're the King's children! My God, these people mean to go to war! They really mean it."Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..." Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all. You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers? Now that is a lie! See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet! When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William! Do you hear? You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love! Is it? William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial? I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you. And what is this, then? Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot? Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!? George, you know I only love you, but... Is that the truth? Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer. Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children. You won't have to do anything at all! You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself. Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world. Except for that, quite like home; England, that is. Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you! In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you. So, you are William's wild young neighbor? Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family. I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated. Voltaire, of course... Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong." And dost thou live to ask it? I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre. I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee. Those people? I doubt they'd think of this. Ooo, you're wonderful this color! Why? Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still. Let's get you darker! I don't laugh at you, George. I like you. I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings. And to think I am teaching you to become one of them... Is it? Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom. Do you? When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped. The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it. Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it. You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid. It's stupid, of course. That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see? Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements... In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes... The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'. Capture them? Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious. Africa? That's so far? How do they get here? Where... do those men come from, George?You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands. Do you want posters, too? Not yet, dear brother... You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero. You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd. "... by the emperor of Rome. This writer asks: between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?" "... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..." If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want. What are you talking about? The fans of Narcissus. They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying. Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother. The people have bread and the city is quiet. Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you? You're coming back? You can't do that! You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you. Why not do it in the Colosseum? If I may be so bold... Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father. Except that he can't heave out his ghost. Those are priceless sculptures. No one in Rome has ever heard of him. Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have? The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with. Forget about him. I'm sure, I don't know. If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne. Maybe you should get married. Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability. Don't you think you should at least wave? And Caesar! Let's not forget to serve Caesar! I was suddenly thinking about going to bed. I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon. That's what you told me two days ago! Where are we now, Commodus? Can you see the camp? My Gods! The air is turning into ice! Hidden. Where my brother cannot place hands on them. He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all. The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe. Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive. All of them. Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son. You cannot die. "If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..." Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children? The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans? For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men? How like my father you are. You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive. But you do exist. Narcissus: hero of the battle of the Danube. I came here to see that you stay alive. The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero. It's my brother's neck you want, not mine. Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it? The Emperor himself, didn't you know? Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front? Burning patriotism? Filial love? He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor. Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful. How do you know I am playing? Well, the clown is always harmless. Isn't that right? And how did you ever get to know me so well? The last we spent any time together I was fourteen. I think you know me better than my father. He's going to die, isn't he? Why do you keep playing at being so humble? It's a little embarrassing. Without him. He'd be weeping if he overheard that. Well? The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting. I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities. You know our two most senior Senators: Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus? Narcissus! Terrified? You? The only thing he's scared of is me.You teach them! Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you! I don't want you to die! Narcissus! You're not going! You have to stay with us! No! I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen... I never knew a more idealistic man than you. Let him trust Quintus. We don't need your help we're doing great on our own. Who else? I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome! Or for the glory of you! I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become. The battle is over. The war is over. You've won! You need to come home! They're studying with Cynics. Athenians... Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers. Isn't the helmet magnificent?I beg your pardon? That's right. Kevin. She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister. She lives in Australia. I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister. Really. I don't know.Would you? Really? Wow. I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home. And the new label? And the Kinky Wizards? Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?" "Music for Old People." What does that mean? What's his name? Nice friend. That's five. So. Why did you decide to deejay again? Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time. Fine. That's great. Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter. I'll do one. My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger. Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing -- Nevermind. Any five. So four more. Is there a difference? Your desert island top-five. Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records? Right. So. You must have an enormous record collection. So. Is now a good time? I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay. Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now. I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you. I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.What are you talking about? Where's Rob? Hey, Barry. No. No. Mom wants you to come to the funeral. It's on Friday. Nothing to resolve, Ian. Let's get a drink. Mmmm, no. Not a good idea. I'm upset, but I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm off the phone. I am fine... I gotta go. Goodbye. It's gonna be fine. These people are ready for anything. Well, you've asked. I mean, maybe you're right. But were you really expecting me to say yes? I've changed my mind. That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do. I will. About what? So? No. I don't think so. I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough? Very persuasive. Don't sulk. What brought all this on? No. Probably not. Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet. I'm sorry. But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you? I know. Ha ha ha. Hoo hoo hoo. What are you going to talk to me about? Right. Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out? Are you worried about tomorrow night? That's okay. You seem pissed off all the time, though. We took care of that. They'll go on early. Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour. Yeah. His band is playing a set. Barry said its done. What do you ever do that can't be cancelled? I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore. It might even be why I came back. Just local, of course. Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record. Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release. I called Dan Koretzky because he -- I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great. I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way. I know. But you've never met. It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him. At Paul and Miranda's. Paul from work. Wanna go to dinner? Hi. What are you doing? All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself. Otherwise, what's the use? How? What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice? Yeah, you're alright. But you're certainly not happy. So what happens if you get happy? And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable? What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend? Less neurotic. Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life? More confident, maybe. I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink. And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so. You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you. If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs. But what? Because I'm not allowed to. I still do, after work. So, what? Should we just break up? Is that what you're saying? Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience. How? How were we the same people? Money does not matter. I do not care how much you earn. I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like. I'll pay for you. Even though you owe me money. We have to do something with the money I earn. I need to. I deserve it. You can just think of it as winning the lottery. ... Like Mexico. Or Jamaica. Or New York, even. Look, Rob. If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay? To make you feel better. Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying. Look, we're okay now. We just had a nice time. Let's leave it at that. What's the difference? It was like sex. What else could it be like? Want to know what, exactly? Let's go home. Okay? I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure. I just... I need you, Rob. That's it. And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so... Ray's a disaster. I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart. Everything's too hard. Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't. I'm too tired not to go out with you. I lived with you. You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry. Isn't that a terrible thing? Isn't that sad? Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about. Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again. I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today. Hello. It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here. It'll have to be sex, then. I want to feel something else than this. It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire. Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm. I don't know. Sometime. Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me? C'mon. I don't want to go back. I didn't mess things up because I was scared. I slept with Ray because I was sick of you. And I needed something to snap me out of it. Thank you. I appreciate it. I can't reciprocate. You're also an idiot. You're soaking. Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night? Liz'll give you a lift. She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob. I've got too much to do. Look, are you coming or not? I don't care. As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand. My dad liked you. And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know. I don't really understand it. I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on. It's like... He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to. In a minute. When I get it together. I'm sorry. My dad died. My dad, my dad. Pig died. Pigsty. I can't talk right now. Hello. Well, think about it. You're being deliberately obtuse. I'm sorry to go on about it. But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it. They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you. I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand? That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me. I like Sting and you hate him. But the rest of this stuff... Who the hell is Nick Lowe? Or Gram Parsons? Or the Boredoms? I don't know these people. I... Those aren't mine. Oh ho, so very infrequently. Mmm hmm. You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at. But I already knew you could make me laugh. It's everything else I don't know about. Ray. I hate Ian. You know I didn't mind. And it's not as if Ray's place is any better. Fix it up. It'll make you feel better. You know what I mean. I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest. I'm sure. He's at home. Listen, I can't believe he went to the store. I'm mortified, actually. I'm really sorry. He had no right to do that, and I told him so. Yep. I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them. I called and called but you were out. I thought I'd be gone before you got back. You don't ever think about other people? I'm not experimenting. Why don't you go experiment. Jesus. I do not know. I'll talk to you later. I'm not -- hold on... I figured it was. Where are you? Hello. Call me at work. We can arrange to meet properly. I don't want this to be the last conversation we have. I know what you're like. Will you call me? We can meet for another drink if you want. So I can explain it better. I owe you that much. And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it? The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob... Are you there? What are you thinking? You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared. Like you said, I've been living with the guy. We were bound to get around to it sometime. Oh, Rob. What do you want me to say? Is that why you wanted to see me? I told you I slept with him. So, how are you? We'll talk some other time. I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff... Hi. I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me. Have you seen them around? Will you please just go? No. I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love. Not yet. But I'll tell you one thing. The sleeping together is better. I haven't felt like it. Well the answer is that I don't know either. We haven't done it yet. You really think it would make a difference either way? Jesus Christ, Rob. Is that really what's bothering you? Is what better? Better than what? Just ask it! Nevermind. Fine. One. I'm too tired for this now. I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up? I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here. Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation? -- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have! Oh, Rob, shut up. I suppose so. I don't know. Look. Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me. Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know. All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here. I am not living with him. I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else. You know that, don't you? I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it. And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go. But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run. Probably nothing. Rob. Don't be childish. Did you say something? What? I guess it's not that obvious, then. What's the obvious stuff? What were the others? What? Gimme a fucking break. Is that what you think? That your not big enough a deal for me? Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob. I'm sorry. I haven't been very fair to you. That's why I came here to the store this evening. I feel terrible, Rob. This is really hard, you know. I think you know that. Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet? And do you like it that way? You really believe that? Yeah, sure. More so then than I am now. That's life though, isn't it? Well, I liked you. You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one. I remember the song. I just couldn't remember who sang it. Is that right? I'd like a word with him. -- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway? -- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye -- It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records -- Yes. Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things. I thought I could give you a lift back. Hi. I should be so lucky. We've done the hard part now. I might as well, you know...If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do. Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time? Enough of what? No. They don't know him. And Ken liked you. Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know. It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story. What difference does it make? It's a crematorium. Rob! Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her! You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back! And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!" To think I sympathized with you for two seconds! Poor Rob! Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs. You let me believe that! -- No, no, no, don't even. I talked to Laura, Rob. I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE. Yeah. Like I said, I don't want to take sides. And I like Laura with you. She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together. I just wish you two could, I don't know. I don't think much of this Ian guy -- How're you holding up? You called this morning? Hey. It's Liz.Right. And so it is. I'll talk to you later. That way. You? God, you ask a lot of questions. Good. So you'll stay? Jesus, so much for delicacy. I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz. I'd like it if you could stay the night. When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff. Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket. Good. In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink. You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee? For now. But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening. Are you okay? You haven't even seen it! The Conformist. Yeah, I know the Crumblers! I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it. My everything changed for a couple of weeks. Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd -- No way! I'd cramp his style. And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall. I'm way to unattached for that. Yup. Thank you. God, I hate that time. That pick up stuff time. I just went through that before I came here. You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play? That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections. Everything go alright? Don't you like that? Yup. Not far from here, actually. Good. 'Cause I'm enjoying myself.Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes. You meet someone, you move in, she goes. So you say. I'd like to hear her side of it. What did Laura say? Do you know why she left? I knew this was going to happen. And after that? I knew this would happen. What are you going to do Rob? You know that's not what's upsetting me. Well call her mother. What do you mean? Where did she go? Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep... How's the store? Everything all right? Hi, Rob. It's your mother.Okay. Because you took the trouble to come up here. And because you've got principles. But that's it. I'm not selling them to you one by one. Sure. Ten cents. Fine. With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want. And I won't take a penny over ninety. Seventy-five. Sixty. Suit yourself. There are plenty of others who will. That wasn't part of the deal. I want to be poisonous but fair. Years. This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement. He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old. A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me. Can you make sure you give me a five? I want to frame it and put it on the wall. I must have nothing. Their my husband's. I know what they're worth. Give me fifty and get them out. Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours. What do you think?I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in. All these good people have totally been led astray. I'll call her later. Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him. Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now. You're already there... It would be so okay. I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do. Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have. Yeah, you do... She's so nice. We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look. Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back... Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye. That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi." It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer. Angels don't get any older, son. Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair. Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel. Try an angel. A mountain goat? That's really sweet. Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom? Maybe try the opposite of that.She goes to Parson's, right? Show him Central Park. You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life. I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris. So excited.Yes, great movie... You keep a bat under your seat? You followed him? Oh, that's terrible, Reege...I love you. Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that? Nicky! Don't do it. "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..." We're going to Jersey? Can we go fly over Central Park? Okay, I do. Get back up here. ..."The Devil?"... Yes... What do you mean, "possessed?" Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger. Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am. Why would you be floating? What are you doing? Are you dead? What were you thinking coming here? Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there. What was that? What? You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool. Basically, yeah. Sometimes, sure. My perfume? Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty. I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog. You have a dog? What kind? This town is really going to hell lately. So what part of the city do you live in? It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it. "Octopus people?" If you want to. That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati. Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out. I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older. My dad's an optometrist. Why are you laughing? Really? I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from? That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.Go, fo' I change my mind. Just tell him to come over here and talk to me. Yo' cousin, Craig. Hook us up. Okay, I know what I want this time.Hey, how you get out of here. We must be here 'cause we stopped. Ezal! Ezal! Me neither. How far is Rancho Cucamonga? What? Keep pushing. William. Just do it. If you shut up I'll tell you. The urgent message is...Drop everything! Craig is in trouble. Come quick, don't call. Here's the plan. You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones. Get on! Get on. Rancho Cucamonga? What you say? Where did Craig move to?You alright? Next time, page me first. So what? Let's make'em wait. It's locked. Easier said than done. We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us. Thanks for noticing. It used ta be peaceful before they got out. Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown. You did all this for me? What?? So you snuck in my room to tell me that? What are you doing here? Better sooner than later. I just wanted to give you this. I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning. They're assholes. Hello, remember me? I don't know. My brothers won't give me a ride. To the Cucamonga shopping center. Karla. 'Take your car?' Are you going to take me to see Mom? Hey, what's going on? When? After you get all drunk and loaded? I thought you were taking me to see Mama?Why for? Them boys are real player haters. Peace out, Craig. See you later, Day-Day. Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you. Strange activity. I think they running drugs off Tijuana. Day-Day don't believe me. Well, then, it's all good. Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street? I've been seeing a lot of activity. I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy? My name is Miss Ho Kym. Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass. Nice to meet you, Craig. Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?Whatever you say, man. I didn't see shit. The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all. If you say another word, it's over. I'm not playing! I said shut up! Now who sent you? Shut up! Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass! What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?Sheriff, I don't... I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE! IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK! I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid? ...I meant your food. Hey, Sheriff. How's everything? 'Kay, good. Bye, then... Hmm. So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet? They're fine... you miss it? Oh. How come? No, I was just... How you doing? "Banners?" I don't think I am. I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but... Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think. ...what're you saying? I'd rather not... This is really awkward... I better go check on them. WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG! I'm sorry. I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something. I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?! I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am. "Thirty-two?" Umm, I don't think that... I am? ...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here? Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs. I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something. I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband... ...I... I know what you are. ...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something. This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together... Umm... yes. Back home. Yes, ma'am. It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background... Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista. Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but -- It's not true. He was set up. I gotta go. Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this. What are you talking about? Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note? Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me... Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it? All the time... Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit. Are you and Larry happy? I gotta go make dinner. Yeah, me too. He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it. Maroon. I stole it. What? Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year... It's all right. No... what about your sister? I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar... Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style! Did you watch it yet? ...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about. ...George. I do. My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime... Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord... Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane... My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been? No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I... ...I'm sorry. Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't... I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?! David, please -- What do you mean? What did I do to you... Why are you doing this to me? David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second? Ad lib? I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it? Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise... ...but I love listening to you, so that's okay... It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something... I know, that's why we were meant to be together... No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot. Was this before Leslie? Before us?... You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me. She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men... So where are we going? I know. It's up to us. Of course. I just want everything to be perfect between us. For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year. I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old. You told me that two hours ago. Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up... She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me. Lyla's very nice. Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here? Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain. Why do they keep calling you George? I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words. There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared! He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable! You knew Del?! No, Del. The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat -- But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life. We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now... And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David. We were engaged. ...of course you do. You don't remember me? I don't know. It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives. I came for love... Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del? Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new. Oh, I know. So, who're these clients? I got you, Del... Or the vitamins? Or the...? ...like the water purifiers? I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax. I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but... Sure you don't want any salad? What was that? I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and -- Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath. So, call me when you -- It's not really a good time, guys... Ahh, look, right now's not very... Roy! What are you doing here? It was Chloe... Yes. Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting! What're you doing here, Roy? You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem... Make sure it's elevated... I'm great, good, content. What happened to your arm, Roy? Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning... To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me... Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it. You made out alright. Like Rome? I'll go to the Hospital. No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon. Dr. David Ravell. How did you know? No. Loma Vista. Oh. I mean, except for that. Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good... I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop... I left my husband two days ago. That's horrible! Did you love it? Europe? The Europe? This is my first time out of Kansas. Los Angeles, California. I'd slap his face. Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess. Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it... I begged him to let me put that on! ...did I win some contest? I married a car salesman. Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie -- Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it? I don't think so. Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did. There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God... I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't... Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there... You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh... I have to leave now. ...this is your sweater, right? I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know. Oh, he does that. It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George. Rosa, so you've met David? All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that. You should have a little faith in people. Rosa... Are you sure I can borrow this? No, almost never. Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before. To a party in the Hollywood Hills. Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know... He is real. Oh, God! You scared me! Yes... Looking for someone? Umm... What are those for? ...okay. Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break. Fine. HE IS REAL!! Why'd you help me in the first place? If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money? Shhh! I heard you the first time. I have no idea what you're talking about. What? Where was he?! Who? You said in L.A., anything goes. How many men have I talked to? Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you. David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm... No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia... It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head... Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated. I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie. His wife. You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place. Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.' Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes? The Five? Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County... Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men... It's lovely... I really like your aquarium. The one you were telling me about? No, that's not, I couldn't... No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner. It's something I had to do. For David. I came for love. My fiancï¿½ is here. I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas. LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD! I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once. He has no heartbeat!...who doesn't? If it helps bring her back, be my guest... No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this... Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile. Oh, five years, give or take.If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me. I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry. Betty was a lovely child. This is Betty at twelve.You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you... Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived... Worse. What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be? Piss off, Merle. So how you gonna find him, Betty? You mean... George McCord, the actor? What's his real name? I s'pose his name's David Ravell. Nice move. Cedars Sinai? Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas... Really? No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me. Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage -- Sure I loved it! It was great. I should call you Dorothy. When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went. And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go? When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy. Where you headed, Betty? I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any. If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him. Shut up, Merle... Williams. So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you? He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick. What's the matter here?Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels. Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright... You must be joking. I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess... How's things at the Tip Top? Great. Good. Content... Need something else? You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something. Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will. He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back. Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!... No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley? What did you say? I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway. Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight... No... before that. Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too. You're wastin' your time, Roy.She called you 'George,' George. No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you? I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer. I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it... But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name? Then do as you're told. Get her back. Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident. You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer. This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months. I SAID FORGET IT! All right, everybody! That's ten minutes! Is there a problem, George? What the hell's going on? "Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember? Actually, she was my discovery... just like you. I said I'll think about it. I'll think about it. I don't know, George... No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember? We know that... I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good. Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do... Funny, that's just what I was thinking... Are you sure you want to encourage this? No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"? Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy? Loma Vista? You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?" God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of? Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again? So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County. So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name? What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?These guys are here to help you, Betty. Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise. Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this... What?! That you had something to do with it? Your husband?! What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on... Where are you going? What are you doing? Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George! Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital? Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is? No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral... But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him! Betty, you are one-of-a-kind... This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want? I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools. Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world? No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go? Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about? Does he know you think he's real? You still in love? Were you with him this whole time? You never know who you'll see. Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with... So what do you say? Can we be friends? This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid. I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can. I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL! IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!! You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character! I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you. I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!! Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?! ON TELEVISION!! Cut the shit, will you! Doctor David Ravell. Guess who I saw today. I was talking about what you could wear! Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me! Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that? "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out? Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever... One of us should. ...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories... We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission. Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy... Her 'head'?! You're making this up... God, that's awful! He has a wife?! What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people! Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit. You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy... So, how'd it go today? You find him? Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want! We're still on for tonight, right? Just look for the really crowded road and follow that. Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five... Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits. Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat... No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street... I got this apartment with a guy. Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay? You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down. Man, that is love. 'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him? So why'd you come to L.A.? You don't sound like you're from here. ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!! You're hurting him!! What are you doing? Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air. I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it. David Ravell. She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas. Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself? Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.Betty! Listen to me! Del is ... Do what? Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy. Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me? Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright? Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine. Well, you are. All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are? Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose. Let me know if you need anything, okay? Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday... Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive! What? The LeSabre! Aahhh... So what color is it? You sure? Maybe next week we could... I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon. Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast. Oh, Betty -- Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort... It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her. Is this Neighborly Life Insurance? Mr. Campbell? I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around... "A Reason to Love." No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back. No. Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it... I wish I could help you, but I can't.I counted to three, honey. That wasn't my doing... I don't care if it's ninety thousand. Uh-huh. Well, we need that ring. Or in my chiffonier. I don't know. Or, it might a been under the mattress. I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk. That's one of Aunt Hurlene's. That's not my ring. That's not my ring. That's good, honey. That's right, honey. No weddin'. Ain't gonna be no weddin'. We ain't gettin' married with his ring! You said you'd changed! I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels. McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned. I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train! No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you? That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.Thank you. Late summer. Good. Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy? Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl? I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning. Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow. Next time we'll bring more blankets. You call that a compliment? It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month. I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.Lovely. Goodbye. Very well, then. Do you? I said, I'm not my sister. If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own. Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed. You couldn't have known. And send us to war alongside Massachusetts. As do you. Thank you.But what about Thomas? We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm. She's to the west. How far away?Yes, I do. I hate him and I hope he never comes back. I don't care. I hate him. He left us.I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think. Then what's he doing here? I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth. You've been to his quarters, haven't you? We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo? I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound! Was ever a man more risquï¿½? He wants to take me every way! Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouï¿½! Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow! And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind! I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!" My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal! Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows! At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy? Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy. Yes? Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible! Well. Go on. Come now, darling, give it a read. If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories -- He's a writer, not a madman. Once or twice. No one's forcing you to listen. "And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --" Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching. You'll hate me now, won't you? What? What've I done? Why not? Mother's not half so blind as you. It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here... Don't turn us out, Abbe. I've you to look after me, haven't I? I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name -- He's not the man who's cast a shadow here. If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life. I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess. Ow! It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest. Don't say that; reading's my salvation. I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink -- His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all. Yes, Abbe? Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil? You asked my name once; it's Madeleine. I'll be waiting. I'll pass the word on, then. Here it is; the last chapter. It's because of the Marquis, isn't it? I'm only a laundress; not a detective. "Well worth the dig!" "The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..." "A habituï¿½ of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years." It's not your cup of tea, Mama. ...yes, I've got that bit... A tale more horrible than all the rest combined! -- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper! Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval -- Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both! You could whisper it through the walls of your cell. It needn't be; not if you've another story. He's a man of God; he's true to his vows. The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you -- I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations. It's only been described to me. In your books. They've taken your clothes? I don't believe it! What have they done to you now? What's that then? You demand a lot from your readers, you do. It's a long story, this one. Oh, you. You talk same as you write. Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them? Is it terribly erotic? Is it awfully violent? Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript. There's something else I want from you. I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis. I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours. You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind? Don't start --And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose. Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own. Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows. Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet -- If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails -- I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you? Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him. Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick? I am eternally in your debt. Don't toy with me, Doctor. It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag... Oh, but I am! What thought is that? It's tainted money, Doctor. I am not a wealthy woman. I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should. Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms. You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case. I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane. Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy. He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name -- Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again! Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins? You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt. To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage? I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself. How was I to know, my darling? Forgive me, I beg you -- ....shame on you, truly...Gabriel! Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree... He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand. What, he should see me help you catch him? Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck. One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas. -- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that? We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth -- To all those cons... He wants... your "sister"... No, baby. He wants me. Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said... NO! You promised me! Gabriel, you promised! YES!!! Please, Gabriel, don't... Don't hurt him... GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM! Gabriel! What are you doing here?! Gabriel, let him go -- Gabriel, what are you doing! Gabriel -- ! Thank you. I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not? C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon. Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults? You said it a million times! You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you! I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick -- What are you talking about? What? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Rudy. Who wouldn't. You shouldn't have. You... you... YOU -- WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK! We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember? They all are. Football's on. No. Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it. How are we gonna do this, Nick? He says he wants it now. He wants to see your map. Part of... with them? Nick, what are you talking about? I don't know... What? I love you, Nick... I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry... I saved you because I love you, Nick. Why'd you save me? You saved my life. You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me. Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years. We'll get there, baby... we'll get there... Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here -- Nick, the ice is -- Nick, what happened -- That guy knows you? So does it look a lot different? Nick... We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this... They're truck drivers. What? No. He wants to be working for himself someday. They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads. Not without you. Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants! I hate him, Nick... you know how... No! I thought we'd have a few more days. He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant -- Jack. Jack Bangs. Gabriel! Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this! I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know! If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work! I love you! No, Nick, no -- Nick, please, it's me -- My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead. He'll kill you. Nick, it won't work. It won't work! Nick, I love you -- Nick, what are you -- Nick -- Nick, no -- He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters. Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job -- He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not... I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore. Nick... NICK! No, lover. I'll see what you can do. Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane. We could live it up and -- And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun? Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there? Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho. You forget where I work? You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas. No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat! You need a COAT! Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby. So don't talk to me about little white lies. Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick. Hurry up! Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions! What's good?! Then he shoulda signed his name. I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words. Yes it was all you -- Not bad. Just regular. You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things. All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn. A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way. I told you, Nick. Remember? Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to. Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean -- No, c'mon -- No -- What. No, no, no. Be like you want to be. Thought you wrote you had a mustache. You are to me. Saw me -- Saw my outfit or something, my coat -- I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way -- Radio said. Yeah. Radio said negative five.In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away. No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise... I don't know. I found him lying there. It's not. I can't take it. I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back. I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is... My father. So you're going to kill him? I don't want to see! Yes I do, I really do. It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead. ... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said. When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right? But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you... Yeah, I know. No! Why are you haunting me? My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life. You killed Lauren! You killed her! I know who you are. That's why you paint your face. To hide. You killed that cop Dutton. Daisy. How did you know? Stay away from me! Dad! Dad! How do you know? You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him. And he's right over there by the way. What did you do to your face? Yeah, no kidding. I know her friends. I'm never going back in that house again. Get away. I don't believe you. Don't call me that! Don't call me anything! About you. Stay away from me! Stay away! You killed her! You're in with them. I think I dropped an earring. He said he'd prove it. That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren. Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us. The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car. What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was! This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face. Watch out! It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time. Stay in the car. I'll only take a second. I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it. Why are there so many?I do. Every day. She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?! You killed my daughter. You mean Alex. Please. Come inside. I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me. Sweetheart... About them. You've got to leave it alone. They killed her because she found out. Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen. No. It's not what you think. Looks like you have them both on. It still doesn't mean... Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message. What? What is it? What is it? Are you ok? What were you yelling about? Erin! Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you. Honey. I just can't. Just hold on to me.Look, can I just call a cab? You want me to walk a straight line? Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her. Not tonight. Honest. She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before. Anything wrong?I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you. A thing like this... who could even think of winning? If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or -- What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you. What's happened? When are you going to be home? Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.No. There's no one here. Better luck next time. Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately. Her dog, yes. You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well. I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did. And your wife left you. That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently? How long have you been smoking marijuana? How long have you been having them? So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand. You did.It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence. No, it's not that, it's... I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep. Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book. It beats 'What's your major?' I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner. I told you, Sewickly Heights. Who does? Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in. At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet -- He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one. I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so. I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck. Grady! I thought we were going to talk. Last night. The one in your office? It's the best one for naps. His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside. James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but... Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember. Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it. I would if I knew where I was taking him. I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home. So what are you going to do? And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am. I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down. James'll know about George Sanders. Ail right. By the way, his friend...? Just checking. I think so... What about you? I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage. I haven't heard of half of those. Just a few then. The big ones. Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how. Are you riding with me, James?It's a bathtub. What she's standing under. He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a... You mean because his career's ruined and all? That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit. What's that? Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind? Tony. Now that I'm home. Sure it is. Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed. Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing? I need a ride. Who's he barking at now? That's a nice greenhouse. Why yes. How did you know? Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.I know, but sometimes... Did you just make that up? It didn't come up. I told Walter. Some times... Oh? Dozens. It's very sad. And you're old. Oh, Grady. You're such a putz. Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all? I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady? I said it didn't sound like you. He told me. And what do you think you might have said? You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady? It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning. This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady. Are you sure you parked it there? Grady. And the jacket? I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady? It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed. I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong... What's he doing out there? Who's that sitting in your car? That... and you. No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet. I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore. Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk. All right. Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere? Are you limping? Why are you limping? I'm kidding. Hello? Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom. Did you confess? You heard? How? Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too. I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick. I love you, Grady. Pow. Heavy. Smells like gunpowder. Who's gun is that? No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying... ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady. No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way? She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby. You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her. Don't. I know what you're going to say. Almost. Want to sit up? What's the matter? You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right? I guess you're going to have to chew it off then. Neither do I. And? Are you going to tell him? Has he asked to see the book yet? My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she? Is that Cristaile? So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple. She's left before... I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising. I'm sure. I'm pregnant. You go first. Walter just got it back from the framer today. Well then. I'd better show you. Terry -- That's funny. I need to talk to you, too. Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp. I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things. I got the message you called. Professor Tripp. You want to keep him happy. I doubt it, darling. I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else. Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady. Goodbye, Grady. Are you there to not reconcile with her? Just what? Doing a little dusting? With Emily? You're in Kinship? Where are you, Grady? An elevator? Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.Nick!! Please! Please...? I haven't done anything. --my God, Nick??? I'm not a witch, you're all crazy! Closer. Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts. My eye, is there something in my eye? Don't know--just that she was afraid-- A coward too. That's why she had to go. --bad boys, mean boys, cowardly boys--just like Domini. I don't...I don't understand them myself. Join the club. Because it means the tree is older than the house. Hey, folklore-- --which she may have-- I just wanna go home . Her father's Sheriff of Taos County. Inside the grave? What're you doing there? Domini? --he's not my husband! --I'm not staying here! No! I guess-- Something was wrong. I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it-- I killed it-- Why? --Nick!! I haven't killed any-- Looks like business is booming. That's a joke? We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway. Oh, sorry, right. Not the only things missing, Nick. So whoever built this-- No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation? Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers. The Witch's voice. I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume. No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good. She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her. Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again. --it's called "morning sickness," asshole-- --Christ almighty-- Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal. Down or off--you're giving me a migraine. --fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole! --what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with-- Why? --no, what's wrong with you? Whatever you want. --no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me. I can't. Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling. I get dreams. I don't like 'em. No. What? I guess, yeah. Nothing. I dunno-- Sleep. --Cotter's-- Get your goddamn-- I'm not going anywhere, 'til-- For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a chance ? We've looked at half of one tape. No idea. But if that's all we've got left-- I want to see the tapes. --or someone-- Yes. I don't know. Nightmare. I don't know. What? --fine, later, fine. You feel no need to get married or anything. Why is there no "our" here? You don't want it though. Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing. You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days. It was free --I recall that was the chief selling point for you. Oh, c'mon --even you have to admit this is weird. -- whoever --they built an entire house around a tree . Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me? --do you agree it's that old , Nick? That's a sapling-- this mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum. What is this ? You sure? --doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there was a Blair Witch-- No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy-- What? She is --she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico-- Domini. Domini Von Teer. It's like traveling back in time.Bullshit! Talk! --Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds-- You killed Domini, didn't you, witch?? No. Not that I can see. What, are you alright? --Anna-- What happened to her, where did she go? What do you mean? Try, please, Anna-- I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys. 'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended. Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who cares ? --or incredibly fucking naive. --and if she ever did-- Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine. Doesn't say--it's just these pages. --it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message-- --I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore-- Who? Goes right along with these two. That's a "j." --one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn end to it. Nobody's going anywhere-- --before you lose your emotional lunch. What -- --Domini! The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with-- --I saw what I saw. What the fuck--?? It's freezing . How's she going to know where to-- Where? Boy Kurth. You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to? Cotter? --Cotter, where can I get on-line? Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees. Well, she got out of here some - how because she's not here!! Fire escape?? Where's Domini? Gimme it! Where is it? Still don't see it-- English. Su casa y shit-o hole-o. Too busy eating us? --Cotter: shut up. What about night? Me, too. --yeah, a hand or something-- Get out of here! What're you, crazy?? We should be so lucky. Try a long walk. Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada. No fucking. Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night. What I never could figure about the movie? What movies? If you're looking at me, look elsewhere. Never would've guessed. Nice tent. You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn child . Shut-up. I take it back--she wasn't an actor. She's a nutjob. I do. Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor. You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you? --which'd be about ten bucks-- --fuckin' A right-- What're you afraid's going to happen? I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out. No big deal. I'm just trying to understand. You gonna be alright? I know, I know-- Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out. What? What? ....I don't know. Dad...? Elly Kedward? What is it you thought you saw on that tape? At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide. Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back. Cotter'll kill you. For a blur? What'd you see? That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back. What's that? Women miscarry all the-- And what's your excuse for being here? Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy. Like a blueprint for disembowelment. --the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine are ! Does she, goddamnit?? Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had? Not this one. "It's why the witch kills children." --fuck Anna! No. We all go. You're needed here--keep watching-- Check the monitor, she's fine . You know what we picked up in the woods-- Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth-- Gothic rune--the letter "S." I can't do it! We're not dealing with fucking logic here! Why in the world would she -- We are being fucked with here, someone or something. Spare me. What? That feels good. Lower--down into my neck. --it's not a could've--there was , Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here with us in this place now . And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our brains . Shoot. Yeah. --a lot . I'm sorry. She's off her fucking rocker-- Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn doctor . She wasn't a witch. Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie-- The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch. --she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil-- --his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!-- --the Sheriff's Office-- I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico-- His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning. --it's urgent! Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer. No. Yes. What happened to my Dad?? Who is this??--thank you for calling-- --yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?-- --yes-- ....Ma'am? Could I tell him what it's regarding? He's in a meeting. Could I have him-- Good morning, Sheriff's Office.You do? He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating. Why? Yeah?I get the imports. Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben. Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard. I get all your CDs. Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two. ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN? I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS. I think it's funny. If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop? I never fucked Rod. I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?No! Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye. No I wasn't. Who is she Daddy? You know her? She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa. It was a she. I thought you'd be pleased. You are upset. Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?! Not much further. Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS! A little. Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses. What do you mean? What's wrong? I will. Is that all? No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now. I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything. I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird. Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler. Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends! It won't happen again. What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME. Daddy you scared me! Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you? You're the killed. Yes. _ Your father raped someone? What do you know about my father? Me? Why me? Really? You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston? Of course I'm scared. You know about that too? Sure. Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car? I am. I can't right now. Stag? Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time? You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight? I won't. Ok. No. What party? What? FINE. Are you? Someone tried to kill me. NO?! Not that many. Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us. I promised I'd go right home after school. How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you. I don't know what I'm so scared of. You're the one always saying 'Just do it'. Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out. He says he loves me. I was desperate. It was gross. Does she fuck? But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'. You are 'sp fucking' wrong. You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars. You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now. You eventually have to talk to him. You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents. Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday. Mark Shale. Go sit next to him. No. You Miss Dunlop? Don't you think it's sick? You heard about that? This place is empty. Twenty eight years ago. Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers? What are you doing? Oh GOD IT'S HIM! Thanks for coming back for me. Go to the police station! My dad's down there! Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore. What? This party is sick. And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat. You flaunt some slut in my face. You break up with me because I won't fuck you. I'm making you feel like meat? What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong? Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now. So I should feel happy that he got away with it? I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit. My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist. I'll think about it. I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom. I do not. I'm not using him as an excuse. No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me. I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded. Did Sharon say no? Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party. Yeah. I think it's really sick. I did. I'm fine. What? I got to get home. I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago. Cut it out. NO! THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them. Who was the fourth? The principal? You're not telling me something. The men. Do any of them still live around here? Who were they? The word is Mob. How could you? And the police did nothing? People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'? Why not? You didn't believe her? Attacked how? I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead. Wait. Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me. Who is she? The library. I'll be fine. No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen. No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight. That's what he said. I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer. Yeah. Who is she? Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman? I need to ask you something. Mom? Hi mom. His mother's an only child. On what side of the family? Kenny's aunt? Yeah. Yes?This will relax her. Did you warn her? Well? She just turned off her light. What happened? Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have... Yes. Mr. Sisler was one of them. Two men left town right after it happened. Who? I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd. I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town. EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY. They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today.... They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'. No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged. She was raped. At least that's what she claimed. Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors. What? Don't make me order you. She's nobody you should be concerned with. I want you to come home with me right now, Jody. Where are you going? Not that I know of. I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind. Did he say anything else about her? What? I don't know. Where did you hear that name. Lisa Sherman? You can ask me anything. Yes? Hi princess.You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different. Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old? Not at all. In fact, I thought about going. Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day. Everyone's getting ready for the party. Follow me. They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for? Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?You're not? Daddy.... Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety. Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on. I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go. Unless he makes a move during seventh period. It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time. Especially not your dad. You can't tell your parents. Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard? Mark invited me to the party. Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what? You ok? The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could. You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale. There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night. OK. increase the peace. I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference. Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . . That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend. No! Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me. Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you. Oh nice save. I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties. He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him. You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you. You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff. What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?' No! That's his table. Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years. The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too. I don't watch him eat everyday. Why? Who? You're the one who's hand is shaking. So are you. No, you keep one. Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one. You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick. Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben. And she didn't?What? What are you doing? I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem. What? You ok?ROD! Unfair?! Rod! I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod. I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out. If sheep don't count. Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming. What? Maybe you better just drive me home. I said no.Um, Erin? Listen. Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ... ... sometimes you're not half-bad. Don't use language with me -- Where've you been? Erin, you've been here three weeks. If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you. That's a joke, right? ... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files. That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that. We file 'em all here, alphabetically --All of 'em? Who? Nothing you can't show up for with a stain. It's those files you asked for. Right. Lap-dancers are people too. Erin Brockovich. Car accident. Not her fault, she says. And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think? He's a low-life. Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there. Tequila. From your drug dealer friend. His dry cleaners. You want him? Tony Marvin.Oh my God. Oh my God. And get someone to help around the house. I can put them in a good school. I don't even know how much money that is. Five million dollars? Oh, my God. A number for the whole group, or for us? It's a good day. I feel good. For what? Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea. You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman? No. Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said. He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other. Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me. They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine. And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous? An on-site monitoring well? That means -- Not around here. This is a rough part of the world. Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck. It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this. Heck, even our dogs up and die. I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor. But hunh-uh. Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other. It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there. The chromium. Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off. Cause of the chromium. You bet. Paid for a check-up for the whole family. And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either. They just took care of it. Just like that. We never even saw a bill. Well, they paid for the doctor's visit. Are you kidding? With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk. I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place. So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point. Thank you. It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know. And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy. Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts. All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you. I know. They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease. That's a kind of cancer -- Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains. Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy. You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have. Thank you. I think so too. That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing. I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it. And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over. I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ... Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it. You're a lawyer? Yes?I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you. What the fuck did you do with my stuff? Anna? With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that. Oh, hell. I'm dyslexic. That asshole smashed in my fucking neck! He came tearing around the corner, out of control -- What? Hey -- he hit me . What's your point? Yeah. There's two. Why? Which one? Yup. Any school you want. It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough. Five million dollars. And he's making them give five million of it to you all. Both. The judge came up with a number. Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop. Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now. I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ... You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna? Sure you are. You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire. Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E? I know. But the toxicologist I been talking to? He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list. Yeah. It was right up on the PG&E property over there. Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick. Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick -- What's chromium? The what? Wow. Why would they do that? They did? Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place. Yeah, I can see that. I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff? I'll say. Holy moley. Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that. Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up. I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records. They kinda surprised me -- Right. Yeah? I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey. This is a real nice place you got here. Hell, no. I hate lawyers. I just work for them. You got a minute? I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe? Hi. Donna Irving? Two million dollars? What is that? Ed, I swear, I'm not -- I wasn't gonna -- Here what comes? Yeah. Yours is nicer. Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone. How do you know that? Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this. Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself. Say you were wrong. Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed. I got a little something for you, too. You know what, Mr. Potter? I completely forgot your birthday this year. And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight. So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you. Morning! No, I'm serious. You know what Kurt Potter is? He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million. He doesn't work like us, Ed. There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing. Fuck Kurt. Why not? The fuck I'm not. I don't care what the doctor says -- Okay, good. I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than -- When? Where? Fuck legal terms. We're talking about human beings here. Sick people. A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years. They need their money now! We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed. We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to -- I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be ten years before these plaintiffs see their money? Wait, what do you mean, ten years? So why would PG&E offer it? And if you had to guess ... Between 50 and 400 million, definitely? I know. I'm sorry. Do I get to hear what happened anyway? If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy. Perks? Jesus -- perks ? Bullshit. You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me. After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get. How dare you take that away from me. Not personal ? That's my work in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time. If that's not personal, I don't know what is. "Fun?" Jesus, " fun ?" I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?" And, what, I'm not serious? Kurt thought? What about you? Do you think anymore? Bullshit. You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you. People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" -- If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off -- Not in my world. Why the fuck should I respect her? She insulted me! Why good? Counts? What's a demur? Holy shit. Who do they represent, God? Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money. Do you think we'd do better by going to trial? ... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills. So what are you thinking? Whoa. No shit. What kind of things come up? You might want to think real hard about the amount, too. My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake. I want my paycheck. By the end of the day. Fuck you. Make time. Cause I bust my ass for you. I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you. And what do you do for me? Huh? You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once? Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing? Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had? It's my paycheck. Which I earned. Which I deserve. Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me. Yeah, I mind. You bet your ass I mind. I want my fucking money -- Yeah. Yeah, I'm ... fine. No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things -- I don't know. Big. Dark. Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking. Get me a beer. Someone's following me. Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh? D'you get his name? Course not. Jesus, Ed -- Jesus. They look like the Secret Service. Yeah, I heard that one before. If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off. Well, good, Ed. I like working with you too. You didn't care about my case? Really? It makes me sick. Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is. Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and we're the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things? That's just not right. Oh, they knew. They had to know. What do you mean? Don't give me that. You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent. We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here. Yeah? Then gimme another raise. No -- For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them. That was his job. I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please. See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground. But guess what -- It didn't help, but no. The real problem's on the bottom. They covered 'em over. And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock. They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive. Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds. No . She lived on the plume. You never know. Another raise wouldn't hurt. And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I? You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry. Kinda like David and what's-his-name? Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967. A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then. Four more. Eleven people. So far. Okay, fine. I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference -- We can get these people. With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall. And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry. Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too. That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids -- -- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it. Bullshit. Okay, so here's what I'll do. I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard. That's crazy -- why not? And I realized, he's taking a chance too. I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward? Boy, do I know how you feel. First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me. Forty God damn percent? Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom. They'll be driving around the valley for hours. And you can't? I don't get why they'd do that. At least they made an offer. So you think we got 'em scared? So far. But that place is a pig sty. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more. Ten. There's a lot of other places I could work. I want a raise. And benefits. Including dental. Course I did. Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh? And you fired me . Jesus. The ones in the box of files. The box of files? The one from your office? It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong. They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad. You wanna know, you gotta hire me back. I got a lot of bills to pay. Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people. Now, why in the hell would you assume that? Well, that was nice of him. Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax? Oh, yeah? What are you doing here? Bullshit. You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed. Fuck if I'll help you do that. Don't bother. I left a message. I've been dealing with that real estate thing. I was gonna write up a whole damn report and -- I guess I'm not the right kind. Excuse me? Yeah. I got it. No problem. Out to lunch with the girls. Give her a cold washcloth to suck on -- I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit. Sorry. My kid -- I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry. Oh. Okay. That's okay. I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck? Just -- for the weekend. I'm not everyone else, Mr. Masry. I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on. I trusted you. With my kids' well-being. Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything. But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming. I don't need pity. I need a paycheck. And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn. So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me. You said things would be fine, and they're not. There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to. You did both. You never called me back. I left messages. Yeah? Well, fuck you. Sorry doesn't feed my kids. Settle down ? I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry! I can't afford to settle down! Bullshit. You told me I'd get half a million dollars. You told me I'd be set. Oh, please, it was long over by then. God damn, he made me look like some cheap -- Open and shut? Open and fucking shut ? ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen. Just wanna take good care of my kids. You know? ... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months. ... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids. They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck. I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now. How come you didn't say anything when you found these things? What do you mean? And you were told to destroy those? And ...? Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed? Did he say why? The fuck you don't. No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you. People are dying, Ross. You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it. I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night. Hey, Ross. Tell me something. Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart? Ross -- you are an absolute angel. Not anymore. Nope. Maiden. I wish I knew. It's for my boss. He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places. The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself. Would that be okay? I guess I did. Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records. Ross. Real pleased to meet you. I'm Erin. Thank you very much. Aren't you a gentleman? Mr. ... County water board. All righty, thanks. Hunh-uh. What's that? Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley? So that stuff -- it kills people. Harmful, like -- how? What would you get? There's more than one kind? George! What are you doing ? Where's George? That's not true; we had dinner together just last night. Look, I know you're mad. But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them. Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes. Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet. Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure? We're going someplace you never been before. Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch. Put your napkins in your laps and eat up. Hey, Ros. Nice view, huh? Hey, Ros, where are they? PG& -- Are you sure? What's going on in there? So did I. I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god". Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin. Brockovich. From the file room? I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office. Cause her own mom's real sick, too. Yeah. She is. But you know what? That's why I'm helping her. So she can get some medicine to make her feel better. Oh, God, sweetheart, no. There's nothing on Earth I love more than you. Nothing. I promise. I never forget, honey. I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short. We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay? Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise. God damn it, Matthew. What the hell are you doing out here? Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house. We'll see. Thank God we got you away from her, huh? There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town. It's impossible. That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes. Annabelle Daniels. 714-454-9346. I said, whose number do you need ? Whose number do you need? Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay? I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will. Excuse me -- Theresa, was it? There are no holes in my research. Hey -- those are my files -- I will. Bye. No, I need my car -- What time is it? Yeah, but I'm gonna get better. A lot of these folks aren't. You know me. I pick things up real fast. And I miss you. I don't know. Few days. Thanks for helping me. I appreciate it. Hunh-uh. Not yet. Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay? Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere. It's not for me; it's for my kids. You're the only one I trust them with. Hi. It's me. I got a favor to ask you. Thank you. They said that'd be tomorrow. They just wanna keep an eye on me another night. You already packed up your stuff? I need it. I can't. Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me. Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say. I never had that. Ever. Don't ask me to give it up. I need it. I can't leave my job, George. I'm sorry. I'm just working so hard -- What's that? About what? What's going on? What are you doing? That is not what I'm -- What do you want to talk about instead? Your day? That's a fascinating subject. No, I wanna say hi. That's Ed. Cause it's my office party. If you had an office, I'd go to your party. Just a few more minutes, then we can go. Take her, will you? What? Beth? My Beth? No, no jokes, I gotta pee. Just tell me about your day. What went on back there? I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road. Keep me awake, willya? Keep your voice down. I didn't say that. Nothing. How would you know? No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them. But you know what? They're wrong. I'm not in danger. I have a dead bolt. Remember? I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George. I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it. I am doing the best I can. Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life. They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now. George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off. Could you please not give me a hard time about it? No I'm not. Look at me. I'm not. Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be. I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect. I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes. Did I tell you that? You live next door to a real live beauty queen. I still got the tiara. I kept it cause I thought it meant something. I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life. I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone. Doesn't matter. Doesn't make one bit of difference. Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so nothing ? I can't call an exterminator. I can't afford one. God, I can't even afford my phone . I got fired. What kind of person lives like this? Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats? Great. What are you doing here? You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this? Thanks for reminding me. What're you doing? This isn't gonna get you laid, you know. You're around every afternoon? Right. Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids? It's been a while. Maybe I'm just out of practice. I hope that's not supposed to impress me. Yeah? And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund? Great. Another deadbeat. I'm never here. I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat. Yeah. I'm probably ruining them. Cause I don't even know you. I'm not gonna leave my kids with you. I had a good neighbor, George. She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free. Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that. Return 'em. Maybe you'll get your money back. No. Yeah. Sexy, huh? And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is. Seven is my son's age. Two is how many times I been married and divorced. You getting all this? 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account. 454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it. Sure. That's one of my numbers. It's how many months old my little girl is. Shit, yeah. I got numbers coming out of my ears. Like, for instance, ten. Which number do you want, George? You want my number? Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine. Well, I'm the neighbors. There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up. What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise? A lot. But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one. Jaguar's a darn pretty car. I'm real sorry, Laura. That's okay. I understand. Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights? What? Where's my paycheck? I am not talking to you, bitch. What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds? What's going on? I had photos of my kids, plus a mug -- Someone stole my stuff. I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are. I thought maybe you'd know. Uh-huh? I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything. What? It sure could, yeah. Thanks a lot. Yeah. Who are you? Wow, that's soon -- You're moving away? When? What? It'll be fine, yeah. Hi, sweetie. Were you a good girl? Where are Matt and Katie? Don't go telling anyone. It'll ruin my reputation. Uh-huh. Spent the last few days knocking on doors. And you know what? They're not. I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff. And their pets are fine. So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water. ... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too. So I went and asked. Their parents, I'm pretty sure. Right, I guess those are the kids -- No one put me up to anything. I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions. Who's Baxter? Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich. I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it. Dr. Paulsen?You're clever. I'm sure you'll think of something. I moved payroll onto the computer. It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night. Have you been logging on? Excuse me ? Yes. It's called accountability. There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them. Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay. -- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose. Here. Nice to see you, Erin. We've missed you. What do I look like, Erin? A library?I don't know. It happens all the time. Yeah. A real moron. I'm gonna hate it. I hate it too. I hate this trip. Mommy, can I get a flower? How come you're not eating?I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine. I don't even know how much they cost. Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin? A Jaguar. It's just -- the pain. It's only getting worse. I can't be a good wife. I can't be a good mother. I'm embarrassed.Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other. I just figured it was something in the genes. And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ... You know that thing it says in here about rashes? I know. It's an awful lot. There's something else, too. When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too. Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?I know. But it's good for me. Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too. Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door. Next week. My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me. I'm going to move in with her. Ai, bueno. Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries -- Outside with the sprinkler. So it's good?Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here. Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it. Does anyone know anything about these phones? In the conference -- Yup. They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane. Some meeting. With PG&E people. Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day. Hey, just so long as you see Him. You've been reading for hours. Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here -- Annabelle Daniels. You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart. Everyone's. This is a lawsuit. We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs. Erin. You don't even have phone numbers for some of them. No offense. There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask. Yeah, we had them couriered over. And listen, good work. They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyï¿½re all panicked here... Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodyï¿½s here. That'll be a nice little holiday treat. No?! You almost married this woman. Aren't you even curious what she wants? And look where it's led you... I'm gonna get her on the phone... Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy. So you left her? Just like that? Excuse me? You? Married? Yeah Jack, her assistant... Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight. Oh, and Oxxford called... You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.Iï¿½m not worried, Mom. Heï¿½s still learning our ways... Mary Janes, Mom. You promised. Mom, donï¿½t you think we need to open the presents? Rise...and...shine...! Is it morning yet? Ringing my bell... Mary Had A Little Lamb. Thatï¿½s good but...you did forget the anniversary. Mom liked it. One year he had a solar system named after her... Not bad...I shoulda warned you. Dad always does something really special for their anniversary. Thatï¿½s where you work. Big Edï¿½s. Bye... Try not to be late because kids donï¿½t like to be the last one picked up. I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty. This is day care. Itï¿½s where babies go when their parents are at work. You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains? You know how to make chocolate milk? Do you like kids? The aliens...In the mother ship. You look just like him. They did a pretty good job. Whereï¿½s my real dad?Okay, youï¿½re right, weï¿½ve been dancing around this for years... Are we finally being honest? Are we what, Jack? Need a nurse? Very funny. I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something? Mushroom puffs arenï¿½t the only thing I do well... Cï¿½mon, as soon as I put them down, youï¿½re gonna grab a couple...you always do... Finger food...? I thought I saw you notice it at the kidsï¿½ recital. Like the dress...?Fightingï¿½s a part of it, Annie. You know that, right? Thatï¿½s right. Okay, letï¿½s make a quick stop at the kidsï¿½ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then Iï¿½ll run into the linen store... Weï¿½re almost done here... Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present... Youï¿½re jumping, sweetheart... Donï¿½t do this, Jack... But he continues... What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay? Jack. Jesus, Jack... No, Jack, I never got married. You? Not with what they pay me... Thatï¿½s the one... Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Iï¿½m going to be heading it up. Iï¿½m moving to Paris...it was right here... Itï¿½s a box marked ï¿½Jack.ï¿½ I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army... Donï¿½t worry about it, Jack... Itï¿½s good to see you... Jack...God, itï¿½s been so long...You look... I promise. Come to bed, honey. I promise, Jack... Are you okay, Jack? Youï¿½ve been Jack Campbell. And thatï¿½s always a good thing... Itï¿½s been interesting, thatï¿½s for sure. Donï¿½t do that... Then get a goddamn snow blower! Jack. I canï¿½t believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didnï¿½t want to raise the kids here? Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job? Annie goes to a great school. Are you out of your mind? What are you talking about, Jack? A perk for what? For the week? So whatï¿½s the big surprise? You didnï¿½t rent this place for the weekend, did you? Itï¿½s like a museum. I could stay here forever... Thatï¿½s all I wanted to hear... I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack... Way out... I donï¿½t know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off. You know champagne makes me do crazy things. What are you sure about? Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you... God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player... I mean yes, I help people that need it... My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youï¿½ve seen my pay check. Cï¿½mon, Jack, you think there arenï¿½t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Iï¿½m doing in New Jersey... I think itï¿½s good to be a little unsure about who you are. Itï¿½s very human. And now...? Worse, you mean... Now Iï¿½m worried...just say it. Whatever it is weï¿½ll deal with it. Okay... You are so not off the hook yet, slick. How do you even know about this place? Jack...can we afford all this? You actually forgot our anniversary. What are you talking about? You never wait all day. You can barely wait until itï¿½s light out. Enjoy it, sweetheart... I found it at an outlet store. I know itï¿½s a knock-off, but I think itï¿½ll look great on you... No, open it... Jack. Nice, Jack. Youï¿½re sweeping me off my feet. Then say it...just say it to me...! Cï¿½mon, you know what I like to hear... Say it, Jack... Itï¿½s good, right? You want the cake!? Sorry, Jack. Itï¿½s too important to me. You mean this chocolate cake? How was the game, honey? If you want to look at it that way... Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you... ...who knows what wouldï¿½ve happened if you hadnï¿½t stepped in at the store. The trek out to the hospital every day didnï¿½t help either... You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing... You canï¿½t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village... We were young... Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to? Good, Jack. Maybe weï¿½ll keep her. I think it worked out okay, donï¿½t you? Well...Annie for one. Maybe youï¿½re not. The Jack Campbell I married wouldnï¿½t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thatï¿½s what itï¿½s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kidsï¿½ college fund. Itï¿½s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack. Really. Excuse me? No? Those shoes were twenty five dollars. Cï¿½mon, take it off. Weï¿½ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like. $2,400?! Are you out of your mind? I mean...wow...off the charts great. Look at me like you havenï¿½t seen me every day for the last twelve years... How can you do that? This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming... Thanks, Jack... Itï¿½s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youï¿½re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We donï¿½t have time for wining and dining. That is the general idea, yes... I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed. Jack. I said the kids are asleep... And...? ...my feet are hurtinï¿½... Youï¿½re having a bad day, Iï¿½ll go with you...actually, thereï¿½s no way in hell youï¿½re gettinï¿½ me back out there... Fine, sheï¿½s the kidï¿½s dog. Letï¿½s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her. Sheï¿½s your dog, Jack. Here you go... Jack... Uh huh... Funny, Jack. Iï¿½m laughing on the inside. Because youï¿½ll be here. Telling my mother she doesnï¿½t have to stay with the kids. You look forward to this party all year. Whatï¿½s with you today? Look, we donï¿½t have time for this right now, weï¿½ll talk about it later. Now get dressed... Youï¿½re not wearing that to the Thompsonsï¿½ party. I donï¿½t care how hilarious you think it is... Jack...donï¿½t even start... The city? New York City? Why? Where were you? What kind of man does that!? Are you okay? I can't seem to let go of you... We're being responsible. Go. Get on the plane. Go. Iï¿½m sorry, you should just go... Right, for us. But...Iï¿½m afraid that if you get on that plane... Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you... Donï¿½t go, Jack... I know weï¿½ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong. I have a bad feeling about this. I also put side two of London Calling on there... Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way... I found it! Yes! You didnï¿½t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you. Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.Congratulations. The La Guardia flightï¿½s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what? Iï¿½ll go for a cup of coffee! Maybe itï¿½s by the wardrobe boxes... Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here. Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead. Not yet anyway...Come, letï¿½s get you some help. Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city. No... You know you could never satisfy me the way he does... Hello Jack. You donï¿½t have to stop singing on my account...Merry Christmas... Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning... Okay? Don't you have anywhere to go? I'm taking the train... I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey. Would you like to come? It's Christmas Eve, Jack. I'd like that, too. Thanks. You're not bad yourself... Last night was great... Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?No! No! Don't! Police are coming. Get out! Get out of the car! Carter, get out! Can't you open the door?! Stop the car! Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house. We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house. Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us. Nothing is... anymore. Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away. Most kids never have it happen. Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence. I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane? That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to. Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach. 4:25. Like... 4:25. No. Thirty-nine. As in flannels and plaids? Ohmygod! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD! He's not dead? I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson? Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to. Then, let's go see him! Is that something you're "feeling?" "It?" That's why I was there last night. Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction. Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex. It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you. Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming. Almost like bein' able... to see the future. He's not a witch. WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW! I know what you're doing! It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now. Get control of yourself! Not with us in the fuckin' car! Knock it off! He didn't say nothin'. Just drive. They're watching me, see if I go to Alex. What are you doing?Oh, 'cause you got it like dat? No you didn't, you ain't provin'it. Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good? See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that. How you treat them? I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls? So what you think of me? That's it? So wadda you do with your girls? Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man. A play-ya. So what's her name? So you got a girl? Whadja wanna see me about? Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos? You know somebody around here? What are you doin' here? So watcha doin'? Um. Yeah! Shorty! Hi. Wussup? What? Do you have a name? Who are you?Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop. Is it true? There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up. God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand. For once in your life have some respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'. I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated. Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is. God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you. Why you have an attitude for? Look at me. Aaron, how you doin'? Yeah. Like this? Um, yeah I think so. I think he's 18 or 17. Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me. Yeah, he got a bad attitude. Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-I know how ta get him back if you want. You gotta girLfrLend? You live around here? Where you know Amanda from? Hey! You wanna do somethin' with me? So, then whadda ya want? Nothing. Probably. One of the many. How do I know you're not lying. So what do you want with her anyway? Your friend must be misinformed. Positive. Positive.Okay, then dance. Show. Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa? Yeah, that's right, you got it girl. You gonna talk to him? How old is he? You said before, that he got boxes? A bad attitude. How does he look up close?Frank... Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years! Put it under the loose floorboard by the window! The future guy? So am I. I'll be upstairs...if you want to play. I know. He loves that thing. Honey, what is it? Just tell me. Okay... Do you know how much I love you? I'm off. Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow. I love you more. Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work... You give him his drops? Where's Johnny? Frank...what's wrong? Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight. Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there. He did. Butch called. How was your tour? You didn't marry Donna Reed. I think I ruined the sauce...again. Damn. Well, why not a little of the King? Hey, bud. I'm sorry. I didn't realize... But she knew, John. A mother knows what's in her son's heart. Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh? Are you a good cop, John? You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts. My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman. Right after he retires from the majors. We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday. Hey, future boy. Frank tells me you're a cop? You work too hard, John. Oh, I loved it. I wish you'd gone. Close. Fine. You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month? I'm sure everything'll work out. She really loves you... I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it. I thought it'd be nicer to eat here. Hi, this is Julia. Please leave a message after the tone.Thanks. Wilton Estate. At me friend's house. No. Yeah. Yes. Working at Woolworths. I left last year. They said he was drunk. Yeah.You coming back? What you going to do? And that'll make me feel better? Not much. What, and get myself beaten up again? No. Are you tired? Did you sleep well? Uh-huh. Do you want breakfast? Are you awake? What's that supposed to mean? How'd you know I wouldn't? What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody? You're a bastard. What you going to do? What about Keith? Thorpey nearly died laughing. And what about you? Did you kill Brumby? They bloody hurt me. What'll they do to him? No. You sod. Now just a minute... Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it. Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know. I'll call the police. And what you going to do? Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort? Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy. And who's he? You don't look it. What the bloody hell do you think you're at? It'll cost you. Is he staying the night? What is it? Ta. Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday. Will this do? Are you a traveller? It never is. Her husband docks tomorrow, does he? I see.No. The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know. Your brother? What you talking about? Expect so. Yeah. Yeah. Shouldn't think so. I don't know. What girl? You've been watching the film. You sure about that? That's why you waited for me. Especially when I play the lead. Now you're asking. Entertaining. He won't. He thinks I'm simple. Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant. Brumby. We're there now. Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come. Nasty. You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited. To the demon king's castle, of course. A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky? You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you? Could you please put my glass on the table? Could you do me a favour? He was here for four days. Yes, while he was here. We went about together. He came to see Mr Kinnear. Oh yes. When he came up on business. Yes. I met him last year. Yes. Sid Fletcher. I know him too. Do you? You know Sid Fletcher? You know Sid Fletcher?I don't know nothing. It is. Honestly. It's the truth. He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both! He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street, I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday. He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do. Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not. Why all the bloody needle? He was gentlemanly. I like that. Once a week? Yes. I can't help the way I am. Yes. Nicer than most. He was all right to me. I can't. I must go. I'm in a hurry. Killed? I don't know anything about it. No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know. She's nothing to do with me. What about? Everyhing go off all right?I know... I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ... And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ... Every day. I wonder about that every day... Tuesdays ... The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ... Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself Of course ... I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ... I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he? Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ? oh. Have you seen him? What are you doing back? You look good...What's that? Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me... This time it's for real? I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and-- Where to -- ? What are you doing... ? You okay -- ? Where to -- ? How is he -- ? You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ... Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ... No worries ... What about The Club ... ? Wrong preposition... I bet you say that to all the girls... Of course you are. You're a professional... Cut 'em... They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills... Woo-woo-wooooo! "Unlock my button" ... ? You're going high-cheese, dude -- Oh, God... Stop. What about Maserati Boy? Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ... I think so... They're just... So ... She was so great, why'd you leave her? So, you seeing anybody? Deodorant. What the hell's that -- ? No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ? Oh, yeah. Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps! No ... ? Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process. We were good when you bailed, weren't we? You mentioned that in your letters That's what I want ... I go with you -- She's trouble -- Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ... She was the only "Annie" you could find? The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno... Hey. Hey - What the hell are you doing -- ? I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ... And you got some Italians -- ? What kind of trouble -- ? Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part - A distinction worth noting ... No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember? On account of me. No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch... Mitch. Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend. Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ... You look like you lost your sheep ... What's with the look? What are you doing here?We're still going to be together. Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you! She's been stalking you, Peter. Honey, you're exhausted. Do you want to lie down for a little while? Must be a spare set. I don't know. What are they? This is the person...you were talking about? There you are! My God, darling, I've been so worried. Are you alright? You need to believe in something besides yourself. Well, it shattered your faith in everything. Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic. No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out... I don't know. In a way, I'm glad it all happened. Thank God he did. I'm still shaking. When did they find her? What? That's horrible! I spaced out. Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day? Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this. Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there. Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings? Peter, where are you? You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight. Quarks and dark matter, things like that. Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know? I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early. Sushi. I must really be slacking off. Hungry? Bad? You never said anything to me... It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet. How'd your interview go? I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally. I missed you. Eight. That okay? You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it. ...you wearing a watch, Father? Frustrating. Form over content. Everything's so retro. Peter, are you okay?You heard voices, you know you did. And was he in distress when you opened the door? Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table? What did you hear? Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room? You'll do it? Father, I have nowhere else to stay. I hope so. He will. He has great faith. If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real? You weren't there. Give me time to get some proof. Father, please don't die. So I guess Satan lost. Satan is the weak one. So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father? That Satan... We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan? So...we won? What do you mean "don't worry?" Father! Thank God you're better! I really need your help. We've only got a few more hours. Father, I'm right here. -- you wouldn't last five minutes. Why are you doing this to me? Oh, thank you, thank you so much! I didn't know what else to do... Peter...Peter Kelson. Well I know he's come here before. Thirteen. The last time, can you believe it? This is how he says "Goodbye?" I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative. My blood type is negative... If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate. Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson. Oh, Peter. Not a lot. Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five. "But this shall you deal with them. You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire." He was trying to tell me something. That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what." He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism. I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything. I'll be all right. Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back. I saw it in his eyes. You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him. Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car. Be right back. Don't go anywhere. What are these? Only your body will remain. I believe your soul will be at peace. If we kill you, Satan can't stay. Until it happens, you're still a human being. Maybe that's my problem. I know it is. Right after my parents died, I went to the beach... I was in the water. Everything was calm. And then one of those really big waves hit me. Hard. Pulled me straight to the bottom. I struggled and finally ran out of air. If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me. I was desperate. I knew you wrote about murders. I needed a way in. You have to say that. I'm scared I'm slipping back. I see things. My worst fears. You need to know something, Peter. I was possessed once. Like Birdson. It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it. Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions. Comfort. There's nothing else here. He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished. Peter, what time were you born? It'll happen at the exact time of your birth. Your 33rd birthday. The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead. Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books. When's your birthday? Peter, let go of the chair! Get up!! Nothing yet. We needed to know all we could. The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out. Townsend, he had some of Father's books. I don't know. I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way. I don't know if it works the same way in this instance. I don't even know when it's going to happen. Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted. Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was. Peter...I'm sorry. Then why are you here? Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive. You father is not who you think he is. Do you know your parents' blood types? Seven years. One baptism? He's your mother's only brother The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford. You were not baptized. At least I don't believe it was Christian. Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie. There's no reason why you should. This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of. Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith... You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world. I know this sounds crazy. I understand. Check your parents' blood types. Are you sure your parents are your birth parents? You're already contaminated. It's why you couldn't hear the tape. There's probably a pentacle near your bed. To sanctify you. The good outwitting the bad. It's like Birdson had a split personality. If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden. Unless you trick him. It's true. Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code. It wasn't easy but I figured it out. It spelled your name. At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man. You are that man, Peter. Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ. So Satan will assume human form. I believe it too. Please, the children. Peter, please... That's their explanation. You might not believe me... I had to. You're right. I must've made a mistake. You're sure? There was nothing? What do you mean? So...what did you think of the tape. Well, I think it's very simple. Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism. I'll be at the Public Library. Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him. On television, you seemed so sure of yourself. If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong? An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed. Disastrously. Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body. I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry. He's pretty amazing. Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed. You realize how rarely they make that ruling? Do you remember Henry Birdson? The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family? In the end, the jury saw it my way. I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson. And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday. And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist. What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist? That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E." And also that... You said that malignant narcissism was not evil. I saw you on television yesterday. You were brilliant. Peter Kelson? Oh my God! Look, John, I'm facing it. You can't back out on me now. We need to be sure. We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then. We need all the help we can get. I've filed a report with Father Frank. I'll explain everything later. Can you meet me tonight? I know who he is. Good seeing you again.Good of you to stop by. It's Detective Smythe. You watch. One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes. I'll have more money than God. Sometimes I can just feel the numbers. I plan to. You want a tip?Would you sign it for me? And what about you? What about Peter Kelson? Where is your moral compass? Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one. Not even God. Are you saying he's legally sane? What do you mean by that? Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts? You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?" It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes. Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case. You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers. I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers? As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you. You had your coaches and your father for that stuff. It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games. That's ridiculous. I don't remember that. Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know. Oh, yes. The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife. So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume? What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you? Child, please. Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say. You're the one always turning your nose up at me. What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up? To go have sex with him? I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot. If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad. Don't curse. You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask? Find out where they're registered and send them a gift. His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me. To that stewardess? How is he? I can manage. Hi. Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game. He's still at the bank. Don't be defensive. I'm just surprised to see you. Monica. What are you doing here? Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that? Nothing. So good luck. Sure. In between all the other things I have to do. Child, take a bite. Taste this. Watch your mouth. That's not funny I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing. Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear? I'm lucky I found it. Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage. Oh, all that work. Monica, what did you do? Okay. The blue. How is she alright looking the way she does? She needs to stop running around like a little boy. Okay. You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold. So you're still breast-feeding? So that means it's alright for you to act like that? ...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour. I just need to lay down. I've been running around all day. When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth? Really? Well, come on, then. Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do. Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about. Oh, me too. I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta. Well, thanks again. This was really nice of you. Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive. You belong on the court. Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on. You're just scared. I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be. I believe in you. You just have to get back on the court. Like you'd get back on a horse. To do what you love. Baby, don't talk like that. Your rehab's going well. You'll be back before you know it. Why not? Four days. Get used to it, babe. What? Yes, we appreciate that. Monica. You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you. Hello. Why are you up? Get in bed. I'm so sorry. No one would switch flights with me.He's fine. The doctor said it was okay. Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat. What'd you do? But you use potato? Are you okay? Yeah, once I cut them off. Why? Too many times. Hey. You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date. If you were tore up I would not be claiming you. Trust. You do. I told him you looked like me. And he's fine, girl. This brother from my college. No. I know... I found you someone. So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet? Just try and chill a little bit, alright. You need to. She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind. Like you don't give her a hard time. Mom's going to hate it. That too tight?What are you talking about? It mattered, Mom. That's all you cared about. I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two. What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers. I do. You never stood up for yourself. Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because of that. I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal. All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table. And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas. And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge. That's not it. I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart. Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not. I wasn't Lena. I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume. No I don't. So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot? There you go. I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy. Whatever. So what do I do? Maybe she is. Yeah, you met her? Engaged. Yeah. Can't wait to see him I just saw Quincy. Need any help? What? Dad around? Didn't know I needed a reason to come home. What? What? You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say. I can't eat before a game. Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron... I won't. I'm a lesbian. nothing. Pants. I hate it. Ah, Mom. Nothing. It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me. I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game. Thanks. Coach... What? I can take it. Wait... Uh-huh. My mouth is kinda dry. Sorry. Huh? Sort of. Oh, sorry. You're cold? They ever love you back? You ever been in love? I don't know how to walk in heels. Yeah, right. Oh, great. How'd you get him to say yes? He's in college? Damn, Lena... Who is he? Mom tell you to do this? Found? I'm not some charity case. Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker. No one's forcing her. Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you... Always on my ass, anyway. No. You shoot like a girl. That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter. Dad. What are you doing here? Chances are there's still a chance. The coach from USC is going to be at the championship. What? I was just showing emotion. The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench. Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me. You ever think about going back? Just not my type, I guess. I wouldn't know. How's that been? Just like that? You mean my championship trophy? My bad. How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian? What's up, Sidra. What's that? I know. Thanks. But? What's up? Didn't have to try very hard. I was just playing ball. Thanks, Sidra. What's up with that? Coach hates me, doesn't she? If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present. So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you. You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to. I know why you broke up with me in college. And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too. So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you. So you're gonna bitch up? Your heart. One game. One-on-one. I'll play you. Better late than never, right? Then why are you so upset? I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago. What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away. It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing. From basketball. You asked me what was missing. We need to talk. It doesn't matter, alright. Just leave it alone. Something was just missing. Why do you keep asking me that? It's a trip, you know? When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way. Wow. Like what? You're serious. And you tore up your knee. Rehab is tough. You had a rough couple years, that's all. It just isn't. That's okay. I'm probably, you know, busy. Strong enough to get you down the aisle? So...how's the knee? Who's this guy I always see her around? You visiting? Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything. Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know? I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile. Actually, I don't... Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine. It was always messing up. Oh yeah? Kiss my ass. Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical. We won the championship. I forgot, "Q-man." I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve. What are the doctors saying? I'm fine. My dad said you tore your ACL. Shouldn't you be lying down, or... No, it looks good. I mean, it's cool. I was. I see your peach fuzz finally grew in. Uh huh. So that's it, just forget about us? When did you decide all this? You're what? You don't think so? How are you going to tell me what I have time for? I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this. What? How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me? If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you. I'm a ballplayer. If anyone knows what that means it should be you. I never asked you to choose. If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting! That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew. What was I supposed to do? What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else? So you fucked around to prove a point! Cheap date. Talk to your new girlfriend. Are you out of your mind? What the hell's going on? Woman... Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer. You weren't at my game. Hey. Fine...Maybe I'll come by later. You want to go talk? Who's nobody? Who was that? he's just playing, Q... Sorry about your game. I've been trying to find you all day. Hey. Quincy... I mean, I can stay a few more minutes. Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up. I...can't. Nothing. Why don't we walk to my dorm? You're not stupid. She understands. I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you. I won. Yo, where's the "D"? Kiss my booty. Give me the ball. What? What are we playing for? That was so weak. I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me. I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me. Quit. I said fine. Fine, Quincy. You do see me standing here, right? Whatever, big head. What'd it say? You finish the reading for E-con? I know, right? It was on my bed when I came in. Can you just...? What? Why? Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied. So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit? Mulholland Drive. Early night for you, isn't it? So you took Shawnee, huh? He ain't Spalding. Yeah. Hey. You either. Yeah. Good. Didn't know you cared so much. Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass. But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady". I'm a ballplayer, okay. A ball player. I'm warning you, don't tempt me. Would you watch the damn road? When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose. I'm not the one who put this scar here. Who said I'm not getting recruited? Who's Spalding? I don't. Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho. But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything. And? She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone." She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail. Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you. Please. Look, big head, I'll be at your car. A ride home. Way to hoop. Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse. You're stupid. And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA. I don't have to do what you say. So? I want to ride my own bike. For how long? Okay. How bout Twinkies? My mom won't ever buy them. I don't like flowers. What do I have to do? I'd just tell my sister, Lena. I don't care. One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth. What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High? I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic. He works at a bank. My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different. I just can. Uh huh. It's this big hole. You could almost see bone. Told you I was nice. I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA. One, up. Give it yourself. There's so many I just can't keep track. No. Hey.You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house. You're a caterer? It was the least we could do. And I love to cook. Okay? ...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then... Happy. And he won't want to see you. He tore his ACL. The doctor'll be back in a minute. Not great. Fine, then how many nights home is that? You said you'd think about going back to get your degree. I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy. If you don't talk to him... I came second to the NBA. I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job. At one in the morning? You just got back from a four game road trip. With who? We should head over. Zeke. Guess I should have been telling your father. Quincy, please... Just...leave it alone. Whose truth are you talking about? Guess he talked to you. I'm fine. You scared me. Later when? Where's your dad? Still the man. How was your game? You hearing me? I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught. They see you, they see dollar signs. Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls. I look like some hoochie to you? I found it on your floor. What is this? Yeah. What?I don't wanna look fast. Thanks, girl. Well, can you give him this for me? C'mon, girl, you live next door. Who's been creeping? Your hair looks so cute like that. Hey, girl.Sometimes. But what's the alternative, not playing? You remember big Toni? She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore. I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here. We just played in the championship game. It doesn't get much sweeter than this. Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women. They can't get enough of me. What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything? So what are these Spanish guys like? It's better. Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money. I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball. Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years. Yeah, four years ago. They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people. I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock. Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed. So they fire me. Can you take that damn thing off the table. I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house. Well, what do you know. Never let a freshman take your spot. Just one word of advice for next season. But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock. No buts. Took a lot of heart to take that charge. Just wanted to say good game. You were trying to make me look bad. That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman. Besides. I've been starting point the last two years. Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot. Hey, don't take it personal. And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other. We're teammates, okay? She hates all freshmen.Whatever gets you off. Should I wear it? That's it? Slam it? Well, what then?Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please. I enjoy it. It's good.Thank you. I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition. I'm not appealing the decision. I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy. Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway. Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her! I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else! Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket. This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful. It's not your fault. See, you have this condition... So why did you come here? You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done? Did Teddy send you? Are you Teddy? Jimmy Grantz. Know him? My boyfriend told me about you. You're the memory guy? You tell me. Well, that's me. What are you here for? Don't just waltz in here dressed like that and order a beer. What do you want? What? Sweet. On the house. You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help. How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff? Why not? Can I ask you something? About your whore of a wife? You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard. Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?! That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot! I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends! What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right? Kill him. I'll pay you. Get rid of Dodd for me. Help me. Don't protect him. What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well - You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you? No! Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it. Calls himself Dodd. Somebody's come. Already. He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something! I told him about your car. This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else. Yeah? He'll kill you, Lenny. And? What are you gonna do? He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me. I did exactly what you told me. I went to Dodd and I said that I didn't have Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything. Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me. Maybe I can help you find him. I know a lot of people. They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy. He went to meet somebody and didn't come back. His name was Jimmy. Just relax. Your wife? Such as? You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure. Kill him. Did you? Yes. I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help. Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me. Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation. Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore. Sleep okay? You know what we have in common? They treating you alright? I wasn't helping you for money. It's isolated. I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals. Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself. Tell me about her again. But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened. Yes. No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear. Is that what your little note says? Yeah. You told me. You did explain, Lenny. You don't remember me.What are you talking about? If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again. Not as much as you feel like hearing it. Lovely. Oh, no, not at all. Maybe just a bit. A change of plans? Sort it all out. I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled. I need time. Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say. Well, that's good, isn't? To win? Yeah. Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou.. 'Thief in the Night?' I suppose I did. Maybe that's it, then. Everything's upside down and backwards... Only because..it's spring..chalk it up - to spring fever. You're not interested in seeing how it looks. And my room? Your room. Ahh.. How do you that. How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me? Well that depends. I left in a bit of a hurry. I'm terribly grateful, Sean. No. You just looked as if you did. I'm infected with Chimera. You know you don't have a choice. Just do it now. Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late. Before I start killing people. I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you? I wasn't thinking! Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all. What? You told me to get out of here. I thought you were here to collect me. I was so relieved. Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here? I am now. Get me out of here. Just get me out of here. Oh Ethan!.. How do you suggest I go about it? Ethan, tell me - Why? What's happened. What did you see? I managed. I'll muddle through. Where do I meet you? -- his left jacket pocket. Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times. What's that about? Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door. - Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me. Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house. Just about.. Just like old times. Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice. Yes? Oh, I do. But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character. How can you possibly? I've got to get right on the plane. I'm leaving now. Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know. Maybe he's lost interest. This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much. Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself.. Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message. Not after the way we broke up. Much. Not me. I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical. And that's the only reason? Someone in possession of all the facts. Are you telling me I have to do this? No. You can be a thief and have a conscience: Not me. Why did you have to tell me about this! What do I have to do to get away from this guy? When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does. And it looks like he's done it again. You know his definition of a true paranoid? But I don't have a conscience. I'm a bloody thief. You've either got it or you don't. Let your conscience be your guide? I'd like a little more conviction.. But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it.. Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.' That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that? There's nearly 2 million in London. What's the population of Seville any idea? That's because I'm on my back. Ask a question, you get an answer!.. Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid? Well, then, what I am I doing here? I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief.. You're not a liar. Or you're an awfully good one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched.. That they're lying. That's not the point. In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't. The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth. He'd lie about his favorite color. But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard. All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies. They've got a book for this? When they've got your recruiting technique? Not a thing. Who wants to be decent?.. Awfully short notice.. Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about? What's you name? Oh bloody hell. You're a spy. Your help? What are you talking about? Listen to what? Where did you get this number? I don't even have it! Hola.. You're apologizing for me? Quite the gentleman.. Sounds smashing. I'm in. Muchacho, mi carro, por favor! Now be serious. You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance.. May I say something, no offence? You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind? If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it? I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace. Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing. Indeed. Do what? - right.. - this is very disconerting.. Where's the bloody - - right..where is it? Would you mind if I'm on top? I see. You're not just another pretty face.. What are you doing here? Uh-huh. Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice. Not tonight. Bad timing. Sorry - No. Just as if I'd like to. No. Should I?Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started. Where you goin'? You came for us.... What? What is it? Gonna lose everybody out here.... Lookit. Lookit! You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there? It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just.... Okay, it was me. What'd I do now? What ? Three full bottles. But almost time to refill. What're they doing? What're we -- I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything.... Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope? Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse? Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it? Leave the sled, let's go, go, go! Bring the light! No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner. Bottle-count. Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last. But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them. I would try for them. But they...they could still be.... Don't do this to me.... I can't....I can't.... No, you see, I promised them...I have to...I have to go and.... You're fuckin' with me. I know you are. Just come with me! I trusted you , Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race. What, you're afraid? I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do.. You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others. Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE! Riddick? How close? You sure you can keep -- We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers. Audrey? How many you see? Get out of our way. What about her? Think about what? Riddick? What the hell are you -- What do you see? Riddick? Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them? We can, can't we? Trust you? But I just wanted to say -- Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually -- Why, what'd you hear? You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now? Entered our minds. I got the quick-and-ugly version. They're coming. Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked. Heard about it. Just never seen it. You did this? To yourself? Show me your eyes. What whispers? Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before.... If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull. What, switch what? Let's move. Just a detour. He'll get us there. We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes. Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light. Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? If you got a receipt? How many bottles? ...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I think two more.... It hurts them. Light actually hurts them.... There.... Christ, you don't know what's out there! Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo. It's starting.... This is it? Booze? That's what you have to drink? We cannot go through there.... Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE! Just shut up, okay? This does not help us, Johns. Are you fucking high again? Just listen to -- I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship. Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking -- Riddick. Riddick . I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype? Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us. We're just burnin' light here. Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can't come up with a better plan. How much? How much you weigh, Johns? For your own fear. Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen. We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock. Stop it, stop it, STOP IT! You coulda helped. And you didn't. Anything else we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when -- You made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team. And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you born lucky? Never said you were a hype, either. You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like -- Dancin' on razor blades here... You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it -- You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over. Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns. You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal. Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I can use him to help with -- He can pilot? Get the fucking cells over here , Johns. What's the discussion? Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to -- ...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings -- 60 years ago. So what happened? Where are they, then? 15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch. Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells. Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts. Thanks for the tip, Johns. What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something? Nobody else is going down but me, okay? Thought you didn't believe his story. We're gonna find the body , Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it. Let's just be sure. So why isn't it all bloody? He used that? Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what.... Like what? No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt -- What? So now you know. During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin. Promise me. Swear to me you won't -- Better keep moving.... No, no, I wanted to get away. Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more. What? Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset. S'matter? I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous? We just keep him locked up forever? And him? Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but... Hey, me. Over here. Hey. Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad. Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler. Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink! Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know. It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to -- Owens! And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! That's how they train you! On a fucking simulator! Company's not here, is it? So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility? Can't get my nose down...too much load back there.... 1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin' took a swipe at us. You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too. He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when -- Oh, no. No, no, no.... And what about the cells? Do what I say. Please. Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them. Imam. Slow down. No, I'm not. But he can. They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them. Riddick? I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off. For now. Frightening thought. You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca? Some prophet guy? So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then.... I don't suppose....Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it. Take it. You were tryin' to kill him too. Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know. Not a star-jumper.So I can move on. You too. What? I've been dreaming about this. I didn't want to leave things the way we did. Not this time. And glow happily ever after. Dysfunctional -- She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area -- No. I didn't. I'm listening. Like now? What did it want? Of what? The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium. What universe are you in, Paul? We flopped the first time out. Why am I doing this? A place you've never been. Could you? What? I'm heading out of town. Day or night?No, the other one. The one who played his wife. There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish. Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie. I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday. Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will. I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott -- Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now? Nope. I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need? Can I help you?I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie. All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut. No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'? It may be Maureen Reynolds -- Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president? Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you. Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you? I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me? He killed Milton! The killer's inside there! Oh God! DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt! Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later? The issue is Maureen Prescott! OK, look. We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'. What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott. Four? There are five. But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it! Please, call me Gale. But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help. Who? Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective? Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around. Alright Kincaid, no where to? I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk. That's Sidney Prescott's mother. A note? So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in? Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI. Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me. Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly. Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is. Sidney, what happened? I work better alone. Why don't you do some snooping around the set? I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later. Has anyone else every used your phone? Do you have her number stored in your memory? Phone memory! Thank you. What? Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door! Fuck! Neither are you, Magnum P.I. I happen to work for the police god dammit! Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to? And who is that? Right. Sorry. Do you think he did it? I'm sorry, this is too good! Someone stole Sid's file? And? Always. All of what Dewey? You do know something, don't you? Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you? It didn't work Dewey. We tried, we're different. It was fucking '60 Minutes II'! I couldn't say no! I could've been the next Diane Sawyer! You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!' But now you're here. Not with me. Dewey, I took care of you. I waited until you were well. I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else. Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.! What about you? Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS. This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again. Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it or not it looks like we're going to have to go back into our past. Show him. Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is. Would you excuse me for a moment? Your life? Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though, tell us, what's your favorite scary movie? It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman. Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies. His two hands, dingus. Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends. Settle down Beavis. Why don't you tell us the truth? Nobody said she was an actor. Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down. Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic. Possibly. No really? Ha. Maybe I should join SNL. And as a sane person. For you that must be quite a stretch. None. I am Gale Weathers! What the hell are you doing? No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look! I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy! Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want? Who's phone? I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen. Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business. AND I DIE NAKED?! UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap? Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3? Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting? Are you saying she was- Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking. I don't think so! Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood? Just because you knew her? And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing? Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom? They're the ones who approved it. Oh come on! Why the hostility? Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to. I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU. Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings. Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker. Let's get out of here! I know! He killed Kincaid! We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth. Who's this. What'd he say? Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what? Hey.Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino? I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member. Oh, Come on! You have made millions off the story of her murder. You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER! Good twist. Bitch. Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do. Basements creep me out. Gale Weathers would find a way. There a story in that building? Need to get in that building? That's funny. You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter. Here's how I see it. I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked. Because someone wants to kill me? No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go. That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you. Make sense? Being Gale Weathers. What the hell are you doing? Geez. God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead! What's your favorite scary movie Gale? Oh shit it's my cell! Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina? I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street. God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me! You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!What? What movie? Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes? Roman that's not the line. I'm hanging up right now. Whatever. Come on, who is this? I think you have the wrong number. This is Candy. Hang on, let me get some clothes. See! I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower! The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello! And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering? Who's this? Page 22.. Ring ring. Hello? Huh, fine. I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked! And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets. What character? I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second. I'm only in two scenes! Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your music video awards. Oh shit. Hello? Director's office. Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight. Make-up. You need it. Hey, Roman isn't here? Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you. What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident. Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.Oh yeah, how? How is that good news? I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family. Till I found out I was wrong. She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets. I don't' know who my mom was. Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it. Hmm. Ghosts are tough, you can't shoot ghosts. What do you mean? Excuse me? Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people. Did you request this case? I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective. You seem to like movies, Detective. What do you know about trilogies? Absolutely. Why didn't you tell me? This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something? He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all. DEWEY! IT'S GALE! Dewey my God I thought you were dead. They've got her! Where are you Dewey? Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?! Yeah? Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers! No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife. These two lethal weapons. Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom. I can see nothing's changed. She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever. Mm, what a waste of Silicone. What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro. Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down. I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about. Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh. Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night. GALE WATCHOUT! I know! Gale he's got Dewey! What are you talking about? Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here? Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?" Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right. Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason! I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye. Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it! Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class? All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard! Alright I'm here, now show your face so we can finish this. I thought you wanted me here? Alright, I'm here. Now what? Yeah? WHERE? Where? You're dead! How do I know their voices are -- Yes. Who is this? If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you! The final act? Well let's play asshole! No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did. You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass! W-what do you want? Who the fuck is this? I'm sorry, your voice. Well then the people you need to call are the police. Are you sure? Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT! Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? Are you listening to me, huh? No I need to call you. Just you. Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE! Laura I think I just killed somebody. Hello?You don't remember? I wouldn't have made it by myself. What? ...So he's dictating you a new bestseller? Whatever that is, it's not our son. Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar! 'HE'? Whom do you mean- We loved each other once. Have you forgotten that? What are you talking about- Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me! Martin, what- Damn it, look at you! Don't you see what's happening with you? We need to get out of here, don't you understand? Out of this house! This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place. Let me guess: Another short circuit? An animal? What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what? Old?! Come look at this! She has wounds. Wounds on her head. Like thrashes. Or bites. Look at this! The dog! She's dead! I haven't the slightest idea. The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here... It's just a feeling. Don't you sense it, too? "Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..." In the village. Look what I found. But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected? I went to see Prof. Roth! You know, I had another one of those dreams last night. I saw Tommi! Why not? She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara. Hey, you're still here. I suppose you like it here with us. Yeah... I have to go to town. Now, what did I do to deserve this? Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other? Honesty - trust! Martin, it's not funny! Someone from the village. If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together. Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before? I miss Tommi so much. I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you. Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times. And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair. Cherry-red Tears. I have a funny feeling. Do you think we'll get over all that's happened? Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it. I just had a really strange experience. What are you doing? Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes. Yes, daddy. My father was a pilot. And do I know how to fly? You? Do you have a better idea? We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning. Do you know where fuse box is? Hey... the fuse. Maybe the antenna's broken. I mean the armchair! What kind of a horrible thing is that? Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone. But don't forget... Me and the muse, of course. How is your book coming along? So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women? Stop that! Oh God, Tommi... You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him! Say it anyway. Come on, how much do you love me? Come on, say it. You know... But what is the truth? Thank you. Elisabeth, I didn't mean to... I really hate to bother him, but... Thank you. Ellen. I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house. I need to know what happened in there. 1976. What happened back then? Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee? Do I look like it that much? Ellen Straub. No, I've never seen him before. Hello. Can I help you? It all went so fast. He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver. I only wanted to defend myself. You have to call the police... I think I've killed him. Martin, my husband, I've killed him! That is, I'm not sure, but... I've killed my husband! And that is? Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!I don't know all about what happened back then. But it always stood between me and my husband. That's alright. Don't misunderstand my husband. It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth? Frank Kosinski. Here's the address. Go see him. Ask him. Oh no, no. You're not bothering him. He has lots of time since he's been retired. Oh, Ellen! I've been wondering when you'd come. Why don't you step in. You're doing fine, aren't you? I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor. Hammer? Peculiar? You mean, like back then? Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it. You didn't tell her! Excuse us. But do stop by for a visit sometime! You are welcome anytime. Just call me Elisabeth.You bet your life. He'll eat potroast and like it. Sure plan to. I'll be there. Then you'll be wet. Nope. Cal... Evening, Cal. Would you tell me about it? I'll knit you a sweater. I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll be waiting. What are you going to do? ...you think that's right... Carla was in the car, right? Maybe they'll be other movies. But that's what happened. You got to tell em that you saw the accident. Don't you? What is it all about? Lookit that, up already. Happen to know where there's one for sale. Not without a rolltop desk. ...the better to eat me with, your dear? ...well, we do that anyway ... Now you're talking... Yes... Oh yeah. Sleep well? People might be better off. They thought about it, spent the evening back in the... What? That's something a man could do...? Best way I know to get ink on your hands. Did as of last week. Press still works. Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper. Show you the plans... ...what...? How's your star? Would you like to see it? I've got the key back at my store... Yep. N'it's for sale. One of the few things money can buy. Yessuh. Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years. No, that's true. I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud. What? Going home. Hi. That's right... Because it's about purity ... ...yes. ...yes. ...he stuck a fishhook in it. I hurt you? How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes. He goes up to her. "What happened to the horse?" She looks at him. She takes his hand... What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling you how to wr... What've you got? What's the scene... Good morning to you ...whatsa matter? Go you Huskies! Time for a change. Keep your margins straight. Sure did. I used to go out with a politician. So is our electoral process. But we still vote. I do if you do. Oh okay . You can do it. No, I just broke up with him. I'll see you tomorrow. Then I'll come back, then. Oh. That's alright. Then I'll come back at a better time. What would be a better time? ...because if you don't, they die... Don't you think you should put them in water? The other side. Read the card. You going to ask me in? It's for your finger. And here's some hydrogen peroxide. I'm gonna be your typist for this evening. You have to sign for it. "Room Service!" Better'n new, cause it's got a story . Want to do the other part? Better idea... Paperclip? Never saw the point of 'em. ...lost the screw... What are you doing down there? "Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice." They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie. Cast stood me up. That's for sure. Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart." Hello. Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice... Me? This is, look: Go you Huskies. ...what I see you saying, is: you have the two elements, Fire and Water . The Firehouse, and the Old Mill ...Do you know, you could... He doesn't go back to the mill , he gets a second chance to go back to the firehouse ... Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see? And you get a second chance! But but but but but it's better without ... The Firehouse ... That's why you didn't want to take the Mill out...you've... Yes ... Well, first, you got to change the title... You bet your life. "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..." It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance. Innit? "You can go back..." You'd know better'n me. I love your script. You're still here. What are you doing? I love your script. Mister White is... ...who...? Yes... Mmm. ...I always thought so... That's what the swing is there for... Surest thing you know. I live there. Everyday things...yes. That whole... So that the Old Mill, the Old Mill represents...the wheel of fate is that too... Goodbye. Well. It was a pleasure meeting you. That's that's that's that's beautiful... Of course. As the Old Mill goes around... I understand... Yes... No, no, I see... Yes... Yes. Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre. You get what you pay for. It was either that, or a sardine. First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642. No, of course, you want to get out of town. No, of course, you don't want to talk about it. N'about ten minutes. What was your movie about? It's about life. Yes. It's in your play. Well. Everybody has reversals. If you were never down how would you know when you were up? Don't be so hard on yourself. Why did you quit? You quit. I beg your pardon? What's it called? You wrote a play on it, what play is that? You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new. Better than new. It has some history. That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement? Who? Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks. We got em. North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal... Yep, you came to the right place. Jessie James was the Brother . Of the novelist, that's right. That's alright Susie. See you tomorrow, Susie. Northern Books. What can I do for you? Everybody makes their own fun. F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment. Local Drama Group. Northern Books. No, it hasn't come in yet. As soon as it does. Yup, you too Marge. I'm sorry. He works on the movie. I'm sorry. It's all over between us. I've found someone else. It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth. I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end. I'm sorry. It isn't you , j... I wasn't doing business. I have to tell you something... I've been thinking. We did...? Hi! "The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed. Although it is altered..." That's so beautiful... What are they offering? Yes, that's right. Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac... What is it, a surprise? Tuesdays and Thursdays. But after Play Practice, I'm yours. After Drama Group. Water or mineral deposits. Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here... S'Okay, Maude. You know your lines...? Morning, darling. What're you doing here...? Yes, Maude, it is. It is a very good play. Maude, this man wrote this play ! We'll work it out...Her... I... ...not if you've got something to hold on to. You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof. I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend. Bourbon and Milk. Sure, what have you got? I don't eat vegetables. The prices are going up. Mr. Bailey. The Mayor's outside. There's other things to be learned. It's night. I wasn't in the car. No. Nobody. Nobody touched me, I was at home. I, uh... Um... I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room. And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...We missed you in Church today, Frank. I'm having dinner with W... It's... I loved it...he... No, I was, I was, I was just learning on, it's a... You have no right to... I really think that business ...matters should be discussed between you t... He's on the Island, he'll be back on... I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss... ...we had a script conference... Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing... I... Oh. Who is that...? But we... I like you, too. I feel so close to you... You know...Where's your bathroom? I love Jewish men. Matzoh! Are you Jewish? I'm not a child ... I have feelings ... Don't you...don't, don't...don't... You can't treat me like this. I'm not a child! No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all. I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't tell you... Bob are you alright...? Hello. I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that. He treated me as if I were a child... ...she has a home ... ...she works with animals , she... The minute I read that script I said... I'm only trying to... I... What? I have a five-o'clock plane to catch. We, we have to give it. Yes. ...yes... Wally... ...and, and, and did she...? And she did the seven shows... ...I... What? ...I can't do it, Wally... I...I... ...they treat me like a child . I, I...to bare my body . Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a... Is...Is the Movie! I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...? Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is... It isn't right . I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con... I can't do it, Walt. "...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go." This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around... half of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..." How many times in your life do you get a speech like that? What, what's there to think about? The scene's perfect...I, I get to say... How can I thank you? How can I repay you for this part? It's a...what a, thank you for this part. The first scene at the Old Mill... Don't let me dis...I'll just... I just...Well, then, what's he doing here? That a fact. Now, is it a good play? I know em, I don't know what order they come in...I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your... A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies... ...the house, the 1835. The original kitchen , of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires... I want them thrown in jail. Don't you touch that...I want them gone. I am so glad to meet you. We are so glad to have you here, and welcome you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, yearly I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835... I've got two days to get this house... Where the hell have you been...? It's... I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the most exclusive ... Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the director ... The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...Give a kiss to Edward. Thanks Miriam. Say hi to Henry and... I don't need them anymore... What's wrong? Baked in a pie. ...a pocketful of rye. Is it cold in here? No. No. I'll be fine. Like a New Year's Day hangover. The first... What? Six or seven times I went in. Remember what happened? Why did we stop? A pocketful of fucking rye. What's wrong? I've got to feed my cat. Besides, I want to get to bed early. Okay. Yes mother. No. Okay, okay... I'd be there for him. I do it all the time! It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created. He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play. Miriam... Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do? She thinks I can bring Edward back. He hates me. Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass. Almost. Mocky-Lock showed up. A pocketful of rye... No. Thank you. Thank you. They're hungry. It doesn't matter... He's mine? I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them... Good for them. I heard Julia and John got married. Absolutely. Abigail... Give her a minute. Hello, Valentine. I can't leave him! Carl, do you know? Like on a map... He brought you to me, didn't he? If you want Julia to live, trust me. Trust him. He wants us to follow. The little boy... Wait... Okay, okay... You're sure of that? Tell me. What happened? What happened to Charles Gish? If you believe that. Then what is he? Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human. Not Stargher, not really. He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster. And an innocent child. If I could reach the boy. He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed. This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore. Not to him. He never finished her. The others...he was able to make them his. You were right. There's a part of him that knows the truth. About what he did, about himself. You thought Stargher wanted to be caught. As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes. He makes Julia real for me. Why'd you bring him here? A kingdom. His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear. A horrible primitive ugly thing. I don't want to talk in here. With Stargher I saw things... Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share. Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people? Agent Novak? The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it. It doesn't have much to do with science. Do you think that's funny? You don't know the procedure. I realize that... Okay. Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead. Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world. I'm sorry, I really am. Really? I don't work with violent cases, I work with children. But even a kid lies. They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true. Don't you think Stargher would do the same? What if he wasn't like this? What if he was "normal?" Conscious. How far would you go? I bet we can fix it. Oh no... No you don't. Who says? What now? He's beautiful......give a kiss to Edward. I'll come by tomorrow after work. With dinner. I know. I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan... Agent Novak. I didn't get a chance to clear him. Damn him. Four and twenty blackbirds... What happened? Catherine? I'm about to start. If you want me to wait, or... She said convincingly. This isn't your responsibility. Remember that. Don't let them use guilt as a tool. If you want to stop, say so. He needs to be turned over. Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia. Nothing. Sing a song of sixpence. That's my girl. Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about. Want to come? Don't bring it home in this. I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time. Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here. Good. We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television. You're sure? Any more nightmares? And he might blame you for terrifying him. That one moment could erase all you've accomplished. And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone. Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened... If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him. Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world. I've heard this argument before. It's not happening. Shush. I don't want to find out. We've been over this a dozen times. No. Someday you can. We all believe that... She adores you. Lucien Baines? "Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am." Did we go sailing? Four-and-twenty blackbirds. Sing a song of sixpence... She's bringing Stargher into hers. What's wrong? I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this. Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry. Intravenous administration complete. Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy. When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers." All they did was observe and report. Nothing more. But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening. She understood. And the patient responded. Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things. He knew she cared. They took care of that, thank you, Henry. Completely unaware. Awaiting his arrival. That's a secret. You're looking well. Agent Novak. Yes. But you're going to sit down right now. I have to... I doubt that. I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest. What about narcotics? Any psychiatric medication? I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs? Nervous? I have done this, you know. Been inside. Yes. That was with Edward. She's accustomed to his world. Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory. She's "lost." Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening. And get her out. Until then, she's at his mercy. Catherine! What about the legalities of this...? When did he lapse into the coma?Two. You can swim? But he has been there, off course. He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach. He tried to borrow money from us. Too far? It's just the sky, Richard. That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them. Richard, you know something - So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim. Incredible. One night I will get the perfect photograph. Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky. I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone. Have you told someone? We swim. Hi. I hope our noise did not keep you awake. Did you sleep well? Bonsoir.Well, I hope it stays that way. Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help? I mean, did you ask her? What kind of drugs has she tried? One thing bothers me... That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him. Serious amounts. He's lucky he lived. So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on? Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession. Easy to make it disappear. For you, poof, it's gone. Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you. Consider it gone away. She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.I want to believe you. I really do. Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar. Nine thousand dollars. He has debts. He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money. It's very hard for me to come and tell you this. He never came home last night. Was he with you? I can't find Manolo. He's right. They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.Where are you going? At least she's alive. My Leica's gone. I don't know. Me, too. Should we bring the police into this? Oh, it is? I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello. No, I don't think so. Leave me alone, give me money. That's what I get from our daughter. She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar. If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole. Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert. You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter. Does this mean you're going to be gone more? She asked me not to. Six months. I found some marijuana, that's all. And a little pipe about two inches long. I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank -- We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences. I think she has to find out for herself, on her own. We have to allow her space -- Why? Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is? Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments. I tried -- Me, too. It's so frustrating. So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise. Superfund is just one of those words. People stop paying attention. Like a Grateful Dead Concert. How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving? You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana. What do you think? I don't know. Not yet. Caroline -- Czar for life, just like a real czar. Honey, your father knows the President.He's a friend. He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation. He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive. We didn't know what else to do. It wasn't my pot. He didn't hang around us. He's like one of those hippie kids. I'm not part of that group. It was a party in all these rooms. His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do? I mean, what would you have done if you had been us? Is this bad for him? Are you going to? Did you tell Dad? Sorry, but I mean, come on. None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar. That makes mom the Czarina. I'm a Czarette. Like Anastasia. Did you meet the President? You can't make me. Like I give a fuck. Fuck you. I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo. How long's the job? Will we get invited to the White House? What if every country legalized at the same time? What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that? I'm a National Merit Finalist. I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club. I'm a Thespian. I'm Vice-President of my class. I'm on the volleyball team. I get A's. All A's. I'm third in my class. Yeah. Cincinnati Country Day. I volunteer. I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours. Yes. Yes. Sixteen I think so. If she didn't she should have. I've only got maybe an hour. Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home. Then here's a little bump. Have you done your homework, honey? Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind -- Are you kidding... I'm staying with you -- Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm. Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you -- What is this, like freebase? What are you doing?It's the same stuff? From the rainy day stash? Did you get it? I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers. I know I made things worse. I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you. Something only you can help me with. That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us. I tried, Arnie. And, I will continue to try. I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar. And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that? Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out. I'm not very adept at being on my own. I've always had a man in my life. Always. Don't you have some good news? Isn't there something positive you could say. What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate -- Please. Tell me who Carl sells to. Arnie, help me. Doesn't anyone owe us money? Arnie, I need money. Somebody threatened my children. They want a first payment of three million dollars. How much do I pay him? If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered... How am I supposed to survive? I'm giving birth in three months. How do I get through this? I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard. I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman. Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass. What is he being charged with? Arnie, this is crazy. Why are you talking like that? Arnie, thank God. Tell me what to do, Carl. I need guidance, not a fucking platitude. I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with. I won't do it. I want our life back. How? Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home? Do you have any idea what is happening out here? Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien. Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging. Nobody will help us. Nobody will take us in. Nobody wants anything to do with us. So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me. Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection. We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents. I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back. How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl. I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something. Just watching you. Hi. Women's room, stall two. Should we stop for ice-cream? David -- Especially Tiger Woods. ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat. All the professionals keep them in the trunk. I'll put this in the back. What are you? A mouse? Get out of the car and do it. This is your chance. There's always a way. If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him. When will you do it? You're kidding. Can't you shoot him or something? I have a job for you and I don't have much time. I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely? You will help me with my other problem. That's crazy. My husband is on trial for smuggling. It should be... It's yours. I want our debt forgiven. I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States. And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed. Fine, then we don't have a deal. I'm six months pregnant. I won't do it. Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine. Odorless. Undetectable by dogs. Undetectable by anyone. Not in... We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine. My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children. Are you aware of this? There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico. I don't think you're going to do that. My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours. Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez? Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son. I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.It's three a.m. I'm not supposed to be here. I snuck out -- What kind of research? Your dad's a doctor. Call him --Yes he is. I'm very proud of him. He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally. They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did. He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends. I am. I'm helping him with the sale. On a bench, across the street. Well, go get it then. Forget why. Do you want it or not? ...I got a present for you. You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room. No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have. Why? That counts. Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it-- It's finished. I won. Think carefully? My turn. When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it? We're supposed to be honest. Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. I didn't know that. Mine's still brown. Rust? He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality. Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today. Yes. He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk. You use your sleeve. Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear. I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait. I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together. My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together. Yes. Is this David? I've come to a decision. Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal. The Mitchell barbecue three years ago. Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning. Is that what you wanted to ask me? It means we're probably to tired to remember. ...I can't remember. Not a specific day. What's this about? Okay. I don't know. It's been a while. Oh. Is Jeremy okay? I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy. What does that mean? For a second there I thought you were a fanatic. Is this a religious thing? And what was that explanation? Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation. Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain. I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game. It's not a thing many people would understand. ...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore. If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together. Twelve years. We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this. It works the quadriceps.That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind. Is David Dunne there? This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God. I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football? Is that right? It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy. No. But once I heard... A ghost? What do you mean? So much. Are you mad at me? I know he does. Yes it is. Can we please not do that? Please? Cause it is. I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing. Besides, Dad would have freaked. Mom, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right. I'm just saying, you're going to be fine. I'll come back all the time. It's only two hours away. Hey.Then we both are. What? Did you? I started seeing things. It got so bad your father almost had to put me away. I miss you. Listen to me. The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother. He loves you very much. He just-- That's not true. No, he wouldn't. Why? That was very good. Of course you will. I know that. Yes? Do you have a scarf? No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it. My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there. Let's deal with that. I'm willing to deal with that. I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist. That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me. Last year. I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this... ...a minor concussion. But the car looked bad. It could have been bad. I think it scared the hell out of Norman. Me? No. Well, in the accident I was injured, but... I felt...pain. That she'd been hurt by someone. This is great. I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my-- No. She said, "You know." That I know. I don't know, I'm very confused right now. Maybe. I don't know. I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive. Like somebody needed me. And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became. Isn't there something called group hysteria? Yes, but... What's happening to me? How? Are you humoring me? You think that'll help? What? What do you think I should do? Um...I'd rather not say...just yet. Pretty. She's a blond. I saw her in the water. Beside me. She was filling the bathtub. She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll. These are good. You're joking. Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and... Why is this so hard? No. Yes. I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace. Because he was worried about me. I didn't want to come. Mine. His. We both...thought... Who's that? Ohhh yes. No, no. Just a little, you know...We're fine. At the party. No. I'm just not sure what you mean. Uh-huh. What can be? I'm sorry? Almost. Just fine. It's a lovely party. I am. Give me that shit. Your wife. Oh-kay... When...when will she be back? Well maybe your wife... Right. Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood. I'm Claire Spencer. From next door. Um... No. No, I don't. Um...sure. What? Of what? What were you so afraid of? Thank you. Would you like some iced tea? And then you weren't there. You do? Wait! Don't go... I'm sorry. It's for the flowers. Why don't you... I know. And I'm sorry. I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school. That's not...It's not like that. Tell me. I can help you. Tell me. Please. What? What are you afraid of? Who? Your husband? Hello? Is everything alright? Um...yes. It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer. From next door. Is everything-- What was her major? Of course. I should be going anyway. You must have been very proud. I don't know. She never mentioned her father. I'm not. We...we met at a party. It's fine. Claire. No, I don't. I'd like to talk to you about Madison. Mrs. Frank? I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night... She's making this up. Do we have to? Stop. Oh God... We were suite mates. He was so pissed. I didn't sleep with him. He looked like one of the Monkees. We know each other. Wow. I don't know... I guess not. Jody he was lying. But he acted like he'd never heard of it. What is it? Like what? That could take days. I need to do something now. Don't you see? She wants us dead. I can't believe this is happening. Jody, she tried to kill him. No. She wanted me to know the truth. Now that I do...I think she's at peace. She could have hurt me if she wanted to. I don't know. How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself? No. All of us. Too late? Jody, it was an accident. Relieved? Why? Adamant? Oh God...you knew. I've got to find a bathroom. I'll call you. Please. No. Jody, listen to me. You have to listen to me. This is not something that I can do right now. Whatever it was, it's gone. I need it to be gone now. Hartford? Did I? Nothing. It wasn't anything. I've been on edge lately. Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just-- Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet. Jody, she's alive. It's alright. I think so Jody, wait. It's initials. F is Feur. It's her. Oh... Nothing's happening. I don't know. The planchette? Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee? Wow. I'm losing it. In the window. Norman's at work. Someone's there. Please. That's all I need. ...no...no...no... Jody, no... What? I don't know. When you say it, it sounds crazy. But what else could it all be? You got it. Absolutely. It's niiice. Oh my god. You bought it. Thanks, but I'm fine. You're discussing me with your psychic? Jody-- What is it? And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club. Okay, I'm a little tender. Why does everyone find that so surprising? Good. I'm good. MADISON! Mauduh... Mmmuh... I don't believe you. Don't I, Norman? YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE. Of a woman you killed! She's out there isn't she? She's in the lake. Fine. I'll do the shopping. You don't have to do that. Nothing. Maybe we can stop there for lunch. Do you know it? Little village down seven. Supposed to be charming. Adamant. Look for antiques... The leaves... I don't know, but I am. She was there and then she was gone. I felt it. She can't be here without me. She's gone. It's alright. Of course she did, Norman. What else could it be? She did it. How did she know where it was? Get out of my way. You should have tried harder. I'm not going to listen to this. Stop... Leave her out of this! Who? ...Oh BULLSHIT. You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family... What did you think I would do? Jesus Christ! I gave up my life and my music... DON'T touch me. Just get away from me. Go! So you fucked a student?! I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened. And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't. Until now. I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house. I was there. "You know..." Your wife... I think she's starting to suspect something. Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor. Since when? What's the matter? Wouldn't go that far. It's Madison Fra-- ...I'm positive this time... I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not... Yes. The ghost. It's her. This is the woman who I've seen. Not personally. What's wrong with me? But I don't remember. But why? I can't understand how I could just completely-- In the living room... I... When she said it, there was something familiar...but no. You told me that I was... I felt you...looking through me... Good. You sat in front...I saw you there... Are you glad? I'm glad. Yep. No, it's fine. I'm fine. Then where is she? Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm losing my mind... I will NOT. No! Not sweetheart, no. I believe in what's happening. I don't want to, but I do. I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you. Norman, this isn't about you. This is something that's happening to me. It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention. Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not... The accident...? Sabotage? What are you...? No. What? Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her. Jody and I. And she was there, Norman, she was. It scared Jody so bad she had to leave. We had a seance. Yes. And he's going to get away with it. He killed her. I'm not crazy. He killed her and-- No! And I don't need a psychiatrist! ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up. I never said I wasn't upset. Of course I'm upset. I miss her terribly. But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something... Norman... I don't need a shrink. Well, that's a relief. We're going to be fine. You're not at the center. Five minutes? What are you doing? Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just... ...Don't get all... Tonight? Oh. When? Dressed? She was lonely, I talked to her. Norman, I know how it looks, but-- Maybe. Point is...not me. I didn't do that. See? Okay. Okay. I'll bet there's...Look at this. Where is she then? It's her! I'm telling you. She whispered and turned on the music. She's trying to contact me! A flare? No. Look! In the window. No, no, no, no. The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay. It's not from here, believe me, I... All right, look at this. He did. She's in the picture. I went over to look and she's gone. The table was set for one. He killed her. Shhhh. Get down! He'll see. Huh. Did you call about the Feurs? Norman, you are so funny about that. No, I didn't. What? No. No. That's just mean. Oh. Jody wanted to know if I could get her some. I'm so sorry. That's... Oh, no... Well, that's nice. Wow. You're kidding. Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer... You are so brilliant. Really? I do, I do. I'm sure I'm just...how was your day? I don't know. Just...whispering. It was there. This angry music all by itself. And I heard whispering. No. Can you drive me home? I'll bring you back in the morning. In the house. I was scared. There were some noises. I didn't want to disturb you. Huh? Absolutely. Take your time. No, no. It's fine. Oh. Hi. Nothing. There was...I thought I saw something. Hurry... Norman, you have to look at this! Promise? I just wish you could have heard her. I know. I'd never be able to live with mysel-- But what if something happens? That's not what I'm sug-- To make sure she's all right. Not like this. We were never like this. I want to go over there. After dinner, we can-- I'm telling you. There was something in her voice... More or less. Of him I think. After that. Tomorrow. Mmm. Shhh. Yup. Nope. I know. We did. To get my life back. To have some time for myself. Some time for us. To tell you the truth...I'm excited. Not the focus. I am, really. Fine. If you have to work... Excellent. Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell. Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms. Three o'clock. Yep. It's Saturday. Don't. Norman Spencer. She's awake. What's their name? I think three...She got it. Turned it down. I'm not. Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks. And I kicked ass. My best stuff. Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried. We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open. You should have heard her play. And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish. I came in from my room... ...just so she could cut them off. Anyway, Claire slept with him... This is...Trust me, Claire. You hear something... change the subject. You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake. You know what happened. The rest is only details. And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those. If you want to put this back together...just let it go. You've got a beautiful life. And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you. I've come to think that's all that really matters. He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too. What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start? Did he say that? I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up... Alight, alright. Stay calm. You opened this door. There's got to be a way that you can close it. We need help. Please let me call the medium. I know. You don't know that. If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out. Somehow you have to break the connection. If she was dangerous before-- What are you going to do? I'm a terrible friend. I got there first. Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman. He seemed desperate not to lose you. He promised to handle it. And we all let it drop away. Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system? By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late. I had just been left by Richard. I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed. Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved. I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone. A blond. I only caught a glimpse. She was young. I should have said something right away. But I didn't. Artsy little village down seven. There's a guy there who sells my work. I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe. I was down in Adamant... Okay. Okay. But Claire-- And he's the real thing. Specializes in cases like this, like yours. Yes. Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford... Something was there. You saw it. Then what was it? What? Does Norman know? I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen. I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire... Are you okay? I have to go. Mef? What's Mef? M-E... Shhh. We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur. What's her first name? This. Place your fingers on the planchette. Sit down here. No, you're not. But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly. I don't... What? Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija. Telling you... Seance. Know what I think? You think he killed her? Listen, I've gotta run. I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning? Beautiful thing, alimony. Lose a husband, get a car. Think it'll help me pick up dudes? Yep. So you'll have some later. Notice anything...different? She's not a psychic. Just a very enlightened spirit. It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness. Sela suggested I bring-- Kambucha mushroom tea... Wow. Got here just in time. I brought you this. Well good. So you're human. Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping... You are? How you holding up?I'm sorry that I frightened you like that. But I was so touched by your concern. I've been lonely here. Perhaps we could be friends. You must think I'm pathetic. I couldn't catch my breath. That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked. I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there... I tried to leave him. Went to my mother's in Boston. He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home. Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe? That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave? Love. You're going to think I'm crazy or something. No. And these roses. They're much prettier up close. Your house is so beautiful. Very much. Right. I'm sorry. For scaring you like I did. When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day... I wanted to apologize. Oh God. He's back. I'm sorry. Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying. Please... This fence...it's so... I've never even met you. How? How can you help me? With your flowers and your perfect life... That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear. I can't, no, no, I can't... And I'm afraid. Oh god, I'm so afraid of... He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath... I'm not... I've seen you. From the window. You're the flower lady. Who are you?Biology. She wanted to be a doctor. Y'hear anything you'll let me know? They're calling me in to work. Full scholarships. Princeton too. She wanted to stay close. It's like that. Doesn't seem real. No note. Nothing. Cops say she'll be back. I just wanna know what happened. Why are you here? Well she wouldn't. He left when she was twelve. Never spoke about him after that. Sounds about right. Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's. Sure didn't get it from me. They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young. Maddie wouldn't hear about it. You look a little old for a student. Just plain old coffee. None of that mocha nonsense. She never mentioned you. What's your name? Please leave me alone. You know where she is? Yeah.The wives. Well, I'm glad. Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know. Toward the end. You remember? There was just...some tension. You were upset. I remember being concerned. For the Dupont Chair. I swear. I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst. Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year. I know how hard it can be sometimes. Wonderful. It's good to see you two doing so well. Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished. How're you holding up? Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity. Of course. You must be so proud.I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes. Tell it to the ones that did this to me. I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey. I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would... Dr. Grey. I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes. This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey. A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him. I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off. You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger. But what you presume to tell this committee - You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to -- Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York. Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants? You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey. Three words: Are mutants dangerous? What is it you intend to do to me? The intention of registration act - Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right. Every word I have spoken will be confirmed. You mutant bastards... You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
