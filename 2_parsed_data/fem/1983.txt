That's a better one. That way. I can feel the cold. Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast. I knew you would come. Yes. All directions are the same here. I don't know how. All the passages are guarded. Colwyn ... Colwyn. Colwyn. I love you, Colwyn. I know it. I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out. Colwyn ... In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening. No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me. Colwyn. About what? I can't. I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now. There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry. I don't trust you to wash behind your ears. Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you. We're almost married. Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down. I have no intention of getting used to it. You might be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses. You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome. Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public. Me too. You don't understand. I'm just so relieved . I was sure you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. He will come for me. He will not! It's a lie! I do not want your worlds or your slaves. I do not want your power. It is hideous.They will have the life that you and I might have had. A match for your son, I think. You knew! You are a rude bumpkin! I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise. Yes. For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise. Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood. It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power. It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen. Freylag's stronghold? What news from our friends?You will not, then? One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me. Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price. Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight. Let me comfort you. You too are lonely. Even by you? Am I not beautiful enough to be loved? Am I not worth returning to? Perhaps you think no man would return to me.There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other. You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out. It will not help. Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here. No. You lie! Why must you know? Of what? Power you have given me. What can my power give you? Yes. Those are reflections. This is my face! Do not try your trickery on me! I killed him when he was born. This place is my punishment. You had left me! I kept silent out of rage. You had a son. She bore you many children? She was not as beautiful. But you would not stay with me. I was beautiful then. It is fifty years since I heard that name. Who speaks that name!Okay... Have them get it out of the tank. Get the hose! We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him! Go on, you're tired. Why don't you take a rest, Brian? I have to walk him till the drug wears off. No, it will be too much distraction. I don't want that many people in the water. I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out. With those camera lights and... I can get it. No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive. Are you okay? You don't have to prove anything. Michael, you don't have to go down there. But you -- Michael, you're not going down there. Who's going to do it? ... I have to go, honey. Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark. How is he? You two go! I'll call Calvin! Somebody better get down there! That's why they're always moving. They have to have it. That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing? This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long! That's just it, Michael. We don't! It was removed from Charlie Overman's body. It's a shark's tooth! Yes, you can. Come on. Michael, take deep breaths. Honey, what is it? I did. He wants it on exhibit. It's too soon to move him. Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow. Michael, I don't have time. Please! It's time you dealt with this and got over it. Now come on! They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic. Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way. You're not going to walk all the way around? Yes. It's faster. No, we'll go through here. I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow. Would you do that for me? I need more pressure in the shark tank. They said you'd be here. It's my new perfume. Great White, the Man-Eater. Mmmm... you smell good. Recovering nicely. Finally. Get some sleep. And tell Sean I'm sorry. Sounds wonderful. ... Me, too. No, you're not. No. It's easier to lure sharks at night. Yes? Thank you. Fine piece of engineering. What's that? I got it on sale. A real steel. I know I can capture it. Yes. Don't think about it. It's over. How the hell did it get in here? Michael... I'm okay. You all right? Get your reserve bottle and let's go. Are you coming...? I talked you into this? Make up your mind. Up. Okay, stay. We'll come back for you. Michael, the sub's dead. That we swim. ... Electrical connection malfunctioning. Nothing. You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving. It's romantic down here. That's a lot of ground to cover. They just wanted to say hello. Hi, baby. Are you scared? Honey... you all right? Just put your mask on. Take a deep breath and hold it. Look, Michael... you don't have to come. We play hide and seek all the time. They find a lot of things. Get out of here! No, you don't need all that starch. You're getting too fat. I can't leave now. We taking Sean out? He doesn't need the money. He inherited a fortune. He kills for kicks. TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins. I don't like what he does. ... Hutton. He really pisses me off. I don't know. I can't understand it. Something's bothering them. Everything's going wrong. I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before. I can't get him to respond. Okay, bye. My imagination isn't that good. That macho pompous English -- See you later. Don't forget you have your brother. I guess. They're acting very strange suddenly. You will. I'll see to it. Till this opens, not our wedding. Well, not much longer to go. Thank you. The net would have to be secured by the intake passage. She, Mister Hutton. The water ski show! We have to get them out! How'd it get in here?! Sharks have to keep moving. They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die. Thanks to you. Brian, he's coming around! Get ready to go. I think that you and I are natural enemies. We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans. By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself. Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade. Now you're helping to nurse it back to life. You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton. Somebody could have gotten hurt. Skillful? I missed my first shot. So do I. But for different reasons. Why are you? Thanks for helping. Should be coming out of it soon. Still sleeping. You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash! I insist you get rid of that bomb. Because I don't trust you, that's why. I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that! We're taking that shark alive! What in hell is that? You look like an orange worm. I want that shark alive. Like hell! I will. The only Great White in captivity, Calvin. All those people standing in line... It's one of the world's greatest creatures. Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it! No! I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one. I think we can capture it. I'd like to try. Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton. Not man-eaters -- I'm sorry. I told you, something's upset them. I can have them walk backwards. Wait a minute. These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton. They're dolphins. It's no use. They won't come into the lagoon. Make this quick! I don't know. They're nervous and skittish right now. They're not tricks. They're behavior patterns. Nobody told me. Go where? Not good enough. I should have never listened to Calvin. I knew it; it's my fault. We moved it too soon. When did this happen? And big for his age. I know. I think they'll come out now.I'm Neo-Senephrened out. Think I'm catching a cold. Hi, Mike. Someone's looking for you. Sure. No problem. Hope with none of my girl friends. Musclehead? 'Preciate it. Give me a ride? SEAN! He's diving! It's okay, Sean. What, hon? Goes up. Told you you'd like it. Isn't this fun! Sean, this is ridiculous. You're acting very immature. You're not in the water. You're in a gondola. Come on, it's fun! Yes, it's great! I know! We can take the gondola ride! Besides that. Sean, do you have herpes? Herpes? Did you see me?! Wasn't I terrific? And alone. Come on! Check this out! How come? Sure am. I'm a water-skier. You gonna work at The Kingdom? Well, wait till you see the rest. You like Florida? How long you staying? 'Course they're also so rich. I was seeing this guy off. He flew in from Dallas. Wants to marry me. He's okay, but Texans are so possessive. So, you just get here? Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit. Can't help it... ahh... Gotta sneeze. Ahhh, ahhh... Watch it, I'm gonna fall. I'm gonna go! Shut up, Tod! Be serious! I don't talk that way. Taking my boyfriend to the airport. Hold still, damn it!We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record. No one's ever done it before. It was a good try... Don't blame yourself. Ten minutes ago. He's a young one. They still seem nervous.You want to show this? I wouldn't mind going down with her. That bugger moves fast.Yes, there is goes. On monitor three. Was a glimpse of something. Did you see that?Oh, many things. Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve. We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge. A new broom with very old bristles. When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism. Did he? I left school and worked for the Labour Party. My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member. I hero-worshipped him. He was 25 years old ... It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war. We thought the country was about to become a true democracy. I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time. They feel betrayed. They want to know what went wrong. Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now � the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act. A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it. The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all. Shall we go? Hello. Anyone for a walk? Tom isn't, I can tell you. These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop. You ought to have that ... The references are to Hansard or to newspapers. I haven't got the actual speeches now. You'll have to chase them up. We'll see you next week, and if-- Don't be silly. I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome. She'll be here next weekend. Why don't you come too, James? I'll show you the marshes properly. If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia. It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today. I do worry about Susan. Have you known her long? She hasn't mentioned you. I think you'll do very well. If you like. But don't be too modest, James. The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books. You are highly qualified. You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job. Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history. A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you. Here I am lecturing you. Have some p�t�. If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost. Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian. In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present. To James. I remember what it was I was going to say. We were talking about forgetfulness. The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting. And I'd like you to call me Ann. Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think? My husband apologises for not joining us. It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield? Good. Suez was a minefield for both parties. I see. Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield? It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation. I didn't want it to be forgotten. And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since. I don't think I'm your man. My first husband worked for the BBC. I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about. I became involved too. I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it. By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on. He's a little unhappy. I hope he wasn't a nuisance? Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden. And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'. Mr. Penfield. I am sorry to have kept you.But what we need is national coverage. It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back? Give them here. This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up. All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country. That doesn't matter. As long as we can get our message through to someone there. Jill, where are those handouts? This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen. Now first of all, tell us your name. Sit on that log, dear.I know. I'm sorry. Oh ... excuse me. There's Nicholas. In your car He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together. Jeremy phoned this morning Yes. Might. Remember, you're here to talk to my mother. I might. No. It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues. Well, you should. Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine? Did she talk about me? I think we're ready now, thank you. And how was Norfolk? Did you get on with my mother? You just might. I bet. Thanks for the drink. I don't trust anyone. That's what comes of working in television. Two or three years ago I would have stayed. And fucked you. I have to be up early. Yes, if you like. Call me at work. Well, you know... I called you a taxi. Damn. They're early. That must be rather nice, in a way. I mean, you don't have any-- It makes me weepy just to remember it. So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials. What about yours. Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters. Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious. I really was upset. I stopped going home. I never phoned. I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier. Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand. So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart. And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters. Yes. You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it. You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness. That's what I think anyway. I think you're exaggerating. And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job. And you're at this third stage My real father? Well, he was a flashback. Good theory. But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does. And the shape of it all. It was sort of...shapeless. And I didn't like that man. I think it went on rather too long. I quite liked it. I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else. No, it's all right. I can get a cab. Night night. Yes, that's right. I'm being terribly rude. Bob? Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett. Bon was at Oxford too. Was that your chapter, then? It was very good. So it's all worked out perfectly... No, he wasn't. He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said... 'Oo I do feel bad. I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!' It's true! I was here last year doing a piece, remember? I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs. They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet. They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television? You're just a young thing.' They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying 'Oo, can I?' It was incredible. He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press. Promise? Oh, yes! Where's mine? I want to look like you. What have you got there? Don't point it at James! Oh no! It was last year. We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools. World history since 1945. Twelve programmes, lots of stock film. You're so famous now. Jeremy! How Fantastic. Actually, I've been once today already. I'll stay here with him. Don't you want to walk, Tom? Tom . .. bed! Go on. I won't. Goodnight.Yes. He wasn't. I can feel it. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hold me. I... I don't know. Shall we try and go around? Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. Hey, are you awake? That's all any of us can see. I gotta get you out of here. Someone who loves you. Oh, no. Quiet. What's he saying? Oh! Ugh! But, why must you confront him? No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. I know. Somehow...I've always known. Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. Your father? Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? Just...images, really. Feelings. Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. Over there! Two more of them!Anyday... I guess he misses a lot of dinners. Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful. Me too. That's why I put this one up. Well, aren't you excited? He really was! The dog's always doing that. And the car's always doing that. Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you. No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it. What would I do when I got there? That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there -- on a Wheat King thresher. Do you think I could do it? Do you? No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that. Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. I can never get a way from it. So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville -- Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since -- I really can't remember when. Pate? What pate? I didn't make any -- Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food. No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff. Peanut butter and jelly. No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it. And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often. I'm talking about salt. Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for. Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise. Some people don't think it's healthy. I mean him. It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father? Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon. I just can't stand this. I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there. That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad? You...um...you never got married? Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up. I even had to pawn my diamond ring then. That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky? No, the problem is -- Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot. Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.? You know what's the problem? There must be a gallon of potato salad left over. And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated. Isn't that terrible? You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this. It really isn't easy. I can't Clark already asked me. Didn't you? He used to love this song. Didn't you? So he just said -- "Would you dance with me?" For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me? And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you. You look wonderful. Clark. Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge? But the bridge... He was asleep before his head hit the pillow. Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you. Well...I guess they did get a little carried away. And this is... ...Clark. My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for... Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky. Thank ...you. Ricky? Where...what...But the other night... It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and... Never. I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that. I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first. Lots of things... Well, don't let me keep you from anything. Don't worry. I'm long past saving. I thought you'd never get here. But how? Where's it getting the power from ???! He can have mine. Anytime. Oh, Superman! In other words, push this red button. Gus? Where's the light switch? I can't see anything. And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks? Hey, I know a lot of things! Diet soda? Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement. Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...There is no handle! You just push a button. It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art. People, I am in love with this machine. Go ahead, Mr. White. Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets. By hand. Like the pioneers did. Mr. White, the next number, please? You've got to pick three more numbers. 53! Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question. Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number. The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.Will you stop interrupting ?! You will command the pumps to stop pumping. You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities. Sister! I'm his sister! I can't! It's out of control! Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin! You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems: Superman. The boy you left behind. Come on, will you? We've got to get ready before he gets here. Where do you usually find a light switch? Turn on the light. "At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace. So I understand from the graffiti I've seen. How would you know? Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped. Why stop at coffee! A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working? If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here! Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...! Yes! This time we got it right! Don't bet on it! Like fish he is. I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame. Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig! Who needs Gus? Come on, let's give it a dry run. Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner? We can get to work on that oil! A normal person. So? Where did it come from? What's wrong? How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs... Don't cry, Bubba. Chicken feed. If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons --- Small potatoes. Today coffee---- Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us. She's not his mama either. Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan. Blizzards! Heat waves! It could make weather! Vulcan is the weather satellite our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather. I don't kiss. That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
