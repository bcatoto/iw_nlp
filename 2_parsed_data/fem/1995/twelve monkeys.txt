I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop. James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West! They may be looking for us, James. Use this. You can fix it in the Men's Room. Airports all look the same. Maybe it's... James! Your moustache! It's slipping. That's what they were up to! Freeing animals! I remember you...like this. I feel I've known you before. I feel I've always known you. Well, you look pretty different, too. In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't. If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police. So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music. So we can appreciate what we have while we have it. Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry. If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers. Shh -- don't talk. Hold still. You... you couldn't have heard me. I couldn't resist. I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys... No superiors! No scientists. No people from the future. It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company. They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned. It's a Carpet Cleaning Company... I...I...We need cash, James. James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number! You tried to call and... Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to. I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon. You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James! How did it get there? What does this mean to you? IT WASN'T A TV SHOW! IT WAS REAL! James, you said he was hiding in the barn... The boy in the well. How did you know that was just a hoax? You disappeared! One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods? Just like that? You were in prison? Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what? We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you. James! That's a policeman. Pretend you don't know me. If he sees you... You're sure? Give me the gun. First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay? It can be dealt with, but only if you want to. I can help you. Nobody is going to wipe out the human race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else. You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face. What made you think that? See -- you can drive after all! What have you done? Did you...kill someone? You have to give yourself up, you know. No. I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you. Shot! Who shot you? What's the matter with your leg? I thought you didn't know how to drive. And he told you then his father was a famous virologist. You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago. Jeffrey Mason? James, why don't we...? You didn't have a gun before, did you? Oh, Jesus, James! You killed him! Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes... Who's keeping an eye on you? I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise. But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is. What do you mean -- when you were a kid? Does that disturb you, James? Thinking about that little boy in the well? What will you do...when you find this...secret army? Clues? What kind of clues? You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever. What are you doing? It wasn't me before, James. It's become me now because of...what's happening. Please untie me. And I was in it? What did I do? We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about? Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child? Something so bad...? "If something really happens"...like what, James? What? You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you. Yes, I remember. Why do you want to go to Philadelphia? I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole. Have you been...following me? Cole! James Cole! You escaped from a locked room six years ago. I have to do this, James. You're very confused. It's just a shot to calm you. I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...? James, where did you grow up? Was it around here? Around Baltimore? Perhaps it was a wrong number... 1995 is the future, James. This is 1989. You think it's July of 1995? That's the future, James. Do you think you're living in the future? What year do you think it is? Do you know what year it is? July. Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James? You're afraid of germs? What's wonderful about the air, James? Hiding? A jail? Prison? You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital? Why not? Most people have some ID. You don't have a driver's license, James? Or a Social Security card? I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers? Do you know why you're here, James. Change what? What kind of information? Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace? I'm going to be completely honest. I'm not going to lie to you. I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you. And I want you to trust me. Can you do that, James? May I call you "James"? Mr. Cole? My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist. I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that? And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen? Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion. And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen. I'm losing my faith. For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die! He was fully sedated! I said it was bad judgment! What else do you want me to say? Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and... I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just... No, thank you. Yes, please. You said he gave a name... That would explain the bruises, I guess. The struggle. You have him in restraints. He's been tested for drugs? What? What did you say? Tight? My watch says 7:30. Nine thirtyTwelve Monkeys, honey. Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning. On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor. Might be tight.
