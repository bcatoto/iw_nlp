Well, I can help. I don't mind waiting. It's a beautiful picture of her. Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian. Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business -- My Jewish friend's grandmother did. I simply can not stand that tone! You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch! Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white! Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny." Well, that's a long time. Boy. It sure has been a long time. Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts. No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died. Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks? I do not need instructions from you to bathe! I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come! Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed. No treasure maps, huh? How bizarre! Eeeww! I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!No. You can have them. Aw, Betty. No. Oh, just a old letter from a friend. Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this? I know. I don't understand it either. I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids? You're right -- that is sick. -- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin! What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage - Did we want to? Was this during Betty? I never knew that. You never dated Kathy Reynolds! I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy. Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk? You mean -- she didn't like sex? Yeah. But I thought she died. Have you called Betty? Maybe you should. And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things? Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay. I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married. At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry. Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy. STOP IT! I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND! Well, I'd like to read them. What are you doing? "... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..." Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose. But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..." No, I don't think so. I -- I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that? Don't say that! My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny. I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away. '82. That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge. That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is. From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is... I love you... Robert. "-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives -- Come here a minute. Michael. I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died. Well, there's a problem. He's not coming. I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry. Mom's orders.No. What a tragedy. What happened? She used to be so friendly. She's changed. I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh. No, what? Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes." What do you know about "the changes"? Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points. Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing. Not this kind of heat. Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all. No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind? I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down. Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me. Madge? Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to. No. Don't do this. I don't know. Please... I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you. Robert. Please. You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you. We are the choices we've made, Robert. No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake. You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change. No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her? His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids... For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life. No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing. What makes it different, Robert? WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT? WHY? You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony! No one's asking you to! Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time? I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything. You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group. I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning - "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death. Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time. Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand. Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food. To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter? Well, what is this? Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam? Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it? Good. More coffee? Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should. Sleep all right? No. Long day. Go to sleep. Where was she? You're right, you know. We don't have much time. Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this. What? What were your parents like? I just wondered. Why were you trouble? What were you like when you were younger? But you don't mind. Why do you say that? I bet you could do a book. On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling. I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by... Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church? And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it! Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them. I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train. Yes. Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here. Take me somewhere. Are you hungry? No. I can't. Not yet. Yes, that'd be nice. Sure. Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour. Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have? Sorry I'm late. Richard called. I want you to come. I understand. That's very kind of you. I think he's running for town crier next year. Oh. I guess you got the whole story. Oh. Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still... Yeah. See you later. No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there. Oh, sure. Great. Wonderful. Uh... The light was fading. Huh-huh. No. I was just... No. Yes! Hi. ... I feel like something's been spoiled now. Listen, I'm sorry I -- I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something. What made you ask such a question? Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world. No, I'm just saying -- But it's not the same. But no one in particular. But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people? Do you ever regret not having a family? Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean. Why doesn't it scare you? You really don't need anyone? Woman friends, too? You must get lonely at times. So what happened? Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced? What? Yes. What? No. I'll do them later. Umm, I don't know. I can look it up. What? No. I'm all right. It's working. When? Smells like dirt. You drink bug repellent? Well, it's kind of buggy out there. My God. How I'd love to see that. No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere. I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it. My children. And Richard didn't like my working. I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school. I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I don't think you're normal. You sound like an artist. Why, do you think? "Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you? You ought to write these stories down. Oh you! Then what happened? Oh my God... You're blushing. What? Okay. Help cook? Would you like to stay for dinner? There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I. But I... We don't even know each other. I feel so embarrassed. I think so. Much. Yes. Very clean. No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father. He's very... clean. Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard. Why? I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens. Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16. About a year and a half. My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer. And how long are you here for? Where are you staying while you're here? I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason. Not at all. Lemon? Francesca. Sure. Oh, that's nice. Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection. No, I'm not. I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just... Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts. No, not at all -- except those are poisonous. Oh there you are. This time of year. I don't mind waiting. Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there? You just... got off the train because it looked pretty? No, really? Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari. No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy. Uh... uh... Umm... long time. Oh. Oh. When did you move back? Are you from Washington originally? Maybe it's because I live here. No. Hmm-mmm. No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait. I just have to get my shoes. Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here. Roseman Bridge? Are you supposed to be in Iowa? I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills. I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me. Yes. And I've accepted. Hmm? Okay. Want anything special for dinner? It's only four days. I'm positive. "I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten." I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too! I can't sleep. I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt. Later. Go back to sleep. Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up. I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache. It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day. Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think. Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us! Well, what's nice about her? Tell us! What's she like? What's her name? Are you seeing Betty tonight? Yes, they are. About an hour ago. Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go? What happened?She changed. My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one. Oh, yes. I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing. See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well. Mrs. Delaney. Did you hear the latest?Oh, that'll be nice. No, of course not. I'll just clean up. You want me to call the doctor? Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am. Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said - "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious? He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.They're not going to find her! I don't remember! I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca! Oh my God...!
