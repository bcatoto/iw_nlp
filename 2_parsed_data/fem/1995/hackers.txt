Oough! Ahhh!  What's going on? What's the matter? Who are you? Hey! Dade! Dade! Dade? What are you doing? Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday. Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet? Up all night again, huh? Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week. Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you? You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade? Right, Dade?! You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you? Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up again and you won't get into college! I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year. I didn't want to sell the house but I had to take this new job, you know that. You're going to love New York, it's the city that never sleeps! Do you have your transfer forms? It's a relatively straightforward question. Do you speak English? I wanted transfer forms. Thank you. Are you coming? The gym is through there, and the cafeteria is through there. Kate. Kate Libby. Here's your class. No, you're not in my class. Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there. Oh my God! He found the pool. Think you can do better? What the hell is going on? If God gave men brains bigger than dogs', they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail parties. Ruth Libby. Her last book sold two million copies. He's not in this class. He's not enrolled in this class. How was school? What did we learn in school today? Aaaah. Did we meet someone special? Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out? Oh don't worry, it's only the rest of your life. And unpack. I mean it! Open the door, Joseph. Bed. Sleep. Now! Sweet dreams, Joey. Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses, and stealing materials for their own ends. These people, they are terrorists. Joey! JOEY!!! How's it going, Ray? In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot. Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation. Why of course, Jennifer. Joey! Just how dangerous are hackers? Well, hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses... Joey! ...and stealing sensitive materials for their own ends. These people, they're terrorists... Joey! Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene. Precisely what you're paid to prevent. Virus? Excuse me? What, it left a note? So what are we supposed to do? What the hell was that all about? What? I don't want to go to jail for this. But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid? Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You... Alright, sir. Get it! Why did I ever trust you? Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose all your toys. Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated? Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc. What the hell are you doing? Plague! PLAGUE! I think we've got something. It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone. However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it. Hey, how do you know my name? Hi, my name is Vickie, and I'm an addict. Hey! What are you guys doing in here? Yeah, it is... I wanna triple the RAM... What is he doing in here? What? You're the moron that's been invading my turf? Murphy kid turn you down? Pervert! What are you talking about? Congratulations. So? What the hell are you doing? It's too much machine for you. I hope you don't screw like you type. P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium. Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything. Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?" Are you challenging me? If I win, you become my slave. You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want. Make it my first born. You're not gonna win. I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on. Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin? Alright, he's in the personal ads. "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking for discreet friend to bring dreams to reality. Leather, lace, and water sports. Transvestites welcome." I... I... I know where you can stick it... I know where you can stick it... Awww, yeah, you wanna lick something? Lick this. Aw, that's disgusting! Aww, Spank your ass... Yes. I'm what? Yeah, whatever. What's the score? And if I win, so do you. Oooohhhh... Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed. You are man enough to stick with the deal, aren't you? You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not grounded anymore. I'm watching you... Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up! Vamano. Time for school, come on. Hello? Phreak? You think they're going to bust us? Hi! Well, now I see what all the fuss is about. Dade... you have company. We need your help. Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc. What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help. Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that? Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in the fridge. Cereal has. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Uh, hold on... Come here, look at this. This thing is dense. The worm eats a few cents from each transaction. Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks. Right, and at this rate it ends its run in... Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it. What? You what? Why did he come to you? Well that's great. There goes MIT. How? Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven. It's my subway defense system. Find it? They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know? You said the worm was untreaceable! Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that! Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn, Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal Killer, Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override, also known as Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias Lord Nikon. We pick them up tomorrow morning at nine o'clock. Yeah, it's Kate. Alright, so what have we got? What oil spills? Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look... "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers! I got an idea. We've got a few hours, right, till we get arrested. So just stay low. I'm gonna go get some help. I'll beep you, okay? Are you coming? There they are! They're elite! Let's get 'em. I lost 'em. Where were you? We need your help.  If you're up to it. A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow. We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program. Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us time, we have to get into Plague's file and copy the worm. Cereal. Go fix the phones. Joey, take his place. Take his place, man, do it. You can do it. Ready? Alright, let's boot up. What is it? What's wrong? "Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe. What's happening? Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me. Cancer? It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast. Colonel who? Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer? Freeze! Ahhh Come on! Kill the Gibson. The tankers have stopped capsizing. Let's get out of here! FREEZE! Shut up and get in the car! We caught 'em. Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them. I suggest you modify your attitude. Because you are floating. And I'm about to flush your ass. Are you crazy? What are you doing? Dade. Thanks for your help. Your son is in big trouble. He has violated his probation and he has engaged in criminal activity. My son happens to be a genius. He understands something happening today that you won't comprehend if you live to be a hundred, and he would never use what he knows to harm a living soul. Oh good. Cause I have a few things to tell them. Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an ongoing investigation. You face possible arrest if you do that. Mister, I don't care if I face certain death. Mrs. Murphy stays right here. Oh, wow, she's great. Well, I'm afraid not. Hackers are a grave threat to the national security. This incident just proves without a doubt that we need increased funding to stop... Oh my God! Son of a BITCH! Plague? Eugene? I don't even know how to work a VCR, let alone a computer! Get off! Look, listen, I'll make a deal. Eugene Belford! I know where his mother is, I promise you. Get offa me! I need a lawyer! Here you are, Mr. Babbage.  Flight time to Tokyo should be about 14 hours today. Can I get you anything else? You're welcome. You would have looked better. I can't believe they decided you won. Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble. Dreams?
