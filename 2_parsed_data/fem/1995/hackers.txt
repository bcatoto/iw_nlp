Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation. In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot. How's it going, Ray? You're welcome. Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them. We caught 'em. However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it. It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone. I think we've got something. Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc. Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?Go fix the phones. Cereal. Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run. I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look... "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers! Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven. Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc. Dreams? Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble. I can't believe they decided you won. You would have looked better. Oh, wow, she's great. Thanks for your help. Dade. Are you crazy? What are you doing? It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast. Alright, let's boot up. Ready? We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program. A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow. They're elite! Let's get 'em. There they are! Alright, so what have we got? It's my subway defense system. How? Well that's great. There goes MIT. Why did he come to you? You what? What? Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it. Right, and at this rate it ends its run in... Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks. The worm eats a few cents from each transaction. Uh, hold on... Okay, thank you. Thank you. Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that? What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help. We need your help. I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on. You're not gonna win. Make it my first born. You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want. If I win, you become my slave. Are you challenging me? Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?" Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything. P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium. It's too much machine for you. What the hell are you doing? You're the moron that's been invading my turf? What? He's not enrolled in this class. He's not in this class. What the hell is going on? Think you can do better? Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there. No, you're not in my class. Here's your class. You think they're going to bust us? Phreak? Hello? Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin? What is he doing in here? Hey! What are you guys doing in here?Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer? Colonel who? Cancer? What's happening? Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me. "Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe. What is it? What's wrong? Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that! You said the worm was untreaceable! They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know? So? Congratulations. Pervert! What are you talking about? Murphy kid turn you down? Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You... But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid? I don't want to go to jail for this. What? What the hell was that all about? So what are we supposed to do? What, it left a note? Excuse me? Virus? Precisely what you're paid to prevent. Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.And unpack. Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late. And would you try and please fill these out? Aaaah. Did we meet someone special? What did we learn in school today? How was school? You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade? Right, Dade?! Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week. Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you? Up all night again, huh? Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet? Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday. What are you doing? Dade?
