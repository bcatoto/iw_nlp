Four. Why? When did you buy it? Monday. There's a deli on Broadway. Nothing that's open. I don't know. You're the one who  said it was bad. Then don't drink it. Yeah, you have to take your fucking  pants off. No, I've been up since four. I've  got a big scene today and I'm kind  of nervous. Have you read the script? Oh. Well, it's pretty emotional. I  tell my mother I never felt she really  loved me. I don't know. I'm just going to go  with how I feel. Which is the scary  part. I'm very close to this  character. Yes. But she died before I, well  before we could reconcile... Thanks. Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever. Ellen... Ellen I have NO  memory of this whatsoever. Good morning, "Mom." Morning. Sleep well? Not a wink. I'm sorry, I thought it was a great  scene, Nick. Whatever it takes, Nick. We're here  for you. Sounds incredible. How long, Wolf? We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it  takes. What do you think, Wolf -- an  hour, 45? Flame on, asshole!! OK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the  work. Lock it up. Going for picture. Ready, Nick? Ready, Nick? And, roll sound. And, roll camera! Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny. Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever. You were just standing there looking  at me. Then you pulled me up and  said, "You're not hurt." Like I was  disgusting for faking, for doing the  only thing I could think of to keep  him from hitting me again. I was worried about Danny. You do remember. He was smaller than you. You were so worried about Danny -- OK, can we get a frame line? Hold it  down. We're going again right away.  Nobody moves. Les, you got the frame  line? OK, here we go. Right away. Picture's  up. Roll sound! Roll camera! Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny. Ellen, I -- Thanks for the apology but you'll  never work in this town again. Here we go, right away. Lock it up.  And roll sound... Roll Camera! Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny. Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever. That's a cut! What the fuck's going on down there!?  You call that a lock-up!? Get that  car out of there! Do I have a lock-up? Is that a real lock-up? OK, right away. Picture's up. Roll  sound. And, roll camera! Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny. Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever. You were just standing there looking  at me. Then you pulled -- Alright, can we please get a  motherfucking frame line please?! Your call, Nick. That's a ten-minute break. Release  the lock-up. Stand by. It's not your fault, Nick. Is there  a way to use some of the earlier  takes? Thanks, Nick. OK. So-so. I saw her in a Michael Bolton video. Where's that flag going? Wolf! No. No more tweaking. Picture's up. Lock it up! And, roll sound. Roll camera! Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny. Ellen, I have no memory -- Oh, God! That's a cut. Anybody hurt? Cora,  are you alright? Props. Props! Let's get a broom up  here right away. Clear the set! I'm going to have a heart attack! Nick! Nick! I'll tell you this much right now; I  am never, ever doing another fucking  low-budget movie. Wolf and I were talking... Ellen's  losing it a little bit. You got three  quarters of the scene really, really  incredible in the first take. Do a  quick cut-away and all you need is a  pickup of the last part of the scene. We're here for you, Nick. Whatever  it takes. Thanks. And, roll sound. And, roll camera! Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny. I... I... OK, could we get the line please?!  Script! Thank you. And, roll sound. And, roll camera! Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway -- I was worried about Danny! I'm sorry, I'm lost... I'm so sorry. I'm fucking this up  for you. Cora, don't even think that. You're  doing great. I'm the one who's fucking  it up. If I get through this I swear  I'm never acting again. Dad hit me first and knocked me down.  It didn't hurt that much but I started  crying anyway, hoping he would leave  me alone. He went over and started  hitting Danny. Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever. You were just standing there looking  at me. Then you pulled me up and said,  "You're not hurt." Like I was  disgusting for faking, for doing the  only thing I could think of to keep  him from hitting me again. I was worried about Danny. You do remember. He was smaller than you. You were so worried about Danny.  What about me, Mom? Why weren't you  worried about me? OK, listen up. Nobody drinks the  milk downstairs. OK? It appears to  be bad. And, roll sound. And, roll camera! I was worried about Danny. You do remember. He was smaller than you. You were so worried about Danny.  What about me, Mom? Why weren't -- What the fuck is that?! Sound? What's going on down there?! Do I  have a lock-up?! Nothing? You don't  hear a beeping sound? The street's quiet. Not mine. Yesterday, when I was helping him  check into his hotel. Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino  in this movie will benefit us all.  If being there when he checks into  his hotel makes him feel better,  then I'm happy to do it. He asked me if I liked jazz, I said  yes, and he suggested we meet tonight  at a jazz club. He did not invite you. Because I feel like it. Oh, stop it. You're acting like a  child. Oh, God. Sweetheart, are you alright? Let me see. Christ, we're going to  be late. Go ahead, I'll take a taxi. Chad; hold it. This was a one-time  deal. You know it, I know it. There  is no need for melodrama. Look, all I ask is that you don't  mention this to anyone. Good. God damn it. Took a taxi. God, I'm sorry, Nick. Something came  up. I forgot to call. I'm sorry, I  feel like such an asshole. I never should have gone out last  night. I hate jazz. God, I look  terrible. Don't bullshit me, Nick. I took a cab. Hold it down, hold it down, people.  Actors working. Why, thank you, Chad. I've always admired you from afar. Well, then: loved. How does that  sound? I've loved you from the moment we  met. We were working together. I didn't  want anything to interfere. Good. Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound. Roll camera! I've always admired you from afar. Well, then: loved. How does that  sound? I've loved you from the moment we  met. We were working together. I didn't  want anything to interfere. Fine, if that's what Chad wants to  do. I understand, Chief. Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound. Roll camera! I've always admired you from afar. Well, then: loved. How does that  sound? I've loved you from the moment we  met. We were working together. I didn't  want anything to interfere. Well, I can turn to look at him. But  won't you be shooting the back of my  head? We're ahead of schedule, Nick. I  think we can afford a few minutes to  set a light for Mr. Palomino. We'll pause to set this light and go  again right away. How long, Wolf? Wolf? It makes perfect sense. I just haven't  found it yet. I'll get it though. We're ready, Nick! Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound. Roll camera! I've always admired you from afar. Well, then: loved. How does that  sound? I've loved you from the moment we  met. We were working together -- I'm sorry,  can we cut, Nick? That's a cut! I know, I'm sorry. But this feels  really awkward; turning all the way  around like this. Nick? Could I just have a moment? Is  that alright? Holding the roll! And roll sound. Roll camera! Hold the roll! We're still ahead of schedule, Nick;  if that means anything to you. OK, everyone stand by. We're pausing  briefly to set one little light,  then we're going again, right away.  Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino. It's going well I think. Don't you  think? Early I hope. I'm going to a jazz  club tonight. Chad? I don't know his sign, but I think  his moon is in Uranus. Oh, Nick! I'm sorry! Is it? Something feels off. Do I? OK, I'll try that. Oh yes, he's very natural. Actually there is. Could you maybe  ask him to brush his teeth? Put your eyepatch on. Is that little light set yet? Get me the A Team in here right away.  Nick, Nicole, and Mr. Palomino. Why didn't you tell me? Oh, I am very worried about the time! What is that supposed to mean? I don't know what it means! I have no idea what you're talking  about! Why are you -- I don't understand you?!! All I do  is take care of you!!! Are you ready, Nick? Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound. Roll camera! I've always admired you from afar. Well, then: loved. How does that  sound? I've loved you from the moment we  met. We were working together. I didn't  want anything to interfere -- God! That's a cut. Hold the work, going  again, right away. I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I  did that. I'm sorry. A momentary delay. Everyone stand  by. We're going again, right away. Oh, OK. I'll bring it up. Actually  could I listen to the take before? Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't  working. I apologize. Chad, I  apologize to you too. I'm completely  unfocused here and I think you're  absolutely right; what we need to do  is loosen the scene up somehow. I was wondering if we could try  improvising the scene. More along  the lines of what Chad has been doing.  Maybe that would help me find  something. Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound. Roll camera! I've always admired you from afar. You're right. How does despised sound? It's sort of like I think you're a  piece of shit. It's not. I really do think you are  a piece of shit. The fuck I do. I can't stand looking  at you! No, I think you have a lot more to  say, Damian. That's not what I meant. You should  tell everyone what you just told  Nick behind the set. Say it anyway: The reason this scene  isn't working is because you and I  slept together last night. Did  everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad  last night! You fucking scumbag! You think I  give a rat's ass about you?! I was  there to get laid and even that was  a joke! Oh, does that mean you're not going  to come wiggle on the bed anymore,  or stroke my hair real soft and  concerned, or kiss me like a soap  opera acting piece of shit! Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come  on! Alright, everyone just stop. Stop!  Stop this right now! Wolf! Oh, God! Don't touch me. Shut up. You're no different than he  is. You lie, you're deceitful... Oh God, now you're doing your own  fucking script. I have no idea! Christ, did you get a bump on your  head, Nicky. 'Cause you're talking  like an idiot. Why didn't you tell me? God, and all this time I thought... Oh, God. Don't go out that door! It's part of the set, goddamnit. Now  go around. Has Ellen showed up yet? Get her into wardrobe right away. No! Scene six; Scene five has been  postponed. I'm not going to say it  again; Mr. Palomino is not working  today. Now where is that smoke  machine! God. Was it something he ate? Stand up, please. Can he work tomorrow? Turn around, please. Hello. Toto, is it? Oh, I'm sorry. What did you say? Come on; that was nothing. I'm the  one who called him "Toto." Jesus,  I'm out of it. I dreamt I was on the  set last night too. Yeah. You were in the dream. Actually, you were. Nick... Not good, Nick. Not bad, but not  good. We need to finish this scene  and do Scene thirty-one today. Nick, Nick. I'll send someone to  your apartment to pick them up. Now,  relax. It's taken care of, Nick. What about the dolly? Oh, I can't make it. I have to go  see Chad; he's extremely ill. Listen, Wolf, this may not be the  best time to say this but our  relationship is going nowhere. Please, don't take it personally.  Because I care for you, Wolf, I really  do. But I've had this feeling for  quite a while and I think it's time  we ended it. OK? I think it's better. Well, good. Still friends? Great, cause we still have to work  together and there's no reason it  has to be unpleasant. Give me a hug. You're a real special guy, Wolf. OK, let's get the A Team in please!  Nick, Ellen, Mr. Tito! I am so hungry. It should be hand-held. Nick, do I see him? OK, here we go. Camera back to One.  Action on the smoke. And roll sound. Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound. Roll camera! I am so hungry. That's a cut. Nick; comments? I thought I didn't see him. Alright, I'm confused. Do I see him  or not? OK, what is the tension? Who is Toto? What did I say? Oh, God. I'm sorry, Tito. I don't  know why I'm doing that. I'm really  sorry. Let's just try it. On it's way, Nick. Lock it up. Going for picture. And  roll sound. Roll camera! I am so hungry. That's a cut. Going again, Nick? Going again, please stand by. No, something's not right. It all  feels fake to me. And, lock it up. Release the lock-up. Everyone stand  by. Any minute, Nick. Going for picture. Lock it up. And  roll sound. Roll camera! I am so hungry. Turn it off! Turn it off! Open the door! Get some water! Clear the set! Ellen! Tito! Please  step off the set! So am I. Then who is that? Who is that? Please  step off the set! Hi, Nicky. Cora Reve, R-E-V-E. Blue housecoat,  blue slippers. How do I know? Because  she's sitting ten feet away from me.  Well sweetheart, that's going to be  a real fucking problem. I took a bus in; went right to your  apartment. Oh, I just went right through the  door. No, it was locked. I just went through  it. It's something I've learned to  do, Nicky. I can walk through just  about anything; like air. I wanted to see you. I've missed  you. They're sending a car. It should be  here in a couple of hours. They didn't  even know she was gone. I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was  going to be a wedding I would have  worn my fucking hat. Is the little fellow going to do  gymnastics? How are you doing? It's dead, Nick. I've got calls out  to every Effects house in the city  but I just can't seem to locate -- But Nick, it's a Dream Sequence. Everyone stand by. Nobody move. Going  again, right away. You tell me! You're the one with the  bug up your ass! You've been picking on me all day! I  can't do anything right! I never said that! I meant me! I feel fake! Everything  I'm doing feels fake. I can't act. I  should just do shower scenes in  Richard Gere movies for the rest of  my life! OK. Ready, Nick?! Picture's up. There will be no smoke  in this scene. No smoke. No smoke in  the Dream Sequence. And roll sound. Roll camera! I am so hungry. Oh, I thought this was the TV room. That's a cut. Going again, right  away. Oh Jesus, you sound just like your  father... OK, OK. I won't move. Nick? I can get right on the phone. We'll  try to get another... small person  here as soon as possible. Give me that apple! I'm ready, Nick! I am so hungry. Going again, Nick? Of course I knew you were filming. Going again, Nick? Alright everyone, listen up. That is  a wrap on Scene Six. What?! Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!!  Thirty seconds of room tone. The  sooner you're quiet the sooner we're  done. What's room tone? And roll sound. Nobody move. I was an actress for a while. Probably. Wolf, I'm sorry! Please forgive me!  I love you, Wolf! Please! Give me  one more chance. Let me prove it! I  love you! I love you, Wolf! What I love about you, Chad, is you're  not afraid of my power. OK, strike the set. Props! Art  Department! Redress for Scene thirty- one. Let's go! Right away people!  Nick! Nick! Anyone seen Nick?!
