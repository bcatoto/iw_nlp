Easy, Rock. Lead on, flyboys. Who's up for lunch? Last one to Ernies buys. Aisha and.I are checking out a new dance spot. I heard that! The Eagle has landed. 'Like Right Now.' Danger from what? Another Saturday night and I'm traipsing around the galaxy with the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother warned me this would happen! Rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel.  Why didn't I listen to her?! Well put a muzzle on him! What... you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you! You're trying to tell me there`re different levels of snot?! He's so cute. Finally, a real man. Now we go out on the town.  First dinner, then dancing, then -- Anybody see anything? Makes two of us. You haven't by any chance seen a ... morphological being lurking around? GroSS! we're not just teenagers, raisin- head. RAT breath!! Somebody needs a shave. PTERODACTYL! SABER TOOTH TIGER! Activating Power Beam! Everybody stay alert. Hey, handsome! My mistake. Rats!  I hate rats! Raptor-Ribbon! Now you see `em. Now you don't. Na na na na na! Fried mice, anyone? What's going on?! ... What's happening to him?' We have to help him! Zordon... you can't leave us. Ever since you came into our lives... you've been like another father `to  us  all.- Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all? How can we reach Phaedos? You garlic-sucking DINGLEBRAIN! The Rangers are going after the Great Power I thought you said this guy was the Master of Disaster? He's nothing but a slime- infested, jelly-bellied blob of -- Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!! This is all your fault!  If you'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would've happened. From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions! It just goes to show, ya never go into business with a booger. Where' s  BILLY? ! BILLY!! You okay? Welcome to beautiful downtown Phaedos. I was just thinking about Zordon...  everything we've been through together. You know, meeting Zordon... teaming up with you guys, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. THEY'RE T00 STRONG?? Wow!  That was amazing for such a little dude! But we have to find him.  Our leader Zordon is dying. How did this happen?! The lady asked you a question. He was attacked by this horrific being -- Ivan Ooze. Ivan Ooze is free?!  We are all in mortal danger! Let' s go. Kind of bossy, isn't she? Is this... food! They're called squirbs. Mine seems to be a little undercooked. Add a few dried weevils and you'll never know the difference. What do you know of the Great Power? Only that we need it to defeat Ivan Ooze. It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible. In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies. For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished. So how can we get to it? The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being... By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja. It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit. You don't understand.  If you do  not have the Ninjetti, the power will destroy  you. To reach the Monolith we must traverse the Neola jungle.  We will train today, and set out on foot tomorrow. Snoggle, you watch your language! Excuse me? He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea. Ah... sure. Ah... thanks. In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one. Now, put your hands inside the flame. Yeah, right. It will not harm you. Just kidding. Wow.  Sand. Now tell me... what do you see? Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold. Stylin'! Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape. Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift. I think its some kind of bird. Kimberly, you are the Crane, agile and sublime. Adam, you are the Frog, quick as lightning. Look closer. Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky. How do you know so much about the Ninjetti? I... am the sole living descendant of the "Nathadians". Now prepare yourselves for the most intense physical and mental training known to man and animal. The crane maintains it's agility through the perfect harmony of mind, body and spirit. Awesome! Let's see you do it . Ghun Phnug Gnouphl. Snoggle, we don't have time for you to show off The ape is strong, but more importantly it is flexible and free. The wolf relies on it's enhanced senses to guide it...  He can hear what we cannot hear, he can smell what we cannot smell. The frog remains still and silent while it assesses its target... then strikes out in the blink of an eye. Girl, you've got to be kidding me. The falcon never struggles with the air, but rather becomes one with it. Each of you must reach deep within and draw upon your natural instincts...  Only then will you know the way of the Ninjetti. Rest for a few hours.  We will continue at daybreak. So where are we supposed to sleep? That guy's cruisin' for a bruisin'. I've never been this sore in my life. I don't believe it! You have been visited by the animal spirits... they have given you their blessing. We belonged to an interstellar Peace Keeping Force known as the "Order of the Meledan". Zordon was widely regarded as the finest Commander in the Galaxy. He was a true Legend... If it wasn't for him, the Universe would be a very different place                  from what it is today. Over time our enemies were defeated...  I returned to Phaedos, Zordon moved on to continue the struggle elsewhere. Until you kids showed up, I hadn't heard from him for centuries. He was always an inspiration... This is why I'm taking you to the Nathadian Monolith.  That is why I'm teaching you the Ninjetti. If Zordon dies... then a piece of all of us dies... and the force of good within the Universe will be dealt an irreparable blow. The Monolith is there in the distance. This is as far as I can take you. You're leaving us?! I have taught you all that I know.   Now you must achieve the Ninjetti on your own. It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it. About twenty seconds in your time. The legend goes that you release the power with the power. That is a question that even I cannot answer. Remember, ten triacs.  After that something bad will happen. Like...how bad? They say the power will throw off a super-heated, radioactive fireball, instantly reducing you to ash and bits of charred bone. That's pretty bad. Ka'Alabas tor nartu En'Kata-Tay. May your animals watch over you. Man, these are the last guys I wanted to see. Whadda we do now? The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.  Nothing can uproot it. Bye, bye birdy. Hasta la Pasta, Bigbird! It's up to you. ALL RIGHT, ROCKY! I guess these guys weren't so lucky. We've come all this way for a rock wall?! Not that kind of power. What NOW! ZORDON!! I am the crane, agile and sublime! I am the bear, stalwart and bold! What HAPPENED?! WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE What does that mean?! It's some kind of mirror! Release the power with the power. WE'RE ON OUR WAY! Yes, Snoggle... they now have the Great Power of the Ninjetti! ALPHA?! What?! ... This can't be... We thought you... What're THOSE?! NINJA CRANE ZORD! NINJA BEAR ZORD! Nice try,  Pinhead! The bear kicks butt! WE GOT HIM!! This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers! ENGAGING KNUCKLE ROCKETS! OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN! 1600 m.p.h.  and increasing! You call yourself a hell-hound?! A basset hound is more like it. If you were a real outlaw you would've gotten me out of this blizzard HOURS ago! It's Ivan and the Megazord!! What about it? -- and KABOOOM -- he's space dust! I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery! Desperate times call for desperate measures. What're you doing?! Taking care of business. Bull's eye! We couldn't have done it better ourselves. LIARS! Do you know what it's like to be stuck in a BLIZZARD FOR TWO
