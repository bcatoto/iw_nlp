We have airlock, Bill.  Proceed. What's the really bad news. Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin. You die, we all die, Bill.  Inject yourself, then diffuse it. Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote. INJECT YOURSELF! Five seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus Christ ... Three, two...  the gas is clear! Next time use the atropine! Every little dream I dream about you, Every little song I sing about you, It drives me crazy when you go away, (notices Goodspeed) Wanna keep you locked up at home ... Hey there. Wrote a new song.  Wanna hear it? Boy, somebody's in a bad mood. Better? What happened baby.  Tell me. You want to talk about it? You know how I feel about what you do. That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape. You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music? Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.

Like hell I'm not... I uhm...  I'm not quite sure what to say. This is all a bit much So  how long have you been out? A while.  And you didn't call?  You are free now, right? Why now?  I mean why today. Well there's not a lot I know about you other than you escaped from San Quentin, had a four day affair with my mother, and I'm the result.  You can imagine I'm pretty confused. Ahh.  Your letters.  They weren't very easy to follow. How about explaining now? How can I answer that?  I don't know if we can.... after 19 years, just start like that. But I don't know you.
