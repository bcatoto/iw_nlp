You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight? I thought I'd stay home and read. I like to laugh, Fred. Wake me up when you get home. A videotape. I don't know... There's no return address  on the envelope... In fact, there's no  address on it. No, nothing. It must be from a real estate agent. Huh?... oh, yeah, it is. What night? Oh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different one. Called?  When? I must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I? I told you you could wake me up if you wanted to. Yeah? Fred?  Fred, where are you? Fred, are you all right? That dog woke me.  I lay there for a while, then decided to get up. Yes, I just found it on the step. I guess so. Yeah. We've got to call the police. ...yes, I've been on hold for ten minutes... I can't... All right, thanks. Hello, yes... Good... My name is Renee Madison... My husband is Fred Madison, the jazz musician... welive at 442 Hollis Street... Right... 442 Hollis... near the observatory... Someone's been in the house... at night... while we were sleeping... I know because they sent,  dropped off a videotape... two  videotapes... to show us... That's  right... Yes... it... the second one...  shows us asleep... Someone broke in and  taped us while we slept!... Isn't that  enough?... Okay, sure... We will... 442  Hollis... Yes, we'll be here. Two detectives are coming out. What is? No. Fred hates them. Yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it. No. No, one of us is always here to let the  maid in.  Nobody else has a key. We will. What the hell is going on?! What was that?!!! On the tape!  There was something else on the tape. There!  Play it! Why would anyone do something like this? I...no. No. No threats. I don't know if I want to stay here.  I don't feel safe. I don't know. maybe a hotel. Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our  house while we're sleeping, filming us,  and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I  thought you set the alarm! But that doesn't solve the problem.  Who is doing this?  And why? I thought you were getting me a drink? Honey, who?... Who's dead? But... It was a long time ago... I met him at  this place called Moke's... We... became  friends... He told me about a job... I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's  okay... Why? what is it?  Why did you make me wait out here? Was there? It's so odd... Waiting out there, I had  the strangest feeling... Like this had  happened before.  I mean, your telling me  to stay outside while you went in like  that. Fred?  Fred, where are you? Howdy, George. I don't know if I can watch this. You talking to me or... her? Did you see that about the guy who  chopped up his wife into a million  pieces? They're gonna cook him. Which would you choose? Do they aim for the head or for the heart? I wouldn't... The brain would know what's  going on.  Your heart would be ripped  open trying to pump blood, blood pouring  into the chest cavity.  Savage pain,  Marian. Absolutely... Soon as your neck snaps,  you black out.  It might take a while for  the body to die, but you wouldn't feel  it. How is this possible, Warden? I saw him before he went to the garage  day before yesterday.  He's a mechanic.  Look, is he okay?  Can we see him? But what is the cause then? ... And how did he get in that cell? I wouldn't know how. When he went to work, right. He didn't come home. I want to see him. Pete... Pete, what happened to you? It's okay.  Take your time, honey. Warden, can we take him home? Are you hungry, honey?  I'll fix you something. Coming up. I'm in the kitchen. Out in back. No... Here he comes. Do you remember? What happened? They found a cyst on my god damn ovary.   Had to cut it out.  You wanna see the  scar? Shut up, bone-head. Keep it in your pants, "V". Hey.  Where have you been? I missed you. Yeah. What happened to your face? What are you guys doin'? You want some company? Why haven't you called me? What's happening to you?  What happened to your face? What do you mean? ... You've been acting strange lately ... Like the other night. Last time I saw you. You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known. You were acting like a different person. I don't know. You still care about me? You really don't remember? It was weird... I don't want to talk about it... No... I really don't want to talk about it. What do you want? I don't know. Why don't you like me? How much? Hi. I'm Alice Wyatt. I was here yesterday. How would you like to take me to dinner? Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner. Where's your phone?  I have to call another taxi. Can you give me the number for United Cab? Thanks. Yes, I need a taxi at Arnie's Auto  Repair, the corner of Fifth and... Why don't we just skip dinner7 Take off my clothes. I want more. Can I call you? Okay, baby. Is that car following us? I don't recognize the car... It's me... I can't see you tonight. I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy. I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you. Pete? I'll call you again. What's the matter? Where'd you come from? I was? I didn't know you cared. Pete... Pete... We saw you that night, Pete. We know that. Meet me at the Starlight Motel on  Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty  minutes. Up here... Come on. I already got the room. He'll kill us. I'm not positive... but... he knows. I don't know. No... no. I don't want to live without you. We have to get away... We have to get some money. I know a guy... He pays girls to party with him... He always has alotta cash... He'd be easy to rob... Then we'd have the  money... and we could get away ... We'd be  together. I used to. No, honey... It was part of the deal. He works for Mr. Eddy. He makes films for Mr. Eddy. Yeah. Pete... Don't... It was a long time ago... I met someone  at this place called Moke's... we became  friends.  He told me about a job... No... A job... I didn't know what.  He  set up an appointment for me to see a  man. I went to this place... They made me wait  forever.  There was some guy guardin' the  door... I started gettin' nervous... In  another room I could see some guy liftin' weights... Both these guys gave me the creeps... They never said anything to me... So I just smoked cigarettes and waited. If you want me to go away, I'll go away. I love you, Pete. So, should I call Andy? That's his name...Andy.  Our ticket out of here. I'll set it up for tomorrow night.   You'll meet me at his place at eleven  o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a  bus ... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's  2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white  stucco job on the south side of the  street... I'll be upstairs with Andy...  The back door will be open... That leads  into the kitchen - go through the kitchen  to the living room - there's a bar  there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy  to fix me a drink... When he does, you  can crack him in the head... Okay? Lemme call him now.  Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night. Andy?... It's me, Alice.  How ya doin?... Andy... I can get away tomorrow night... I could come to your house... That sounds good... Around nine... Yeah, me too, Andy... Great... See ya then. Set. 'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby. Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny. I'm not goin' home tonight ... I'm goin' somewhere else.. To a girlfriend's house. But, we still have a coupla things to take care of... This... and this. Are you my man? Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete? Are you? You've been fucking somebody else haven't you? You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is. What's the BITCH'S name?! YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!! FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!! You are different. I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr.  Dayton... I won't bother you or any  member of your family again. Pete... There's a man on the phone.  He's called a couple of times tonight. He won't give his name. You got him. Wow! Put this in your pocket. You all right? You killed him. It was an accident... Accidents happen every day. We gotta get the stuff and get out of here. That's me. Pete?... Up the stairs - down the hall. Did you want to talk to me? Did you want to ask me "why"? Don't you trust me, Pete?... Stick that in your belt. Look at all this shit... I know a  fence... he'll give us money and get us  passports in exchange for this and the  car... We can go anywhere. Come on, baby. You drive. Come on. We have to go to the desert.  He's at his cabin. We'll have to wait. So we can be together... You still want to be with me, don't you Pete? More than ever? You'll never have me.
