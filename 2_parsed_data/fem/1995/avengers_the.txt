How now brown cow ... The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain ... The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy -- Ready as I'll ever be ... Atmospheric pressure checked, antenna ready...  Thermal chamber ready ... Compression module  set ... Temperature control on course between  one and one forty ... Water turbulence steady ... Good luck ... Peter ... Emma. Thanks, Valentine ... One sunny day ... Readings still normal ... Emma, Peter, get out! It's going to explode! Emma ... Get out! Leave him -- ! Emma! Peter! Don't wait for him -- he's not -- ... The War Office today approved military  expenditure for the nation's new defense alert  system. A spokesman  said he would raise the  matter at the forthcoming World  Council of  Ministers, but that a state of vigilance was  still necessary in the uncertain climate. Steed -- ?! Brenda and I thought we'd drop in. See how you're getting on ... Weather's turning nasty. Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody. I expect you'll like her. Thank you ... 'Please answer the Telephone.' Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John Steed ... Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John Steed ... Kippers ...? Mr. John Steed, please. Impossible? As you see. I have an appointment. Really -- what happened in 1922? Thank you so much. I can find Mr. Steed myself ... And you must be Steed. Please don't get up. I had a spot of bother at the door. 1922. Why the kippers? So what was all this -- some sort of test? Whereas you are. Rules are made to be broken. And just what is the game? Under the circumstances, you may  call me Mrs. Peel. And now that we've settled the matter  of honorifics, will you kindly explain  why you wished me to meet you? Mother? That's better. I much prefer a womb with view, don't you, Mrs. Peel? Shall I be mother? I expect you're wondering where you are. Don't tell me: You're the shadow secret  service. You're so hushhush, even the  legit secret service knows nothing about  it. Am I right? Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it. Now let's see, there's coconut cake,  date and walnut; I recommend the  rum baba ... Hmmm ... Looks like rain, Steed... We're not here to talk about the weather, surely. Oh, yes we are. Macaroon? We've had a series of bizarre weather reports.   We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into  the field for data. Case number one:  April 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins  investigating mysterious fires in corn circles.   A field outside the village of Little Snoring,  one of the hottest days of the year. Trapped  by a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death  in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in  perma-frost. Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M.  Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges,  investigating bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak  rainstorm downed him. Knocked unconscious by a  flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five  inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size  of a cricket pitch ... ... Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief  Major Courtnay. Remains discovered in a turnip  field near Ashby de la Zouche. Our boffins  recorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth,  temperature of 1000 degrees. Spontaneous  combustion. Not much of him left ... My number two. Special assignments.   She's -- Let me guess -- 'Father'? You're -- Have a look at these, Mrs. Peel -- A kipper. Or a red herring? What were  they investigating? How curious ... Something strange is happening. And  whoever knows about it doesn't want  us to find out. I'm no spy -- where do I fit in? Your research into climate engineering was  state-of-the-art. Your experiments could  have revolutionized our knowledge of global  warming -- had they succeeded. We need  your expertise. I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work.   I've been out of action for some time. I'll  consider your proposal. Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area.   One description tallied in all three places.   Recognize her? Me, isn't it? You're saying I have no choice. Father will be your controller. Steed here  will show you the ropes. Ropes? She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill. Possibly. Split personality ... Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right,  you should watch out. She may try to kill you. One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow: she's obsessively devoted to the memory  of her husband the scientist Peter Peel.  You may find her a little ... remote. They were a team. Met at Cambridge.  Working on a top secret research mission  into weather conditions, code name The Prospero Project, when Peel died. Something went wrong. System malfunction.   Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape.   Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File  still open. Her husband was one of ours. Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She  was in a dangerous game, Steed. High  stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If  she is, there's only one solution.  Termination. You. I've no intention of hiding them ... My father always wanted a boy. I had a feeling you would. Touche! Do you? I thought we were on our way. Or half cocked. Steed, we really must be -- You can but I wish you wouldn't ... That place is so absurd, so out of date ... You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk? But why? What's the point? And I suppose you're the knight. That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know. Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first? Do we always follow Mother's instructions? Just what is your position, if you don't  mind my asking.  How did a stuffed  shirt like you get into this line of work? I have no choice. Why should you risk your life? No thanks. An eccentric recluse? June, July ... August? Any other vices? So ... I distract him while you snoop  around? How? Original ... Missus ... Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ? I've come to apply for membership in Brolly -- I so agree. How did you acquire a  taste for it? Have we met? Dear August.  Loves his showers. Like a baby. Scones, Mrs. Peel? Thank you, Lady -- June ... Promised? Who promised? You should be dead.  How do you feel? You were very lucky.  Four shots to  the heart. I found you after I slipped  away from Sir August. Mother brought  you here. Not me you should thank. I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought  you were just overdressed. Mother and Dr. Darling have me  under observation. They think I  tried to kill you. You told them. You said I arrived  on a camel, shot you four times.  Left you for dead. But that's absurd. I may not be  over-fond of you, Steed, but it's  not my style. That's possible. Sir August was convinced  he'd met me before. But I'd never met him.   Another odd thing. When it rained, he said  it was just as someone had promised. No. But he must know. Incidentally,  my double left you with this. Did you say formal? I must dress. You mean my other self ... I should have thought that was obvious ... I'm in mourning. Where's the picnic? Another invitation. 38 Marlborough Terrace ... How on earth can you tell? Very good, Steed ... What's that? Any ideas? Is that written in his shoe? She had this in her mouth. There, there... Major D'Arcy ... ? Well, well. If it isn't me ... Thanks ... I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello? Sir August...? What now? Where's Mother? You don't believe him? But Fares, please, Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's  turning quite nasty. Sir August was  blown to smithereens. Along with  half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's  worried. He tried to warn us ... Too late anyway. Today's escapade  was only for starters. This is no  ordinary weather. It's manmade. A  kind of weather bomb. Not quite. This is my field. The Prospero Project was started by  my husband. It was an early attempt  to solve the problems of global warming.   In theory, climate engineering is entirely  feasible. We thought of injecting a  chemical cocktail into the atmosphere  by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'... Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts  to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea.   Propane gas mostly. In small quantities  it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone  layer. But it proved impractical.  Too bulky ... That's what we were working on. Would it be possible to use it for military purposes? Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible. London. The World Council of Ministers  meets soon on global defence. If you can  control the weather, you control the world. After the cold war ... My car. I'll drive. Three agents killed by bad weather... Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret  defense establishment. A group of  eccentrics obsessed by weather ... Not that I know of.  Explanation? Is that what you think? Have I trespassed on a male prerogative? We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ... Hold on ... Barely. This must be the last straw. Someone didn't want us to get to the party. Aha ... Yes ... It's clear now. A trapezoid shape, dictated by twin diagonal paths and a single curving path. A late Seventeenth Century design, originally for King William of Orange, copied... Ah ... Steed ... ! Quite a collection. Your voice -- it's so familiar ... Peter ... ? I must be dreaming ... Peter ... Impossible ... how? Steed! Diagnosis confirmed.  Mrs. Peel is  suffering from delusions and  hallucinations. An extreme personality  disorder. She imagines her husband  Peter Peel has come back to her ... A classic syndrome, to overcome her  subconscious guilt at her other crimes.   We've attached her to the dreamscape  machine. We'll soon see what her  unconscious looks like... Where am I? Was I? It was Peter -- I saw him ... This man -- did you see him? I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ? Blue ... ... bottle ... Red ... ... head ... White ... Knight ... Black... ... death ... Love... ... death ... Flower ... ... power ... Nature ... ... preserve... Secret ... ... love... Hope... ... love ... Fear ... ... love ... Peter ... ... Piper picked a peck of pickled  peppers how many pecks of pickled  peppers did Peter Peel -- ? How long have I been here? Three days. Do you get paid by the hour? You are here under observation,  Mrs. Peel. You must answer Dr.  Darling's questions I resign. You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign. Watch me. Don't open that, Mrs. Peel! What are you trying to do to me? We want to help...! I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that. The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ... To you ... ? Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations.   He was engaged in top secret research.   Top priority.  Government approved. The Institute ... the funding ... A cover ... for us. I'm sorry... So all that time. Our work, our research  was for you ... for this? And the  accident -- It was no accident. The official investigation ... ... was written by me. It was sabotage, Mrs. Peel. Who? Quite frankly ... it could have been you. Her husband suspected someone very  close to the operation. On the day he  died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his  wife was beyond suspicion. He had to  be certain. He said he was going to  give Mrs. Peel something ... ... I want you to remember. Did Peter give you anything on-that  day? No. He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test. So I'm still ... Under suspicion. Everyone died in  the explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were  the only survivor ... This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going? To find out who killed my husband. The doors and walls are monitored,  Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure  establishment. So am I. She must remain here. She's highly dangerous. Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately -- Mother and Father know best. Something quick. Nothing too ... messy. You followed me. To kill me? A long way down. I could save you the trouble. Because you always obey orders ... Yes ... ? And do you trust me? It wasn't me; you have my word. ... Ready? ... Four ... seven ... ni-... Mmm ... what are you doing? Is that all? So I'm in the clear? But you did suspect me. You're playing games. I thought you played by the rules. I'm playing to win. Please don't tell me it's how you play the game. No, after you. As far as you trust me. When it happens, Steed, you'll be the first to know ... Who could that be? You lied. We are in the final phase. I shall require  you to be especially obedient. There  must be no failures. No idea who. No idea why ... ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children. Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody. I'm a wanted woman, I know ... Why's he called 'Invisible'? Aren't you coming? I see. Peter's brother?  But -- I know all this. Surveillance? By whom? Who's now vanished. Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling  and Valentine were somehow in this  together? But that's absurd. Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now -- Getting to what? I fail to see -- Have we been invited? Well, I can't possibly go like this. You may, Mr. Steed. Inside that hall are some of the Most powerful figures in the world. Tight security. Our only option. It's called Black Leather. What is it? When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit. Shall we? Trubshaw again? What now? 'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception? Have a look at this. Gentlemen, ladies. Forgive the breach  of protocol. An emergency -- Anyone ever tell you you look like a housefly? Anyone else need a lift? This time the shoe's on the other foot. You said a hand-made shoe was as good as a photo-fit or D.N.A.? Well, all we have to do is find the shoe that fits ... Where are you going? You needn't bother. I can't drag you  further into this. After all, I am still  the chief suspect. But -- If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't -- Prince Charming, I presume. Your name is ... Oh my God ... ... and now? Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather. I shall need a small plane. I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed? Tell him I said ... goodbye. Steed for you. Where's Mrs. Peel? You're getting yourself into terrible  trouble, my son. Weather's turning  very nasty -- and so am I. Where? I'm warning you for the last time,  Steed: whoever's behind all this,  looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like  Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel. Steed?? Find Mrs. Peel. This isn't a game. Rules are made to be broken. Then who wins? Decontamination -- ? Emma, my dear. How lovely you look. Would that I could say the Same. Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ... Peter ... It was you ... all the time? You. Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true  genius behind the Prospero Project ... But you died -- in the explosion ... Oh, no. I arranged the explosion. A slight miscalculation -- my face  was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics  came in handy ... Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ... An unholy trinity ... You killed my husband. For starters. Of course I had to kill  the Teddy Bears, as well ... Too many cooks -- Spoil the majority shareholders. In  Wonderland Weather. I planned  everything, even the Ministry  recruiting you ... But I found you. All the clues led me here ... Of course. I planned that, too. But -- why? You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess? For you. It was all for you ... 'Our revels now are ended.' Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ... Think of this as your second wedding feast ... I'm already married ... Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think  of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here. My latest model. A compound of  plastics and sensor chips. A big  improvement on the old X404s. The poor thing is quite fond of me.  Emma, say hello to Emma. You know, I believe she's actually  jealous. Valentine, listen to me ... Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring. Ring? How silly of me -- let me make you comfortable first ... That's better. I say, isn't this  where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ... You're mad. Entirely. On the other hand Mad people get things done. Let me show you -- People expect weather to be free.  They're used to it. I call that a  denial of freedom. No freedom of  choice. An abuse of human rights.  They buy water, electricity, gas.  Why shouldn't they be able to buy  their own weather if they want to?  If they have a little incentive ... Such as? Destruction of their local weather  systems. I can zap a thousand  Chernobyls into the air. The result would be ... Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop  failure.  Economic disaster.   Frostbite or sunburn ... on a  massive scale.  You've seen a few samples... Then what's stopping you? One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring. The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me  as Peter; I tried to steal it from  you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll  be a bit less subtle. With this ring my plan will be complete. How Wagnerian ... Do you mean  to say you've waited all these  years because you couldn't create  a chip on your own? That would  have amused Peter. Speaking of Peter, there's more good  news: You won't even have to change  your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel. What are my choices? Choices? I'll never marry you. One out of two isn't bad. I'll keep you  alive, darling Emma. In a year or five,  you may change your mind. If you're  still in it. This little toy gave me back my face. It can replace yours. What do you think? Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie Thatcher? Ah. That will be Steed. He followed  you. Please excuse me. I have work  to do. My most spectacular  performance. A ballet of clouds. It  was made for you. I want to give you  a heart, Emma. I want all of London  to see it. And now with this ... They will. And for an encore: the biggest cyclone  in history will wipe the City from the  face of the earth. Shape of things to come, my darling. You must let me go ... Don't you understand? If he has me, he'll have no use for you ... he'll destroy you ... No... Start the countdown. Action stations. Five minutes ... To explode. London will be ashes. Are you insane? Stop the program and you activate the auto-destruct! My cloud ballet! My cyclone! Dense cloud formation moving south- west. On course for the center of the  city. A fog floating in from the river.  The prediction is ... unstable chemical  reaction. Enforce the curfew ...  Emergency stand by ... ! My dear. I wouldn't want you to miss the grand finale ... Find her. Kill her ... John Steed. The last one you'll ever see. Did they tell you at Eton that I was fencing champion, too? You're better than I expected. But did they teach you this? You wish. That's not playing by the rules. If you say so. You said ... one shot. I wouldn't do that, if I were you. Bullet-proof waistcoats -- just the  thing. I get mine from Trubshaw's.  We'll be off now, won't we, darling? We wouldn't want to miss the fireworks. Figure it out if you can,  Steed ... Fool ... Aren't you forgetting about something? Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for -- Let go, you ... idiot ... Ugh ... Steed? What kept you? Quick! '... in a beautiful pea green boat...' Still a bit chilly ... Have you any place in mind? I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed. Our little paradise -- just made for two? Pity your mother came, too ... About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ... Next assignment? Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby? Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ... Thank you, Steed.
