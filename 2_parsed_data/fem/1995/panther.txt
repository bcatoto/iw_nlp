No... Fuck that, we've got company... Those ain't cops. I'm okay... listen to me... Let's go with Judge, check it out. Tyrone... Little Bobby... Just a kid... But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either! What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!You believe that? I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God. You meet those friends of yours in jail too? Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison. I saw. I saw that big one hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too. They take you to jail? You don't look alright.You know it. Stay Black... Well don't go forgetting your friends. Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us? Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!! Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now. No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger. Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back. Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know? Ain't no one seen him. It was Sabu killed Cy. Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck... Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum? This cool the heat off you any? Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but... Funny you don't look like church folk to me. You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
