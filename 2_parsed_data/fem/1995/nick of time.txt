You sent my assistant on an errand. But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you? All right, I'll do it. Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies. Nothing. I broke a lamp. Don't remind me. What's he doing here? Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech. Good luck. Of course. I'll get a car to drive you. For not believing you. I would also like to apologize. I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene. Indeed. I love it when pistolero's talk of trust. I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech. I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect? What the hell are you saying? What? Who did? You shot her? How do you know that? You were very nervous. I remember you...in the elevator. Ah. That's...a comfort to hear. One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over. My security people are right next door. Of course. I wish everything were that easy. Yes? You were saying? Your daughter....? What can I do for you Mr....Watson?I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor. I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager. I think you're right. Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me. I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him. We will. He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute. It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances. I don't know. I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked. All right, let's just...let's get security in on this. Yes, you're right, I don't understand. Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant. Is that something precious? It looks real. I don't know anything about guns. He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a He brought a gun onto the pool deck.No, kisses to... No...kisses to you. I promise. All right. To be a hero? Can we go now? I'm tired. I want to.go now. He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out". I can hear you good. Can you hear me? Right. Nods. No way. On TV. Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh. A surprise? Why? I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby. I'm not a baby. Where are we going? Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home. I've done much better ones than this. My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers? Laughs. Everybody does? You stole that.Fuck you! Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here! You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that! Hey! Fuckin' A. I don't have to pay you nothin'. For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here! No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here. I don't want my windshield cleaned. You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not? I've got something for you. Close your eyes. You're a big girl, huh? Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all. That's good. That's good, sweetie pie. You have, huh? That's pretty good. He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero. It goes in that little hole. This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack! Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out. Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that? No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference. What gives? Yeah. Yeah. 'Daddy has to go now. Go ahead, sugar Die. Only you. I kill her anyway. Come with me, honey. Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they? Young love. Where? What about them? Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em. That one.
