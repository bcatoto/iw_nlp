Hey bright eyes, what's the deal  being out here all alone without a  coat? Someone's here. Where? Pig out on all the cake? Oh, there might be one, tiny, skinny  piece left, but you're gonna have to  race me for it. What's that? Ha! You little sneak! In a minute, in a minute... Tough night? No thanks. Shouldn't they be getting to school? Didn't see any. I'm happy here. Just got to give it a chance. Who this time? Huh. It isn't so. No prob. This is "Camposaurus". Camposaurus  was a herbavore, which meant he only  ate plants. Camposaur stayed mostly  to himself and never bothered anyone. This is a leg fragment that belongs  to the killer of the plateau,  Alosaurus. Alosaurus was a vicious  carnivore, which meant he'd eat  anything that moved, especially nice,  juicy Camposaurs. Both these guys lived together right  here on the White Rock plateau eighty  million years ago, when this area  used to be on the banks of a huge,  shallow sea. Remember how we talked  about how sedimentation fossilizes  bones? That's also what made the  hills out behind our town and put  the copper in the ground. Just a tiny bit, Alex. Do you know  why? Uranium, that's the rock they  use in nuclear power plants -- And bombs Alex, yes, is all through  these hills naturally. Millions of  years ago the dinosaurs here ate  plants and drank water which had  uranium in it that became concentrated  in their bones, which is exactly  how, with Mr. Geiger counter here,  we're going to find some. -- Hey. Come on. What's the deal,  Brian? Yes? Sandra? Well, he is. All right, Brian. You get one free  insult. Make it good. Uh... Okay. Everybody satisfied? Cow Demon? I got one! I got one! Easy... Easy... Don't break it. Thank you, Jason. I appreciate it. Well, it's either a 44 million year  old Strychtosaurus or that cow Mr.  Sorenson lost last winter. Go eat your lunch, Jason. Hi. What's your name? You don't look so good, Simon. I'm Mary. Does Miss Henley know you're here? Okay. I have to go. Are you hungry? I could bring  something. Okay. Bye. Brian, have you seen Mary? Allison? We haven't seen her since lunch. We're you guys up in the... Okay everybody, get started on today's  reading. Quietly. I'll be right back. I mean quiet. Mary... Mary... Shit. Mary? Mary, come here. But Simon and I were -- Come here. Go back to class. But -- Go. It's not her I'm worried about. What are you doing here? This is school property, you can't  sleep here. Are you all right? I'll have to call the police. They'll help you. Hi. I hid. I'm very clever. I know. What? Yes. What is it? I don't feel good... What's the matter, pumpkin? Did you  eat something? Did he give you something? Can I go home now? Sure, hon. Let's go. I'll have the school send over a  doctor. ...He's was just laying up there. I  thought, with the kids and  everything... He looked hurt. Hey little brother. Mary... How is she? Same. Did the doctor come by? He found nothing. But something is  in her. I know. Something the  Belagaana doctor can't see. The night  people have been around two days  now. It is a warning. So we have called the hand trembler.  To find if she must have an Enemy  Ghost Way. Here's the last week's watch reports. Bobby just called this in from Chimney  Rock. Can I help you with something? About the guy upstairs? I've kinda got my hands full right  now. Here, make yourself useful. Okay, everbody stays on the courts  today. -- I mean it. All of 'em. Nearly all ghosts now. When the copper  mine closed it took most of the town  with it. We just teach out of this  one corner of the schoolhouse now.  Rest of it's been abandoned for years. Yup. Just me. -- Randy... Do it again and I'll put your head  in the door and slam it. Love and understanding are important  tools in education. I wanted to know what the hell he  was doing there. That it wasn't part of the plan. He  looked hurt. Bloody. Like someone  had cut him. That happens here. Was that... stuff... on the floor  really him? Yes. She's home sick from school today. They're dead. She lives with her  grandmother. I'll have to ask her. The General? Saw him here and there.  It's a small town. About a million years ago. His  interests lately were more like  gardening and herbal tea. Everyone did. He lived here. There are no secrets in small towns,  Mr. Dagget, dark or otherwise. Have a seat. You need a card. Here,  play one of mine. John, this is Mr. Dagget. Says he's  with the police, though judging by  his coat and basic command of the  english language, I don't think it's  from anywhere around here. Long way from home, Tom-from-Los- Angeles. -- What? No way -- Your turn. C'mon, don't be a drip. No, you're not, are you? Let me lead. Mary? The school doctor came by.  Declared it "Non-specific  gastrointestinal disorder". That's up to her. Mary's grandmother called a hand  trembler. Where do you keep the coffee in this  joint? Saturday night in Chimney Rock. When I was younger I used to believe  that no matter how much you mucked  around in your life, one day, if you  listened hard enough, a voice would  tell you what you were really cut  out to do. And when it didn't show  up on schedule I decided to go look  for it. And I looked in a lot of  places, believe me. I drove that  road out there so far that the end  became the beginning again. And it  was when I got here that I realized  there never was going to be a voice.  So I stopped looking and took the  first job they offered me. That make  any sense to you? How did you end up a cop? Are you always this cryptic? First trailer on the highway past  town. I must say, Mr. Dagget, that you  don't seem very like a police officer  to me. I meant it as a compliment. Goodnight, Tom-from-Los-Angeles. Sandra. A little. No. Mary. She isn't here. She's sick. What the hell do you think you're  doing? Get off his knee, Sandra. Everyone  else, go inside. Now. Who are you? I don't know what the hell is going  on, but you both better get out of  here. Right now. Al! Keep an eye on the children for  me. I'll be right back. And call the  sheriff. Just call. You weren't suppose to be here till  noon. I wanted to check on her. How are you feeling, pumpkin? Better. This is Mr. Dagget, Mary. He'd like  to ask you some questions. You don't  have to answer if you don't want to. It's okay. -- Simon. That's funny. "Simon says". I'm good at it. I'm very clever. Simon even said so. He also asked if  I could keep a secret. Something he gave me. What, pumpkin? Then it wouldn't be a secret. It's a secret... ...But sometimes it hurts. Have you ever killed a chinaman? They don't bleed. Not the way you  and I do. Or maybe it was just the  cold... I've killed them, you know. Lots.  You could always tell when they were  coming. There'd be the trumpets first.  Every note flat. Then those songs...  After that they'd charge. Right down  through the snow. The guns would  freeze and it would be just knives...  It was so cold and there were so  many of them. But I was smarter than  they were. Even at Chosin, I was  smarter... It scares me, Miss Henley. I hate  it. Please, make it stop! Make it stop! It's okay... It's okay... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -- It's all right, Miss Henley. We know  you love Mary... What are we going to do? She's going to have the Enemy Ghost  Way. We leave this afternoon. In the home village. The Hand Trembler  must have found corpse sickness... She's already seen a doctor. That son of a bitch... Gabriel the children called him. The  little shit was hanging around my  kids this morning asking about Mary.  He and his buddy make a real pair. I know where he parks his car. Chinamen? Chosin? I've never heard  her talk like that before. Sure, right next to Jack 'N Jill. Nobody I can think of. Maybe one. General Hawthorne. He didn't like children. It was there earlier. What? I'll come along. It's cold... Yeah... Sorry. What is that? Do you feel it? What is it? What... What was that? Hell? How can that be heaven? Jesus Christ.  How? I don't even believe in heaven. You dumb fucking assholes! How could  you have done that! How do you know know so much about  that? They were like us. ...Mary. I don't know what this is. I don't  know what I believe. I don't know if  my sanity is lying back in that cave  flopping around waiting for me. But  I know one thing. Those... Those  things aren't taking her! In those... visions... did you ever  see... God? Me either. Mary? You son of a bitch, why? Why do this? ...You... ...Can't... ...Have Her!! She was coming up the street. Is Gabriel dead? They're not like you and me. You've  got to cut their hearts out. The  only thing God gave them. But your head... Mary's village. Ya-tah-hey. This is a good place. Separate water source. Stocked grain.  Only one possible approach. A man  could, with the proper defenses,  hold off an entire battalion for  weeks. Months. Now we sleep, Katherine. Tomorrow,  after dark, we begin again. Oh Lord, I can't do this. I can't do  this anymore... You're... You're... ...God? I can't. I can't do this tonight. Go  away. Good job. Are you one of them? You're not an angel? What do you care? And if there's a heaven? How? For now. They start again tomorrow. The Enemy Way chant removes the  invading yei ghost. We'll see. How's the head? Here, I'll change the bandage. Does that hurt? Then I must be doing it wrong. I saw the devil tonight. The main one. Satan. Lucifer. The  dark angel. You know. That he did it all for love. That  and I have a choice. Mary's life or  a billion souls waiting in the  pipeline for heavenland to open. No sir. You had to be there. We can double date next time if it's  that important to you. It didn't seem important to him. Are you a priest? Why? This may be your last chance to tell  it. We've never seen God, have we? Not  in any of this. Maybe we're not supposed to. Maybe  that's faith. I have faith in Mary. And that I'm  going to save that little girl from  those creeping things out there.  From all of them. Maybe we both were. Can I help you? There's no visitors allowed in ICU. No, no... Hi, Miss Henley. Hi, pumpkin. Good morning. How's the head? What are we going to do if he comes? When he comes. Mary's ceremony isn't over yet. The  Enemy Ghost Way. The alien spirit  hasn't been driven out. Would you have believed in any of  this three days ago? You have the gun? We could always ask him. It's on the reservation. Isn't your friend hungry? Take 522 to the Sonsela Wash cut- off. First dirt road go left. Twenty,  twenty-five miles you'll see it.  Big, black and all alone. Suits me. He's coming. Go to hell. It's all the same, isn't it? And what do you love, Gabriel? That's all it is for you anymore,  Gabriel, isn't it? Just the killing  and the burning. You don't work for  God anymore. You don't fight for  love. Finish it. Finish it! Go home. And they won't find it. Not in Mary. Can you help him? Are you all right, pumpkin? I'm okay. It's going to be okay... We're all  going to be okay... I can't quite bring myself to say  thank you. Then this is done. No. Are you threatening me? Then you've picked the wrong person  this time. I've just about had it up  to here with ghosts. So you can put  away the horror movie sneer and the  K-Mart halloween eyes, because we  know you now. We know you all. And  if you want to force the issue then  go ahead because you're just another  angel to me. Take a look at your  buddy Gabriel. Then ask yourself, do  you really, really want to fuck with  us? I'm holding my breath. Is he coming back? I don't think so, honey... I don't  think so... You look bad. Not really. I think they might have  even understood. One of them's related  to this clan. He'll give us a ride  back if we want. Do you think it's really over? When I die, I want you with me.
