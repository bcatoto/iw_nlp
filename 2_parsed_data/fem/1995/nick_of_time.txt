Amtrack 2 64, the San Diegan, from  San Diego, Del Mar... ...San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano,  and Irvine is now arriving at Gate  Nine. Amtrack 264 will be departing in  fifteen minutes from Gate Nine for  Oxnard, Ventura... ...Santa Barbara, Lompoc... ...Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo... ...and points north. That one. I hate rollerblades. Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the  platform and gives out an exaggerated  sigh. We made it. Skate-boarders I don't mind, even  though they dress like fuckin' idiots,  but when I see some pin-head on  rollerblades, I get the definite  urge to grease the grill of my car  with 'em. What about them? What the fuck are you looking for? Where? On TV. No way. Young love. Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and  when we need their help in Kuwait,  where the fuck are they? Nods. Right. Perfect. I.D. Could we see some? Where's that? Come with me, honey. You stole that. No, I didn't. I confiscated it.  There's a difference. Let's get your seatbelt on. Always  gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that  right? I want my daddy. There's your daddy. See? We're your  daddy's friends. Hey, would you look at this crazy  car? Everybody has their own radio.  What do you think of that? Everybody does? Yep. And you can listen to it without  anybody else listening. Let's try it  out. This is what they call the jack. Hi,  Jack! Laughs. It goes in that little hole. Let me do it. It's loud! Removes a Pro Label Machine from  under the seat. She begins to type  in several characters. Brilliant. Try us. Don't worry. We'll take good care of  the kid. I kill her anyway. Only you. Where is my daddy going? He's going to help the police. Your  daddy is going to be a hero. My daddy is going to be a hero? Like  Power Rangers? Just like Power Rangers. Reading you. Mama! Go ahead, sugar Die. Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling  Daddy. Come in, Daddy. I can hear you good. Can you hear  me? 'Daddy has to go now. He has to say "over and out". Daddy,  you have to say "over and out". Yes. You didn't miss much. The  food...chicken again. Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same  at all these... They-didn't hear a word I said. The  mike was too low on the podium. How much did we pay for that room? Somebody did. Don't you dare, Franco. This is one  of our biggest supporters. Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial  incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't-  it? I love saying that. Whose idea was it to have a lunch  right after the brunch? I'm about to  bust as it is. We'll just walk through, do a little  grip-and-grin, then get ready for  the press con. What can I do for you Mr....Watson? I think we can accommodate you. Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial  incumbent. You were saying?  Your daughter....? Yes? Of course.  I wish everything were  that easy. I've got the pen if you've got the  paper. How about that? Is that something precious? What's her name? It's funny. I don't even keep a pad  of paper with me anymore, everything's  gone so electronic. If it wasn't for double A batteries  I'd be in big trouble. Are you all right? Elevators make me  queasy, too. That's pretty good. I've done much better ones than this. You have, huh? Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much  more colors at home. That's good. That's good, sweetie pie. Having a rough day? Down at the heels  as they...? You don't see your face, you don't  pay! Having a rough day? Down at the heels  as they say? What you need is a shoe  shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today. Take ten, take a break, take a seat,  take a load off. Put the world in  perspective. So, are you a visitor or lucky enough  to live in The City of Angels? What do you do, if I may be so bold? Don't denigrate yourself, my friend.  Where would the government be without  accountants?  They wouldn't know how  hard they can squeeze us before we  pop, isn't that right? Now you take tips. Time was a tip  was between a man and his customer.  Not any more. They've figured out  what they call a formulae, don't  laugh, it ain't for babies. They  take your sales, see, and slap a  percentile on there, figuring that  somewhere between your lies and your  bad luck they'll hit on the mean  amount, mean meaning "in the middle",  but if you ask me it means "just  plain mean". Why you can have Uncle  Scrooge wring a nickel over your  poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy  Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins  like manna from heaven, don't make  no difference, they'll tax your behind  according to that same figure. Doesn't  seem quite right., does it? It's a load, my friend, but somebody's  got to carry it. What's that? You have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between  that and my wooden leg I'm a mess.  Compliments of the United States  Army Artillery Corps. I'll have you out of here in two  shakes o'f a lamb's tail. Yes, well, you know, for a quality  shoe you can't beat a good wingtip.  Wears like iron. You're a wise man.  There ya' go. Two bucks. You got anything smaller? It's a twenty. Well...thanks muchly... Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you  right out there. Shhh. You'll wake the baby up. What we have here is what they call  a Mexican standoff. The thing you  gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind  the seat?"  Now, a twenty-two'd go  right through it, but even a button  will throw a twenty-two off so there's  a good chance it'd get screwed up  somewhere along the way, miss the  target. Maybe a thirty-eight?  A  thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll  bust up in little bitty pieces.  They'll keep going but they'll be  slowed down quite a bit. How's about  a three-fifty-seven?  It'll go through  the seat, her, you, the dashboard,  shit, it'll go through the engine  block before it knows it's hit  anything, end up in some pedestrian  three blocks away. What do you think?  What's my poison? Well it's a comfort to know you've  got the co-Jones to pull that thing  out. Whether you've got the balls to  pull the trigger we've still got to  see. He's coming back in. Feeling better? The elevator. You weren't feeling  well. Are you better now? Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara  Grant. Yes, you're right, I don't understand. Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me  get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist  you, he's our... I'm listening, I'm listening. My friends, my good friends... All right, let's just...let's get  security in on this. I don't see how they could be in on  it. They're the best. They're hand- picked. I don't know. It's a little hard to trust you under  the circumstances. I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's  one person we can go to. He'll think you're in the crowd until  the end of the speech. Wait a minute. ...I remember that horrible night as  if it were yesterday. A phone call  pulling me out of sleep, the terrible  news... My husband and child senselessly  killed by a drunk driver. We've got about ten minutes. I've heard this speech a lot. Come  on. We'll take care of him.  We will. Trust me. You asked me for help. Let  me help. Trust me. I think you're right. But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy  us, has a curious way of giving us  strength. I doubt if I would be before you  now, if I hadn't been put through  that crucible of loss. And though I can never forget William  and Bill Junior or the love I felt  for them... I have found joy again in serving  this great state. I have found love  again in my second husband Brendan... Is he in? I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her  Campaign Manager. We need to see you, Brendan. I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone  is trying to kill Eleanor. We need people we can "trust. We  only have a few moments... I had to. Her Security people may be  involved... He brought a gun onto the pool deck. He got onto the pool deck with a  gun. How did he get past her Security  carrying a Have it. It looks real. I don't know anything  about guns. Yeah. Daddy...? Daddy, did you hear me scream? She told me to scream as loud as I  could. Did you hear me? Hey, fuck you! You want to baby-sit  a screaming kid in traffic, come out  here and do it yourself. He got the  message, didn't he? Having a rough day? Down at the heels  as they say? What you need is a shoe  shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today. Take ten, take a break, take a seat,  take a load off. Put the world in  perspective. So, are you a visitor or are you  lucky enough to... You got a complaint? I remember. The big tipper. Oh, man... What? The end of the world? Man,  don't give me your mad rap. I'm not  a bartender. I don't want to hear  it. I raise a family doing this  bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your  crazy white ass out of my chair. Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the  right to crap in my ear. You want  change?  You got it, brother. What  was that you gave me, a twenty? Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient  just got multiplied by two. What do  you think of that?  You'll have to  forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your  approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm  deef as a post. Compliments of the  United States Army... ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a  shine, sir? You don't see your face,  you don't pay. Yeah. What gives? Daddy? I'm tired. I want to.go now. Can we go now? To be a hero? All right. I promise. No...kisses to you. No, kisses to... Just about. Two dollars, if it pleases you. Thanks for the tip. Mister, what are you dragging me  into? Cover your mouth. This gorilla's watching you, is that  right? Then don't let him be seeing you  talking to me. I don't want him  twisting my arm off. That was your kid on the walkie- talkie? In twenty-five minutes in the  California Ballroom. What are you supposed to do? I knew I should have packed up and  gone home as soon as I got that  twenty. What am I supposed to do  about this situation? Who? Oh, Jesus ... Then why'd you drag me into it? Yeah, all right, listen... Why don't you tell me about the early  years some other time? Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with  these shoes any more or it's gonna  look funny. You go down get yourself  something to drink. Make sure Godzilla  there, follows you. I haven't the faintest idea. Go on  now. I'll get word to you. Don't think I won't. Quick, off with the shoes and pants.  Trade with Gustino. The big guy's  coming. C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy. Gustino! Drop 'em! And cover up them socks. Man, who  dresses you? Meet Irene. Irene is going to help. You said there was only one person  you knew wasn't in on this thing. You're going to go see her. You sure she's asleep? I took up extra pillows. She take a  nap before her big speech. It'll come to you. See if you can  stop this thing 'fore it gets started.  Save us all considerable  embarrassment. Irene...? Who the hell are you? My security people are right next  door. One loud scream will bring them in  here instantly. You won't get very  far. Think it over. That's...a comfort to hear. Ah. I remember you...in the elevator. You were very nervous. Of course. But suppose we set up an  appointment. I have an important  speech to deliver and you're cutting  into my nap time. How do you know that? You shot her? Who did? What? What the hell are you saying? I said I'd listen to you, not  necessarily believe you. You're  telling me my people are in a plot  against me. You're telling me my  husband wants me killed. What do you  expect? I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as  my last speech. I love it when pistolero's talk of  trust. Indeed. Franco! Franco.' I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream,  Franco. Well? What are you going to do now? What are you going to do!? Where are we going? Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at  all. Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm  thinking of canceling the speech. It's just another speech in a Tower  of Babel so high that Nimrod himself  would be put to shame. Cancel. Make  my apologies. What's he doing here? Hings have changed, Brendan. I thought  you understood that. Don't remind me. Nothing. I broke a lamp. Truth is, besides the headache I've  come down with a little lower  intestinal havoc. Make my apologies. All right, I'll do it. But I want to make some changes. Get  Krista in here right away won't you? You sent my assistant on an errand. Thank you! Thank you all! Are you all right, Franco? It's time....You read me?  I don't  hear from you I'm going ahead now. Why do you keep looking at me? That's my job. I'm your babysitter. I'm not a baby. You're a big girl, huh? I'm not a big girl but I'm not a  baby. Close your eyes. Why? I've got something for you. A surprise? You ask too many questions. You want  the surprise or not? Good afternoon, madam. Hello there,  little girl. Hey, hey, what are you doing!? Just giving you the gift of a clean  windshield. Only cost you a dollar. I don't want my windshield cleaned. You just think you don't want your  windshield cleaned. No, I know I don't want it cleaned.  Get out of here. Don't be like that. Think of me as  the Moses of dirty windshields leading  you through the desert of dead bugs. For the last time, I don't want it  cleaned. Now get the hell out of  here! It's already done. I've already done  it. You have to pay me now. I don't have to pay you nothin'. You're going to deny me a lousy dollar  after I've sweated like a pig giving  you the gift of a clean windsheild? Fuckin' A. I don't think so. Hey! I think this is worth a dollar. Goddamnit! Gimme that! Oh, we'll have to do better than  that. You worthless piece of shit! Gimme  that! Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come  here! Gimme a dollar. Fuck you! Gimme that thing! Goddammit, give it to me, you  Sunnavabitch! There's nothing like a good wing- tip. What time is it? Any comment at this time would be  most premature. Please, we'll have  something for you in a couple of  hours. Please... I...1 would like to...thank you,  Mister Wat... Gene. I would also like to apologize. For not believing you. You have a very brave father, Lynn. He's a hero. Yes, yes he is. Dads are like that. Of course. I'll get a car to drive  you. Good luck. Thanks for the tip. Kisses to you. No, kisses to you! No, kisses to you.
