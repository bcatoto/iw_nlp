Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to  come in his stead.  Shall I leave, M'lord?  You directed me to report to you the  moment the king's conference was  ended.  Scotland. He intends --  He intends to grant --  ...His majesty was quite keen that  you should understand --  No, M'lord.  Yes. I had thought that... I was  loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I  may be excused, M'lord.  ...William? It's William Wallace,  back home! -- Have you met my  daughter?  You've taken over your father's farm? They say he died long ago. Fighting  the English.  The boy's insane!  She absolutely may not, she'll --  Marion!  It's not you. He dislikes that you're  a Wallace. He just says... the  Wallaces don't seem to live for very  long.  Thank you for inviting.  You are. And I'll come again.  Marion, come in!  Marion, come in!  You've been here before?  Did it work?  I... accept your proposal!  Nor I!  You scare me.  This night is too beautiful to have  again.  And I you. You and no other. Forever.  Shush. It's only been a day. And it's seemed like forever.  My parents are growing suspicious! I  can't keep meeting you every night!  ...Tonight!  Let go.  William!  Wallace Wallace! William Wallace!  They say this Wallace killed thirty  men to avenge the death of his woman.  I hope your husband goes to Scotland.  Then you'll be a widow.  I wanted to please you.  You might have lied.  Another ambush! My God! ...What about  our infiltrator?  Yes, you are. And you must wake.  And I with you. But you must wake.  Wake up, William. Wake up!  When the king returns he will bury  them in those new clothes. Scotland  is in chaos. Your husband is secretly  sending an army north.  How do you know this?  Last night I slept with a member of  the War Council.  He shouldn't be telling secrets in  bed.  Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what  a tongue is for.  This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He  fights to avenge a woman?  A magistrate wished to capture him,  and found he had a secret lover, so  he cut the girl's throat to tempt  Wallace to fight -- and fight he  did.  Knowing his passion for his lost  love, they next plotted to take him  by desecrating the graves of his  father and brother and setting an  ambush at the grave of his wife. He  fought his way through the trap and  carried her body to a secret place!  Now that is romance, Oui?  ...I wouldn't know.  I am the Princess of Wales.  I come as the king's servant, and  with his authority.  But now that I am here, will you  speak with a woman?  I understand that you have recently  been given the rank of knight.  Did God make you the sacker of  peaceful cities? The executioner of  the king's nephew, my husband's own  cousin?  That is not possible.  Hamilton, leave us.  Leave us now.  Let us talk plainly. You invade  England. But you cannot complete the  conquest, so far from your shelter  and supply. The King proposes that  you withdraw your attack. In return  he grants you title, estates, and  this chest with a thousand pounds of  gold, which I am to pay to you  personally.  Peace is made is such ways.  I understand you have suffered. I  know... about your woman.  Sir. I leave this money, as a gift.  Not from the king, but from myself.  And not to you, but to the orphans  of your country.  No. He did not.  He waits. For you. He says he will  attack no more towns -- if you are  man enough to come fight him.  ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king  like you, M'lord.  Humbly, M'lord.  No. I have it to ease the suffering  of the children of this war.  Forgive me, Sire. I thought that  generosity might demonstrate your  greatness to those you mean to rule.  Good day to you, M'Lords.  I am cheerful with a plan to soothe  your miseries. All of England shudders  with the news of renewed rebellion.  Wallace himself. If you wish to  pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers  in every Scottish town, I leave you  to your hauntings. If you wish to  take him, I know a way.  I have faced him. Have you?  He will fight you forever. But what  does he fight for? Freedom first,  and peace. So grant them.  Grant, as you do everything else,  with treachery. Offer him a truce to  discuss terms, and send me to my  castle at Locharmbie as your emissary.  He trusts me. Pick thirty of your  finest assassins for me to take along.  And I will set the meeting, and the  ambush.  And you have reached Wallace's men?  It does me good to see you.  There will be a new shipment of  supplies coming north next month.  Food and weapons. They will trav --  Then why did you come?  Because of the way you're looking at  me now. The same way... as when we  met.  I know. You looked at me... and saw  her.  You must forgive me what I feel. No  man has ever looked at me as you  did.  I have taken vows. More than one.  I've vowed faithfulness to my husband,  and sworn to give him a son. And I  cannot keep both promises.  You understand. Consider, before you  laugh and say no. You will never own  a throne, though you deserve one.  But just as the sun will rise  tomorrow, some man will rule England.  And what if his veins ran not with  the blood of Longshanks, but with  that of a true king?  No. But can you love me for the sake  of all you loved and lost? Or simply  love me... because I love you?  No one! Hurry!  When we... did you think of her?  Is it true? Wallace is captured?  When will his trial be?  I will see the prisoner.  The king will be dead in a month!  And his son is a weakling! Who do  you think will rule this kingdom?  Now OPEN THIS DOOR!  Stop! Leave me! There is no way out of this hell!  Leave me with him!  Sir, I... come to beg you to confess  all, and swear allegiance to the  king, that he might show you mercy.  Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps  even live in the Tower. In time, who  knows what can happen, if you can  only live.  You will die! It will be awful!  Drink this! It will dull your pain.  I can't bear the thought of your  torture. Take it!  I have come to beg for the life of  William Wallace.  I respect him. At worst he was a  worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou  great king... and win the respect of  your own people.  Even now, you are incapable of mercy?  Nor you. To you that word is as  unfamiliar as love.  You see? Death comes to us all. And  it comes to William Wallace. But  before death comes to you, know this:  your blood dies with you. A child  who is not of your line grows in my  belly. Your son will not sit long on  the throne. I swear it.
