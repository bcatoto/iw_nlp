On air in 30 seconds. (very angry) Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla. Tokemata tokemata!  Seno santonoi-aypa! Minoi ay Cheba!  Givomana seno! (angrily) Teno akta chataman assin-omekta! Akina delutan, nou-shan. (irresistible) Please... HELP... Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan! (weak) ...Priest... (weak) Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest... (angry) Eto Akta Gamat! (after a moment) Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat. ...Leeloo. Corn-i-Lius? (pronouncing badly) Napoleon... small. San Agamat chay bet... envolet! (to David) Domo danko! Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat! Dot! You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City! I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes. You wouldn't even eat one to help your poor mother, and you win the big prize? Know something? The whole thing makes me sick! Are you listening to me, you ingrate! ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!! I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it? You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two! They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead! Apipoulai! (nicely) Valo massa... Chacha hamas. (licking) Cornelius.. Achta ge lumitai de matala.. (displeased) Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas! Have you pulled yourself together? Akta dedero ansila do mektet. (sharply) Dinoine chagantakat! You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the coolest DJ in the universe. Forget anonymous.  You'll be doing Loc Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7! Apipoulai! Love... (rather pleased) Peace... and love... (quite happy) What is... Make Love? (switching off the screen) OK! Finished! Learning language. All 900. (pleased) Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine! Apipoussan! Good! Do you know how we say "make love"? ...Hoppi-hoppa. Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas! Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume your individual position. (resisting somewhat) We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod! Zone 1. 217 locked. The sleep regulator is OK. (weakly, to Loc Rhod) No, no... I'm not ready! I'd like to talk first... Mr. Shadow on the line. Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our descent toward Fhloston Paradise... (timidly) I wanted to tell you that... (smiling) Welcome to Paradise. (looking him over) Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after the concert to open it. You little sleaze bag! Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands! (by rote) You know women normally change five times more than men. Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women. OK, you can turn around! I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad? Do you know how this works? And you can't concentrate with me around?. (seething) You're nothing but a... a... ...to who? (smiling) Apipoulai! Don't worry.  This is my fate... How was the concert? (weak) You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you... The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife... Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them. She needs you. She needs your help and your love. She's more fragile than she seems... She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live! Do you love her? I don't have time... I need to know. I would like to have died in peace... (very weak) They are... with me... (hot to trot) All this is terribly exciting, hmmm? (terrified, still deaf) What? (feeble) Kor... ban... Korben... Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert? Yes, Sir! Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel. I'm so very sad. Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy... Protect life... Until death. (feeble) The wind blows... the fire burns... ...The rain falls... I'm so tired... I want to sleep... forever... (weak) What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them! ...Like love... But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own. I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life. Why?... Why would you need me? Tell me... Now you're allowed to kiss me. We go live in one minute, Mr. President. No ma'am... I tried... No ma'am... Some woman... claims she's Korben's mother... Don't pull that crap with me, Finger... I'd recognize that trash can voice of yours in a dark alley during a rain storm. You tell that worthless no account son of mine he should plotz for the way he's ignored his mother... when I think of all I sacrificed for him...
