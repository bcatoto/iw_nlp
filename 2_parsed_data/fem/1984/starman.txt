Marc Shermin, National Security  Agency.  This has always been my favorite  time of day.  Any signs of biological contamination,  excessive radiation, anything like  that?  Can you see under the faceplate?  There's a good chance you could be  wrong about this thing then...  Was there visual contact?  It could have been anything.  People have made mistakes in these  situations before.  Oh, Jesus.  The other one is alive!  Get Fox.  It's real, George.  I saw it with my own eyes. We've  killed an extraterrestrial and...  None. And there's another one in the  area that's alive. I don't know if  it's the only one. I don't know if  it was left here by accident or it's  part of an inva...  Neither did I.  We'll need a lot of help, George.  You could hide an army up here.  Wait, wait... What are my orders if  we find this thing?  What do you mean by 'contain?'  I hope so... We'll see... See you  tomorrow... Bye. Bye.  Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a  little league game tomorrow.  Lock in.  Give it a rest, Lyman.  Any reports about monsters, people  in Halloween masks, anything like  that?  Then it's not an accident that they  found us.  Not necessarily bad! If they knew we  were here why didn't they let us  know they were coming?  That's not going to happen, George,  unless you get us the help you  promised us.  Don't let them do it this way, George.  It's too important. We can't find  this thing alone.  We always were.  Damn!  Please don't hurt me... please...  please.  It's got to be here... it's got to  be here...  No... please don't...  The creature was hit three times...  ...the arm, the abdomen and the upper  chest, the one in the chest being  the cause of death. It shattered,  for want of a better term, the  creature's backbone. It's not really,  because it's not jointed. It's simply  a hollow shaft of very pliable  silicate material, as is its entire  endoskeleton. The creature seems to  have tremendous regenerative powers.  Although it must have died within  minutes of receiving the fatal wound,  the arm and abdomen wounds are almost  totally healed and the bullet here... has begun to dissolve...  It has veins but no blood. We think,  and this is just speculation, that  some form of energy flows from the  brain, which is much more  sophisticated than ours, throughout  the rest of the body... We don't  think there is any danger of bacterial  contamination. Our biochemistries  are too different...  The flesh is gelatinous, the skin is  very porous and very moist. This is  another guess, but it probably comes  from a planet that receives only  reflected light, perhaps from a ring  of moons. Its atmospheric pressure  is slightly less than ours and it  contains a great deal more water...  They're so advanced... I... eh...  can't imagine what they would want  from us. I know they could be  dangerous. But they could also be  the greatest thing that ever happened  to mankind...  Don't... don't do this... please...  You're hurting me. Stop.  Oh, God, no! I'm not leaving this  house with you. You're going to hurt  me, I know...  I can't. I'd like to help. You look  like Scott, but I know you're not. I  don't know what you are. You gotta  understand, I'm afraid of you...  Why are you doing this to me? I'll  give you whatever...  Which way do you want to go?  You can go that way... That way... That way...  God, what are you?  I'm sorry...  That green dot, that's us, isn't  it... and the red's where you want  to go?... You don't understand me,  do you?  I gotta get out of here.  What?  Ah... no...  Steering wheel...  Steering wheel.  Gear shift.  Dashboard.  Eh... police.  What?...  Steering wheel... What?  Good.  Which way?  Flashlight.  Coupons.  Pancakes.  Help me!!  He's kidnapping me!!!  Call the police!!  Help me!!!  He doesn't understand... just walk  away...  Could you put the gun down?  Gun... Down... Down.  Thank you.  There's nothing... No reports of  sightings or landings or anything...  in the other parts of the country or  overseas... Seems like a totally  isolated incident.  I know, but...  You married, Major?  To the same woman?  I tried it once... Fourteen years  ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a  worse father. The only thing I'm  good at is this... At least until  yesterday.  How would you describe the sounds we  heard coming out of that thing's  helmet?  Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire  this morning. When a citizen went to  her rescue the kidnapper threatened  him with a gun and shouted at him in  a strange 'clicking gibberish'...  The police think he was high on  drugs...  What do you think?  It was the husband. The police finally  got a hold of the witness at work  and showed him a picture of the woman.  Why the clicking language though?  Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's  been some trouble next door. I'd  like to ask you a few questions.  There's a possibility that Mrs.  Haydn's been kidnapped. We're hoping  you might have seen something.  I told you...  Well, maybe these men won't think  so. We were asleep when a helicopter  woke me up. It made me so nervous I  went into the kitchen for something  to eat. I happened to look out the  window and there was Scott Haydn  with this green thing draped over  his arm pulling Jenny down the walk  to the car.  I know what I saw. I've seen him  enough times.   What's so funny about X?  George, we've just confirmed the  existence of the live  extraterrestrial.  Well, we're in pursuit of a green  Mustang...  Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at  gunpoint and from what we can make  out is forcing her to drive it  somewhere.  No, no... A .45, it probably got it  in the woman's house. They were last  seen in downtown Eau Claire...  It's taken on a disguise.  It's made itself look like the woman's  dead husband.  The extraterrestrial now looks like  this.  Money.  Money.  We're going to have to stop for gas  soon.  Smile.  Yes.  Minneapolis.  What are you doing?  ...What's that?  You're full of tricks, aren't you?  We need gas.  No gas.  This car runs on gas.  Gas...  No gas.      No gas... car dead. We need gas. I don't want to get  shot for running out of gas.  Yes. Very good.  Gas...  It's closed... closed. We need one  that's open.  You'll see.  Not what. Who. What is for things. What? What? What? What? For people  you use who. Who is he? Who is she? Who are you?  I am Jenny Haydn.  Who are you?  That's a big help. Where are you  from?  Are you from up there? Space?  Up there... I... eh... can't  explain... But that's the only place you could  be from.  Closed.  I know.  My... husband.  No. I don't know what you are, but  you're not Scott.  Shit.  No, no... don't say that. Bad word.  Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse  than a parrot!!  Mouth closed... closed.  I see it.  Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put  the gun down. Under the seat. Under  the seat...  Oh God! You're going to get us both  killed. Okay... in your pocket...  In your pocket... pocket...  In your pocket, please...  Okay.  I'm going to the ladies' room. You  stay here.  Go back to the car.  See. It's a bathroom. I'm not trying  to escape. I just have to go to the  bathroom.  Satisfied? Now get out. Out.  Women... me.  Men. You go in here.  Come on.  Just a minute.  It's still a toilet. Hasn't become a  ballroom.  That's very good.  Yes.  Candy.  Here.  A drink.  You want to try it?  This stuff could kill... Be my guest.  Eh... you keep it. I've had enough.  What's the matter?  Kidnapped is what you're doing to me  now!!! Kidnapped is pointing a gun  at me and taking me from my house!  Kidnapped is changing yourself into  my husband. I don't know what you  are and I don't care. I just want to  get away from you!  Horses.  Music.  What are you doing?!  You sure you want this, because...  that's putting an awful lot of faith  in people we have no control over...  I don't like it, George...  It's messy... the thing's got a gun...  We're just asking for somebody to  get killed...  You'll get results one way or the  other, that's for sure... Okay.  Are you ladies through?...  Good... It looks like we might be  the welcoming committee, so I think  we should try and figure out what  we're gonna do if we have to come  face to face with this creature.  Did your people have any contingencies  rehearsed?  Terrific.  Red light!  Stop!!!  That was a red light!! I told you  you have to stop at a red light!!  You didn't even see it.  You better.  Why are you going here? What is here?  When do you have to be here?  How will I do this one?...  Sun...  Sun... day. No sun... night. You  understand?  How many days and nights do you have  to go... ...here?  That's not much time. I'll just slow  you down. I have to sleep. I'm very  tired. And I have to wash and eat.  You don't...  I won't tell anybody if that's what  you're worried about. I promise.  You'll keep...  You'll keep the car. I'll take a  bus... Am I going up there with you... in  your ship... up there?  Then let me go. You don't need me.  I feel like I'm going crazy here.  You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't  know what's real anymore. I can't be  here with you.  Do you understand what I'm saying to  you? You can keep the car. That should be enough for gas from  here to there. Please let me go.  You bastard.  My baby!!! He's stealing my baby!  Burt!!  Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was  stealing my baby!!  He was trying to steal Gloria.  Stop it!!! Stop it!!!  Get away from him!! Leave him alone!!  You stupid jerks!! He's retarded!!  Can't you see that?!! Get away from  him!!  He was stealing my baby...  You're wrong!! He would never do  anything like that!! Let's go...  He had Gloria in his hands!  He's retarded! I shouldn't have left  him alone!  Get out of my way.  Are you okay?  Thank you.  The closest I was able to get you  was Lathrop Wells...  Yes.  Eh... yes...  No... The closest...  I'd love to have a baby. But I  can't...  I can't... Forget the baby. Okay?  The closest I was able to get you  was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to  hitchhike the rest of the way.  I know that. But the buses don't go  there.  That's easy. I'll explain that in a  minute. This is your ticket. When  you get on the bus here, the driver  will take this part. You will ride  to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask  the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please.  I do not speak English.'  Say it.  The driver will...  Will you please do it my way? You'll  get into trouble if you don't. If  anybody talks to you, tell them... I  do not speak English.  Right. In Omaha the driver will put  you on the bus for Salt Lake City  and the new driver will take... ...this part. When you get to Salt  Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas,  please'...  You want this ticket?  Then don't be smart.  That's your bus. When you get to Las Vegas, ask the  driver. 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do  not speak English.'  You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike... You stand on the side of the road,  the highway... you understand? And  you face the cars going in the  direction you want to go. When you  see a car or a truck coming, you  stick out your thumb like this...  Your thumb tells the driver that you  want a ride.  Not every car, but... a car will  stop... Maybe not the first car...  maybe number eight, number fifteen...  Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking  right away and...  ...you'll have plenty of time to get  to where you want to go.  Don't worry. They're not going to  hurt you. Come on. Only show this to the driver. Nobody  else. And don't lose it.  No.  You might need this.  Don't be afraid. Do what I told you  and you'll be okay.  Well... I'm going to go now.  Yes. I have a long ride ahead of  me... Goodbye.  Yes?  I'll stay till you get on the bus.  See? You're going to be okay.  Goodbye.  It's a kiss... Goodbye...  Oh no...  What happened?  Okay, you win. Get in.  This kind of thing's real bad for  business...  Those kind of people should be shot.  Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't  Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.  You saw that?  I wouldn't think so.  We will. Something's wrong here. She's helping  him now.  Doesn't make sense.  Why did your ship land on this  planet... on Earth?  You thought we were a different  planet?!  Stars... When a sun is far away, we  call it a 'star.'  You did? That's funny. So did we.  Yes.  The captain...  Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was  he a good friend?  A friend is a person that is good to  you... someone you like to be with...  someone you like to laugh with...  The police shouldn't have started  shooting. But you can hardly blame  them. You surprised them. They didn't  know you were up there. When they  saw you, they thought you were here  to hurt us.  Sounds like your captain's going to  get hell when he gets back home.  It's bad.  What are you doing?  Yes.  Nobody knows.  I don't know.  I've noticed... Do you understand  what they're saying?  Do you have music up there?  I'd like to hear it. Can you sing  something?  Don't be afraid... I'd really like  to hear it.  Please.  That was beautiful.  Yes. Sing some more.  How much are your rooms?  You have one with two beds?  I'll take that.  Credit card.  We're only going to be here a few  hours...  Put that back.  Put it back.  You shouldn't drink so much of that  stuff. It's bad for you.  Hurry up.  No. Get in.  I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive  for a little while longer.  No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.  No.  No!!! No!!!  Get this back to the copter.  Mrs. Haydn, please come out. We don't  want to hurt you or your friend.  Please put down your weapon and come  out.  Okay, fan out. These people have a  gun but we want them alive.  Understand?  Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt  you. Put down your gun and come out.  We just want to talk to your friend.  Don't forget to tell the boys where  you had a good time.  Tell him I'm not here.  Get me a radio. At least I won't  have to look at his face.  I'll make this as simple as I can,  George. They disappeared.  George, listen to what you're saying.  This thing's changed itself into a  man. Disappearing may not be that  big a deal.  Maybe... look, this is just something  to think about... from what I got at  the shopping center, it was more  scared than anything else... I don't  feel it's as big a threat as you  think it is...  I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm  doing my damndest to catch them.  Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on  70 past Grand Junction. They're  heading west. If they're not flying  we have a damn good chance of getting  them. All I'm asking is that you  people think about it.  Hello... hello.  Hello. Where are you?  Where did you stop last?  Where did you stop last?  What was your last stop?  Where's that?  I'm looking for a guy about this  tall, with brown hair and really  gray eyes...  He had on tan cords, a plaid shirt  and a baseball cap... probably  hitchhiking.  In the last hour or so...  This is him.  You know if anybody here's going to  Wisconsin?  Anybody going to...  Anybody going to Wisconsin?  I need a ride.  I can wait.  Where's the phone?  Could you give me the highway patrol,  please?  My name's Jenny Haydn. I think you're  looking for me. I was kidnapped in  Eau Claire, Wisconsin a couple of  days ago. But I'm free now.  Jenny Haydn. I'm on my way home and  I don't want anybody I'm with shot  at when you...  You trace it yet?  This is Marc Shermin. Where are you,  Mrs. Haydn?  I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's.  Look, I just wanted to tell you that  I'm all right and I'm on my way home.  You've been through quite an ordeal,  Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where  you are and let us pick you up? We'll  fly you home.  No. You'll want to ask a lot of  questions I don't want to answer  right now. I already have a ride.  I only called to tell you I was free  and not to shoot anybody I was with  if you see me.  Is the man who kidnapped you there  now?  I told you. He let me go. I'm on my  way home.  Get a highway patrol unit over there.  Mrs. Haydn, I'm going to have to ask  you to stay where you are.  Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name  again?  Marc Shermin.  Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If  you want to ask me any questions,  call me at home in a couple of days.  I'm in the book.  Do you know what you were kidnapped  by?  Mrs. Haydn...  He doesn't want to hurt anybody.  Please leave him alone.  Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?  What's he planning to do in Lathrop  Wells? Is he meeting someone there?  I changed my mind. Thanks.  It's me again...  I need a fast ride west.  You sure this is your car?  Slow down, slow down.  I told you I'm looking for someone.  I don't know where he is.  What? No, of course not.  We better find him before that.  You get that, Lyman?  If he didn't want to go through the  roadblock, is there any other way to  get to Vegas?  Pull over. I've got to get back there.  It's easier not to tell if you don't  know.  Sure.  Don't worry. I'll be all right.  The police are waiting for you up  ahead. There's a roadblock. You have  to go back.  The police know about Lathrop Wells.  We have to go another way. Come on.  Please understand. If you go this  way, you'll never get to your ship.  The police know about Lathrop Wells.  We have to go another way. I'll get  you to your ship. I promise.  You shit! I'll decide if I go or  not. Not you. I don't know what you  do on your planet, but I didn't think  that was very nice walking out on me  like you did.  Come on.  I didn't ask to come along on this  trip, but I sure as hell am going to  be the one to say when I get off.  Any sign of either of them yet?  Okay. Tell the highway patrol to  block all major arteries off 70 from  here to Elmo's.  Where are you going?  Why can't we wait here for a ride?  We're hundreds of miles from where  you have to be.  Even if we walk five miles, it's not  going to make any difference.  Where did you learn that?  We're not going to get a ride tonight.  No one's traveling in this weather.  I will. I will. We still have another  day.  What do you want from me? There are  no cars on this road. I didn't ask  for this stupid storm.  What are you saying?  We're too far away to walk. Don't  you understand?  Why don't you send one of your radio  balloons and tell your captain that  you might be late?  Let's find a place out of the rain.  I'm sure we'll get a ride in the  morning.  We'll get a ride in the morning.  Can you close the door?  You're damn right I am.  Open your shirt.  Oh, you're warm... put your arms  around me.  Take your shirt off.  Nothing.  Good morning.  You don't forget anything, do you?  Hello... hello. How are you this  morning?  No, they don't talk... We talk to  them.  Oh, you're pretty...  Yes, they are.  But...  I told you it's impossible for me to  have a baby.  I want it.  Hello George.  What's all this for?  We don't have to do it that way. We  can catch him this time.  I've never been taken off an  assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for  you.  You can change a directive, George.  You've done it before. Listen to me.  He's going somewhere in Death Valley.  Lathrop Wells was never anything but  a bus stop. East is the nuclear site.  There are no roads in there. She was  teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling  you. We block the four roads into  Death Valley and we got him.  That's the chance we have to take.  Then you're going to have to do it  without me.  You're talking about taking a life.  The most unique life form on this  planet. I think we're better than  that.  You don't make money gambling. You  lose it.  Do you have a good map of Death  Valley?  What for?  Here are two quarters. When you lose  these, you're not going to get  anymore.  This is crazy. We don't have time  for this.  You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we  don't get a good ride before dark we  could miss your ship.  I don't need any money for the baby.  I'll be fine.  The cook again?  If I ever run into that guy, I'm  going to kick his ass.  It'll tell you pretty much everything  about us...  Any words you don't know you can  find in the dictionary.  It'll give you the different  countries, how they came to be, what  they are now, how America came to  be, the governments, the languages...  everything.  What will you say about us?  We can.  This is yours...  I'd like to...  Would you put some of your singing  in this for the baby?  Yes.  How long will it take you to get  home?  Would you like to listen to some  music?  I'm sure we could find a country and  western station.  Don't worry. Everything's going to  be fine.  Which star is yours?  Where?  Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When  the baby is born, we'll go out in my  back yard and wave to you.  They're trying to get him.  What are you doing?!!  I want to speak to Marc Shermin.  If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm  hanging up.  Mr. Shermin wants to speak to you.  Here he is.  Hello...  We can't let you do that.  All the roads into Death Valley are  blocked. We'd like to talk to you.  Hold on a minute... Let's take the  chance, George.  I'm afraid we can't let you go.  Where do you think you're going?  I said I would get you to your ship  and that's where we're going to say  goodbye.  I hope that works.  It works.  In front!!! In front!!!  Hang on.  I won't let anyone hurt you.  George... Do you hear me, George?  I just retired.  Let's get out of here.  Well...  You say you love me and kiss me  'goodbye.'  I'm never going to see you again, am   I love you.  I will.  Wait!!
