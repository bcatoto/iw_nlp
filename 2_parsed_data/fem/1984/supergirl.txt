But what will happen? But the Power Source, Zaltar. How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city. But the phantom Zone is for criminals. But where?And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl! There's no need. I learned the Craft from my grandmother. She didn't take it from you, did she? Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you. Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener? Home? Whatever you say. Yes, of course, it was foolish of me. The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest. That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one. Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power. You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth. Eliminate her. A Storm Dragon? I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger? Have fun. Is he your entertainment for tonight? Sorry, mistress. And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy! But which one? Softball. The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near . What is it?Yes. Someone's chasing him. Oh, no thanks. Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy. He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation. I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is. Theories? Nice to meet you. I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers. He's nice. I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car. Lucy; come back! Why is he acting so strangely? It doesn't seem right. Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight. No thanks. You go on. It was just a trim. But what for? Must've been a defective puck. She did that deliberately. Thank you. You're very kind. My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth. I'd rather not talk about it. I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since... There isn't any. I can do that. Sure. Mate in five moves. Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers. I'd love to. No, MR. Danvers. I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it. I'm Linda Lee. Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.Well thanks a pile, fella. Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs. Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place. Remember me? We were in a disaster together. Hey! Ethan! You're supposed to guess. You bet your ass. Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention. I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us. I can't help it if men notice me. I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building. I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested! Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die? Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second? Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming. You're not gonna stay for the ice cream? Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead! Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop. Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D. Somebody's gotta do something!! I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed. Please, as a favour to me? So I won't be the only girl? Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you. Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away... You sure? Your hair looks the same. She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her. Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you. How'd you do that? She's a beast. Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time. You're not...an orphan are you? Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something? This is all your clothes? No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?What do you mean we? At last. Ultimate Power. That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools. I don't feel like it right now. Shut up, and get me a hacksaw. No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me. Yes. Whatever I say. From now on. I think I'd better keep it. Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard. What do I do? I don't know her name. I've been saving it. For the right moment. Am I? Still? That's easy for you to say, Bianca. Why did she have to show up now? No, a super girl. It's what we were warned about. He will be. In about five minutes. Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK? We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out. Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention. It must be the girls. One of the girls. Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game? What does it mean? The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it. I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall. There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs. It's a warning, that's for sure. I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski. What do you want? That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan. I'm ready for her. I'll show you. You can't put her out of your mind, is that it? You're a regular Einstein, aren't you? Guess! Go on. They want me. Doesn't it make you proud? Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry. You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week. Go on, talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten. I could force you. I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest! Come back to my house. My car's outside. This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you. Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want. You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am. Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first. Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl? It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl. This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion. And you think you're in love. What an adorable hat. To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together. A passionfruit smoothee. Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage. I bet they do. You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around. Come in, have a drink, we'll talk. Finished your estimate? Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch. I've got things to do. George---I thought you'd never ask. Why George, are you proposing? Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants. Nonsense. Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel? Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice? We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft. Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself. I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night. I could teach you a thing or two now. You're wasting your breath. Nigel, get lost. Throw him out. You Scorpios can never take a joke. I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber. Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head. Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far. I just did. Because I have the Power. I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places. Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world. Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel. Where is inner space? Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go. What's it like? Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time. I'm free. I can never thank you enough. Not yet. The Danvers. And two of your little friends. A cheap trick. I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry. That was meant for me!Do you want to come to Argo City? I'll come back as soon as I can. How do I fight it? You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over. And you can see how you feel about me, right? What? You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source. I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park. That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live? There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil... Aren't you forgetting about Selena? Are you asking me for a "date"? Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever. I don't see why not. And now? Miss what? It seemed that way to me. Hello. Are you still mad at me? But I don't understand. I sort of like what you said. But why? Just like that? What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you? Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours. But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her. I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places. Is this how? Well...I guess one is all right. Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand. No. What's that? Of Course I don't hate you. I don't hate anyone. All this talk about love, it's silly. We're from different worlds. We can't do that. But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you. Tell me where I can find her. Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you. It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me. No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space. Yes. It reminds me of home. Are you sure it's all right for us to be here? We have to have a long talk about all this. You love me? Who didn't? Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye. I have to. Later. I'm taking you to the hospital. It's for your own protection. That's home. They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead. It's everywhere. But water is always the door. It's the most beautiful place in the universe. Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused. You could come too. It might be safer for you. For what? You've run out of things to throw, Selena. It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for. Cheap but effective. That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while. I don't scare that easily. Who are you ? Thank you. I'm going to close this up again. Zaltar! Zaltar. Use the wand! It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work. Don't stop. Keep moving. Better than when I was a child. I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart. You're going to take me back? Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die. You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers. Then come with me. Then teach me how. Why? I knew it! If there's a way in, there must be a way out. Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me. Zaltar, please help me. That horrible woman! You look at them? How? But what about other people? Don't you miss them? Are you happy, Zaltar? It's lovely. . . Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City... ...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..." Others? I know. ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone. Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source... I was on Earth... What is this place?
