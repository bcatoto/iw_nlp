I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child? They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen. I will try to pass within. Then I will teach you our way of battle.... you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit. No, but many consider my training valuable. Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close... Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker? Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death. It's a maker... It could only be one thing.... It's a crysknife. That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham. I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin. I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages. Stop him yourself. Man-carved steps. What's happened?... Why did it leave? Yes... I can't... I can't. I'm ready. ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow... He knows. Is he....? A million deaths are not enough for Yueh... Where are we do you think? Excellent! Oh great mother! He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him. Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you. Your Reverence. Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you... Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.Yes, my Lord. I am your Truthsayer, my lord... He is here, my lord. Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him. Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions.... We felt his presence. You mustn't speak of... Stop him, Jessica! They tried and died. ... Many men have tried. What can be done has been done. I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice. They tried and died.... Jessica! Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug? The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot. Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true? Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation. NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it! You feel the flesh crisping? SILENCE... SILENCE. Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat. I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals. Pain.
