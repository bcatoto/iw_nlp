Put it on a plate son you'll enjoy it  more. You father gave all our extra money  to the Reverend's telethon, Otto. We're sending bibles to El Salvador. Otto who? Come on you douche bags. (come on, get  the lead out.) Uhm how utterly charming. Leila. Is this your car? Heh, one of them? You think you're pretty  slick don't ya? I bet you're a used  car salesman. You dress like one. What's that? No. Those men in the car next to us don't  look at them. Don't look at them! If  they see me they'll kill me. Take a look at this. It isn't sausage Otto. That's a picture  of four dead aliens. Laugh away fuckface (fatface) that picture  is going to be on the cover of ever  major newspaper in two days time. Part of a secret network. A scientist  who is also in our secret sect smuggled  the corpses off of this air force base.  Now he's got them in the truck of his  car. It's a Chevy Malibu. We've got  to find him. Yes! We're going to have a press conference  and tell the world. My door doesn't open. Thanks for the ride. I don't know. I'm going to be kind of  busy with work, the Malibu and everything. What's your problem? I mean girls might  like you if you lightened up a little  bit. You wanna get back in the car? Yeah. Twenty thousand dollars for a Chevy  Malibu? Who's double X finance? Store front operation, but the money  is in escrow. Want me to notify the boys? Uh, naw. They're always bitching (crying)  about their case load. I think I'll  go out for a while. Why? We out of beer? Somebody has to work around here. Keep  making me money kid. Think you can find it now? Neither do I, but it's my birthday. Otto. Otto stop. You said you had something  to tell me. Otto? Otto! What did you want to tell me? I'm at work, Otto! Your work is different than mine. What are you doing.? Don't do that. Leila? We have a cell meeting in two  minutes time. Thanks Deadra. I'll be right there. Well I've been in the hospital you see. I'll see if I can borrow some money  from somewhere. Oh how was the rehearsal son? It was O.K. Who's this? Oh this is Mr. Otto. He's from the finance  company. He's been telling me that he  isn't going to take the car this time,  even though he could. Did you like the tea? Uh huh? You're welcome. I gave you the money last week to pay  it and you didn't do it. What did you  do with it? I'm so tired of giving you  money and you squandering it. I know  what you done you all went out dancing  some where. That's what you did. Next  time I give you some money I want you  to put it in the car ya hear. You're  working. How come you didn't do it huh?  I don't know what's happened to you.  (continues softly) Helping hand. Stop pushing Duke. What do you mean? Stolen? Hot? I got the papers. Where is the car from? Hello. Is it you? This is Leila. Are  you using a scrambler? (garbled noises in background) Look  out! What do you want from me? You're not going to torture me are you? Torture you? What for? To find out what I know. I'd torture  someone in a second if it was up to  me. Because of the trunk. The aliens inside. No, Silly, Extraterrestrials. Um. I going to have to ask my boyfriend. Oh. The usual. Jesus (Golly) who done that to yeah  son? Why don't you do something Plettschner?  Aren't you a cop or something? Just like John Wayne. Damn right just like John Wayne what's  wrong about that? What? That doesn't mean he was a homo (freak),  Miller. Lotta straight guys like to  watch their buddies fuck (play). I know  I do. Don't you? This is too personal sonny. The thing  is a repo man got beat up in the line  of duty. Now it doesn't matter that  that man was you. What really matters  is that the guy that did it has got  to pay the price. Now stop being selfish  and tell us his name. Mr. Humphries? Helping hand acceptance corporation.  Marlene speaking. Hello, is Otto there? It's for you. A girl. Hi Otto? It's Leila. Otto, these aliens aren't on ice or  anything. They could be starting to  decay. We've got to find them before  they turn into mush. Look a metal hand. Can we feel it? Charming friends you got there Otto. Hey what  you doing with our car? Kill him Duke! Kill him. Well we don't have all night. Close it Duke! No! No! Oh leave it off. Shut up Archie. Come on duke let's go do those crimes. How come that pig's got a wooden leg?  Well said the farmer said about three  months ago I was out there walking the  pig. Yeah Yeah that's what I said when the  marshal woke me up at 4 o'clock this  morning . Unfortunately it isn't bullshit  (hokum), it's a summons. Have you read it? The goddamn (gol-durn)  Rodriguez brothers are suing us for  malicious damage, medical expenses and  harassment for a car they fucking (flippin)  own. I know that bud. But we've got to sit  down and get our stories straight. I was there remember? Why don't you  go home? Take the rest of the week off. Make it a fucking (flippin) month. On second though Budsky. Don't bother  coming back at all. Shut up! By the way kid, sign this. Equity turnover. Standard practice.  Protects you in case we get sued. .  . Don't read the damn thing, kid, just  sign it. Here's the young new-waver we've all  heard so much about. My old man had a mohawk on him when  I met him. He was in the service then. He signed it over to me. But he didnï¿½t  realize- My old man was such a monster. I used  to have to tell him no. My old man was exactly the same way  until we got married. Yeah. Like flies on shit (spit). Who? What? Why? Asshole.] Up against the wall. I think a little. Bollocks. Here. (tosses Otto a bag of  popcorn) Some men were just here looking for  you, Otto. Very nice young men. They wore sunglasses. Let's go Like hell we are. Over my dead body. Come and get me. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on if you think  your man enough. I don't think he knows. But what if he's innocent? Otto, Otto pull your self together. We're going to the hospital. Let me see that. All wrong do it over. Oh well isn't that a shame. Ask him about the Malibu. Otto! Bye, Bye.
