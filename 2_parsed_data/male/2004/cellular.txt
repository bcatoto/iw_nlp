I don't see anybody in there but you. This is one way. Where do you think you're going?We've already got an ambulance on the way. Don't try to get out. It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this. We were trying to overtake him. Are you guys all right?I told you I should've cuffed him. Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law. These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights. Can you make him stop! How do we get back to the freeway? Any time you decide to let me in on it. Only I was sloppy. I let you take me out. That was quite a humiliation. In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase. Yes sir. You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side? You stupid fuck! Lady, don't let him do it! What's this? Let's have your license, mister. Why would I do that? They'll wait. Meantime, raise the lid. Now that'd be a misdemeanor. You never miss a trick. Now turn around. I'm going to cuff you. So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed. A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with! You can tell she was really worried about me. It took you long enough to get my ass out. Look, I've got a wife. I don't care if either of you ever get caught.Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights. Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen. Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice. We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing. Oh. Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise. Wake up. Make a right at Ocean Avenue. The hotel's a few blocks up on the left. Have you got to tell her your life story? That's all we need. Better let me drive. Sure -- and they record your voice. And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out! In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody. Got your badge? Let's hope so. Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over. First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count. I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a Hockney . We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby. You're doing all the talk. Make a "U" and go back. Shit. There's the hotel. You overshot the driveway. Just like they say; no fucking self control. Just hand up on the bitch! Fuck you, madam. And goodbye! What do you mean tip the cops? Is the man a lunatic or what? That's your "rep." That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked. I heard you were a hitter. We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation. So let's go over this again step by step. You switched license plates?Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die -- Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die. You mustn't hang up. Thank God -- thank God I've got you.Yeah. Why don't we? Seems like it. Don't worry. She's yours. What are we waiting on? That's how it is. You see her approaching you toss out installment one. I'm opening the side door. She'll step out. But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view. If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back. And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van. And then? And not a nickel. Negative. Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter. Her husband said there'd be one million eight. So nine hundred to you. You should've done all this before. It's in the process. We're waiting on you. We're waiting for the light to cross the highway. It just changed. We're in a grey van. It reads " Noble Carpet Cleaners ." I don't know what you mean. Satisfied? Talk to the man. You'll see her. Just relax. It's your call. Stay there. We don't see you. You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular. 308-9962. Sure. She's somewhat damaged in the shipping. But nothing makeup won't cover. Some loyalty. We can be there. What time frame have you got in mind? Pass. Where do we meet? There are no guarantees in this life. Keep talking. You're up on your details, aren't you? You got time on your side. Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass. Whatever you say. Twenty percent. Who are you working for?I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place. Get this door open! No reason to kill innocent bystanders. Shit. I can't hardly move my neck. You could've killed us. Give me 20 minutes at least. I was worried about you. Both of you. I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic. Are you there yet? There's a taxi stand here. I can meet you. Don't fuck around. Pop a cap in him. We'll toss it when we make the blind curve. What am I supposed to do? I thought you said you could handle him. Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend. Nobody can do anything right but you! Them. They won't be expecting us. Stay put! I know my way around. Are you busting my chops or what? In your dreams. None of your business, but it's in the cab. That's all mine. When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty. I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards. How do you know? And make ourselves a hell of a target. Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco. It'll be a narrow winding road. You can't miss the house. It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake. Five minutes. In the hills above Sunset. Just below the Getty. Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds. I may need to pry that information out of her. What do you stand to gain? I can see the benefit in that. That bitch. What's keeping you from taking off? Why would she want me to think you were on ice? What does it take to kill you? Who's this? Yeah? I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego. And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life! You want us to get ourselves killed? There's two police cars now. The fuck I will! And if you ditch us we get zilch. If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask. Call me "Nels." What's he doing? Answer me!Was I picking on you? How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand? Mind if I have a look? If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing? Only you don't have a flat.I would appreciate a little space. Thank you. I know. But it's an emergency. Somebody dying. Okay? Any place. Hey Buddy! Can you let me pull over? Give me some space to pull over. I'm sorry. You'll do all right without me. Keep my share. Then whose is it? Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line. This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like? Did you have to tell her my name? She can't! It's busted. Now hand that on back! I know where it is. Give me that phone back. How was I in the wrong? I'm trying to help somebody. Okay? Say something ... I didn't hurt you. You could've made me lose my call. I'll explain later. I'm sort of on hold. I want the gun emptied. I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out. That's all. OUT ! I'm the one they'd be looking for. Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation? Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die. Particularly if you're not expecting it. You don't know what hit you. Bear right till the fire road ends. It's not far. You missed. Or relieve me of it later. Nels reporting in. Sit down where you are. Arms folded. You got it wrong. I'm the one that's on your side. See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury. On the job. I'm going to level with you officer. What'd you do? Tail me from Brentwood? I got to get going. An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes. Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I. What do you keep making me out to be? Satisfied, Wiseass? It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there. I improved on the fucking original. Go ahead then. I'm covering the receiver. She can't hear. That's illegal. You want us pulled over? I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up. And stop with the directions. If you know that just back off. I don't like anybody laying their hands on me. That's what I deserve for listening in the first place. Will you relax? This in no way affects our business. Go on. Wait! I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again. Bullshit. Not this minute. It's taken care of. Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you. I don't want it. Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man. Toss them -- one at a time. I don't want to lose count. It's going to be some fucking snowstorm. Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per? Know what else is in here? Exactly who was this Oberfeld? Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me. Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again. No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you. Nothing but CDs in there. I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney. I'm handling it. That's how it's going to be. I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house. It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone. Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us. Naturally. Which one of us is elected to do the deed? What's your point? That's a reasonable possibility. What's really on your wicked little mind? How about "later?" Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion. You've had a lot of fun with me today. What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call? Who'd ever think, to look at you? I need a break. I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you. Developer ran out of money years back. I'd hate to think about what's living in there. I had it in my mind what you'd look like. "Her," I could've painted. You , I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors. That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas. I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me. I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen. We cleared some of these same roads. Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed. What's happening? That's why we're turning off onto a fire road. Ask them. Dial him up. We need him to run interference. What's Nels' number? It could be a fire. This is Malibu. Let me talk to him. Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me. Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you. We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are. In case I ever need to roll over on somebody. Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return. All parts intact. Then scream for me. A repeat performance. Let me see how easy you can turn it on. Scream! I want to hear you scream for me! Yes I would. Not kill you. But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution. It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish -- Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts. Now you're starting to sound like a victim again. You're enjoying this too much. I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims. You were at the Emerald that night? You, I would've noticed. What's that supposed to me? Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good. That's on their head. All I did I was put him there. Granted, the cops are not an alternative. Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk. I'm not trying to lose them. Nor am I exceeding any speed limits. Absolutely. And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall. We might hit a bump and the gun might go off. Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident? Not all. They already have a third. The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back? Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it. I probably killed some poor bastard for it. Assure them that you're being well treated. Your friends are probably still on the line. Pick it up and say hello. L.A.P.D. You knew about me. Why pick me to be your "mark?" There was no cop involved. Oh shit! Fuck! And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop -- I got what I fucking deserved. I had it all. I could've kept going! You timed that beautifully. At least one. Damned if I know. The guy with the transplant. Whose money is this? You're not Lenore Oberfeld. Why are you telling him that. Are you crazy? For Christ sakes don't point it at me. We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece. I'm waiting for the girl. Her mother wants to talk to her. Somehow I got along better with you on the phone. It's all there isn't it? So far they're keeping their part of it. We've almost got your husband and your daughter out. So don't get any ideas. Because a lot of people would've gotten killed. Probably all the wrong ones. Now I have -- it's a long story. Include me in that. She'll be with you soon. They're pulling up. They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain. Shit. I'm sorry. Just start walking. Come on. Walk to me. Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us. She's a child. She might panic. She doesn't know me. She might not come to me. She might just run. They won't allow that. It's one at a time. And you have to be first. Can you walk? Don't start thinking about it. Is the tape off? She's next. In two or three more minutes she'll be free. Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions. We're almost there. Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me. Put the man back on. Now you're going to do just what I tell you to. No discussion. No hesitation. You're all three of you in that van? Your husband? That's coming off. How about the girl? Are you okay? I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying. And I'm in a position to negotiate. What about your husband and your child? I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy. Lucky for them they didn't. Hi Lenore. It's me. I got you back. Courtesy of Star 69. Are you hurt? Try what you did before. It worked before. I won't talk anymore. Don't panic. I might be wrong. Hello? I guess I was wrong. Or somebody else there is listening in -- Did you hear that click? Did you jiggle the phone? You can't give up. Why tell me this? I've got a lot of respect for you too. For the way you feel about your family. Yeah, sure that's me. Ask anybody. It won't be him. I might still get there first. The lights are with me. How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank? What's going on? How come everybody turns out to be a crook? You're doing what you can. Why's all this money stashed? I'm pretty good at signatures myself. They've still got to be able to sign his name. They'll recognize it's not your husband. Do you know what's in that box? Not a chance. I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood. That bank is our best bet. If anybody shows up I could follow them. Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here. I'm not doing too well. What's the matter? Black Mercedes, 600S. Wait just a minute. Our luck has changed. What bank? You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box? I should've put them out of the car and come sooner! He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him. I'm trying to. She's gone -- I've got to ask somebody. Does she wear glasses? Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail? Great. Stay with me. There must be a hundred kids out here. Lenore, I'm here. I'm getting out. I'm making my turn. I see the school up ahead. There are cables overhead. Hang on. It'll clear up. That makes two of us. I'm about ten blocks from the school. A price on everything. Shit, stop with the money! I never asked for a nickel. I was just doing this. And you have to fuck it up with a price tag. Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary. They say my work is somewhat derivative. Pictures. Sometimes I paint. Well you did. I sure as hell got my wish. She doesn't exist. So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all. It never healed. I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her. "Click." You don't exist. Hey drop it, okay? I don't know. I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of. I don't know. 80 or 90 minutes, tops. Where's the fucking recharger cord? Must be in her car, dammit. I'm not looking to get myself killed. I just hope the battery on this phone holds out. Tell me what she looks like. What do you think I'm doing? I'm on my way to the school like you wanted. I kind of dropped them off. They were getting on my nerves. Hello? It's just me and you again. Another minute. Just hang on. I've got a life of my own. Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me. Forget who I am. Where's this school located? He's right? Look, don't try to put blood on my hands. You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him! Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go. Bottom line! There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops. What do they need her for? Stop throwing names at me. I'm with two friends now. Don't move around. You don't want to puncture a lung. I'm fine. She's back on. Hello? I'm here. I can't stay on this line. I'm picking people up. I'm already overdue. Hello? Fine, no tunnel. Are you still with me? Hello? Shit! I'm in traffic. There's no place to turn. Listen, there's an overpass coming up. I may lose you for a minute. Oh man. These people mean business. Who? What makes you say that? The cops could trace this call back to you. Okay. The police are gonna need your full name and address. Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone? Where'd they take you to? Why would anybody want to hurt you? Don't lay this on me! Oh won't I? I am not involved. Keep clicking your little wires. You'll get someone else. Good luck. Don't expect me to tell you who I am. I don't want to know -- You're the one who's not to be believed. You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care. Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life. This has gotta be some "put-on," right? Sure. And they left you upstairs to make phone calls? Who smashed the phone? What'd you do! Just pick my number out of the air? Lady, try making some sense. And what're you whispering for? No. You don't understand! You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates. And I've got no time to screw around. If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying -- Do I know you? I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day. Didn't we play this scene before? Who is this? What are you planning to do when they got here? They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel. Put the girl on. Next I want to see Rachel. Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do. Keep her calm. Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car. Count it. I'm backing up. Stop the crying. I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she? Are you trying to panic the women? I won't let 'em. You pull up -- collect your first installment. Then you let the daughter go. When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third. Same action. I back up again -- you pull forward. Satisfy yourself it's there. Then we do it one last time. The final exchange. And we go our separate ways. Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom. You'll still have the girl and the husband. Thanks for the sound advice. Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here. Alone. My pleasure -- I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio. I make my end of the cash at 184,000. Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds. What the face value is. Then just wait. I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady. And her little girl. I still don't see you. You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work. I don't want to see her later. I want to hear her now . I don't need to relax. The woman. Put her on. Fucking "A" it is! Any argument and I'm out of here. I don't want you within two hundred feet. Park down by the lifeguard station. Nobody gets out. I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand. I'm here. Where are you? I wish it had never been invented. Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot. Take my number. When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange. It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back. Got a phone in that van? Tell the lady to relax. Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person. There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass. I want you all in one vehicle. Your van. If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances. You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got. It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from? A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide. Temescal Canyon parking lot. It's a nice day. How about the beach? Granted. But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures. You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you. You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison. He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence. They saw you kill the driver. You're making it too easy. Fine. I want half. Plus the release of the family. I'm self employed. What kind of cut did the hairy one have? I'm in awe. Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away. In which case you just warned them. Who were you talking to? Somebody better tear this down before it falls down. Don't underestimate me. I've got original ideas of my own. Warhol got famous doing a soup can. What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics? Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come. Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels. You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts. At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me. Where's the backpack? Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them. Believe me. They couldn't be busier at the moment. We're gonna get there first. Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together. Where do I turn? How far off are you? Take the 405 south. Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end. You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack. My compensation! Somebody still owes me -- big time! Intelligent question, Nels. I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity. I suppose you're in your taxi? I thought you'd know me by now. Nels! Guess who? A friendly voice from beyond the grave. You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels. Yeah? Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends. Tighten your belts. Here it comes. Ready? From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman. There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you. Tailgate me. I'll jam on the brakes. You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off. You researched me. You know where I live. She'll be waiting for you there along with your split. It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying. Tell the man. You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked. Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of. If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here. I think I've already had a "quickie." Thank you. Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about. I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests. Who am I talking to? Better reassure him. Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak. Why are you picking on me for? Something was rattling around. Some loose tools. Seems not. Since when did you guys start changing tires? If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about. If you've already killed her that's fine. I'll keep the bonds and the cash. We got nothing to discuss. Let me talk to the lady again. Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase. So I've taken on the task. From here on, I dish it out. Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation. Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up? Your partners are currently armed and we're not. Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch. Undercover. Very official. 259-7881, if I recall. Can I make a quick call? You've got a phone ?You sure know how to take a lot of punishment. Who the fuck you kidding? Send me money! The 405 is coming up. I thought so. What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this? Government business? Doesn't everybody? I already called for an ambulance.Let her tell you. Hold on. There's no lady here. Who are you?
