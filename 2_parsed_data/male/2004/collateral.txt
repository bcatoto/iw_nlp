You sure? You look pretty shaky... You dizzy? You want to sit down? Save me the grief. Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk. This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it. Get you towed. Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk. I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab. You still carrying passengers? A deer? This your current address?I know the answer. I know all there is to know about Louis. Lay it on me. One more thing. If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry. How do I know you'll keep your word? What kind of question? And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy. You know Dmitri? The crowd was most kind. I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964. That was the moment of my conception. Right here in this very room. Most vividly. "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..." ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog. Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played. So Pops, he just waves me right up. My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes. Oh, my, yes. Did better'n that. Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence. Louis was playing. God was smiling. He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show. After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk. That's how he was, you see. Never forgot where he came from. Money and fame an' all that? Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn. So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing. Right through those doors. The man himself. ...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place. Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point. Being around the music, that was the thing. And I was. Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in? Mr. Louis Armstrong.Very generous. Twenty five? Vincent. Do not cross me. Can you finish on schedule? Tell me. Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children? Federal? What? What did you say? What? Tell me Vincent. Tell me what you think. Neither do I. But my children, they're still young. Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas? His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids. That was Black Peter's job. He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night. And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door. That was a warning. If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again. Tell me, Vincent. Do you believe in Santa Claus? Sorry? I see. That was an important list, wouldn't you say? The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge. And you "lost" it?What are you gonna do? I don't know... ...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo. That guy? That guy is a cabbie. And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares? ...got off the phone with his dispatcher. What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years... Can you fax me his picture? His license or something? What do you mean you don't have that there? Anybody else in the cab? ...Petrov and Cicerno for sure... Something going on? ...if they're wrong?! What if they're wrong? Detective Sergeant Phil Heller. Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there. Joey Cicerno. Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov. Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri. ...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue. The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker. Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness. Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself? Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives. Wiseguys. I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab. I never bought that. They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority. Cabbie drove around all night. Three people got killed. Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab? There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it. Ivan flew out the window and went bam. Oh, we working for the Feds now? If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours. Months now. He's been feeding me information on Dmitri. Ivan Petrov. Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up. I come here, find this....show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, up ... I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over. Yo, whassup?Nothin'! Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow! Get him on the line, please. What are you guys, taking an all-night tour? Who is this? Maaaaaax! Max? Maaax. Pick up, dipshit. I was just tryin' to...to... Let's not get excited, sir. Who the hell is this? I know you're out there! Answer the goddamn call! Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up. I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'! So? Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it. I just got off the phone with the cops. They called to check you brought the cab in... Max! Dammit! Answer!...what do you want me to do, punch him out? I have to work with him... ...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way... ...why is everything always about you...Yes! Stay put, goddamn it! Don't move from that spot... He doesn't know you're up there! Just stay right where you are! Call the police! Where are you, what floor? ...he's two floors below you. No, no, wait ... It doesn't matter! Just get out of the goddamn building... Dmitri hired him! He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you! He was stalking you when I dropped you off. I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead. Kill you! He's coming to kill you! Listen to me! Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you! Max, the cab driver! Annie...it's Max. Sure thing. Yes, you could. I think you need it more than I do. It'll help. I promise. Dozen times a day. Soon. But I take little ones all the time. Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. Not in a cab... I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together... You need a vacation. But not now? You never answered my question. You like what you do? Big case? ...Bottega. Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer. You? Definitely Clarence Darrow. Sure. I'm starting an 800 hotline. Caught part of your phone call. And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega... You like being a lawyer? Travel...and things. This? Temporary. To pay the bills and save. I got plans... There were two of us. I had the other guy killed. Don't need the competition... It's no big deal. Keep it. Go wild. Have a party. Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone. Let me guess. Clarinet? You like Bach? No. I got lucky with the lights. The ride is free. But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want. First Friday of the month? Linens. Roll right off the trucks. They're in and out in twenty minutes... ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago. Traffic will be smooth. The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges. Sixth is faster. I'll take Sixth. It's faster. Hi ya' doin'? Where to? I'm...fine. Fine. Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break? I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear. I won't budge from this spot. I was heading back to my garage. It's on the way. Comin' over Coldwater. Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me. You believe that? Yes. By the way. Daniel said he was sorry. Hell, make it fifty. Same goes for any business we have in the future. As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight. Twenty five percent. Wouldn't dream of it. In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied. The fat man on Cherry Street. The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer. The trumpet player. That leaves two. You think I wanted to come here tonight? You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it. You tell me. I had to toss the list in the river. I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass. So why don't you show a little courtesy? I picked up a tail. I said. Get the gun. Out. Of my fucking face. Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you. I think... ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face. I think... Can't say that I do. I'm sorry. I came to see you, you look fine. We gotta go. I'm standing right here. I'm...in...the...room, here. Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room. Mom, Vincent. Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke. He paid for 'em. You're gonna cheer up. I brought you flowers. I got caught up at work. Hi, Ma. ...oh God, don't shoot me... My hands are taped to the fucking steering wheel! You're kidding me. I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere. Oh. Oh, thank God, hey! Hey, guys, hey, help me out here! Yeah? It got crashed! I didn't... Yeah? So? Uh, yeah? Lenny? It's me. He'll keep calling. Let her go. Was your seatbelt fastened, honey? Vincent? What are you gonna do, pull the trigger? Kill us? Go ahead, man! Shoot ...my ass. But you know what? Nothing matters, anyway. We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat. Right? Yeah. That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro. And I never saw it that way... I should have done that. Fixed it and more. Get out from under what I been under... 'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves... None of your business. Answer the question. Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said: "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you... 'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone... To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life... Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.? Open your eyes in the morning? I don't think you do...I don't think so... I think you are way low ...like in your estimation. In your estimation of yourself. So how'd you get that way...? What happened to you? Then what are you? That's the reason? What'd they do? That's what you said... You're full of shit. Whyn't you kill me and find another cab. One more. What's at Union Station? Some living. Yeah, so, what's wrong with that? No, not just that. That cop! Why'd you have to do that? You couldn't wound him? The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me... You had to kill Heller?! I only owe you a ride, Vincent. I don't know. Who? Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner. Twelve minutes. Makes two of us. Paid sick leave? You get benefits? In case he asks. How long have you been a hit man? Vincent. Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed. I...I wasn't thinking. I just did it. No. No way. I can't do this. He's gonna shoot me? Why me? Why don't you do it? I don't get it. Dmitri? In case who checks? Why? Doesn't cover everything. See, I've got bills. My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid. I told you I don't like to talk about it. I've always been good. Ever since I started. Gave up piano. Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started. Go figure it all out... It's not bullshit. I'm sorry. What happened? Yeah? What happened? Fuck! Nothing's ever goddamn good enough! It's always been that way. She hears what she wants to hear, okay? Don't start. Jazz. You'd do her a favor. Mom, Vincent's not interested. There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother! What difference does it make? She's in the hospital. Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay? Sure? Like you didn't play him? String him along? If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go? I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this! I don't wanna know you! Leave me alone. I'm done. Find another cab. No. You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a little jazz, huh? Let him go, Vincent. I'm not catching a melody. That what we're doing? Flowing? I never learned jazz. I listen to classical. I'm...what? Sorry? Am I collateral? Vincent? I don't understand... What? Yeah. Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass. Lenny? You're an asshole. I need the job. I can't do that. He's the Man. He'll fire my ass. It was an accident. I'm not liable. Lenny, my dispatcher. Why? I'll deal with it. I will, I will... I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them. I can't believe this. Please. Don't do anything. How? Oh, it's okay, then. 'Cause you're just taking out the garbage... I don't know any Rwandans. Rwanda-Burundi. Central Africa. Who was he? How can you kill him like that? What'd he do to you? I Ching? You threw a man out a window! Music. Yes. You don't understand. I mean it. Really. I'm not up for this... Listen. I'm not trying to piss you off, see? Okay? I can't drive you around so you can murder folks. You said you were visiting friends! Oh. Oh, no. You're kidding. We... South Central. It's a mess. I think so. What? Okay, try it now. The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor... I tried it. It's not me, it's the engine! A fat guy fell on it from six floors up! Yes! I'm trying, I swear! It's not me. I'm trying... Uh, look...why don't you just take the car... His hand moved! His goddamn hand twitched! Yeah. I don't think I can do this. The trunk? With what? I'm cool. You're cool. You - you killed him? I think he's dead. Yeah, yeah. Shit, man. Guy fell on my motherfucking cab. He fell on my cab! From up th-th-there. Max. Two, two-fifty. I'm not a hire car. It's against regs? Yeah. Lucky with the lights. I don't talk about it, you know... No offense. Twelve years. But I'm working on other stuff... Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking. This job's a fill-in. Me, specifically? It's not that kind of job. You mean like benefits? People are more relaxed. Less stress, less traffic, better tips. Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy. I see your point. It's home. First time in New York? An apology. Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge. Eleven to get downtown. Four to the Lower East Side. Six to clear the roadwork. One minute margin for error. My math says twenty-four. Twenty-four minutes. Yeah, yeah, sorry... Oh. Sorry.This isn't our goddamn game! Not our call, Phil. Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD. Pick me up in five minutes. Jesus. Two in one night? Elvis? Oh? So? It was a random thing. Oh, right. The guy flipped out or something? Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head? What thing? He could'a been depressed. It still doesn't tell me homicide. What homicide? Phil. Where's a body? Look. All we got is glass... Dmitri Gusunov? What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him. They're a heartbeat away from taking him down. Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him... You guys been holding hands? ...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?Take him down. Save Richard Yip, our witness... Lemme tell you something. Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts. Nobody even know what he looked like until now... No. Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab. So? Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place... ...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight... Pretty quiet down there. A cab just pulled up, aside from that...Then let's have it. It's simple. What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument? Of course. I never lie. Ask Max. Max, have I lied yet? Jazz question. What other kind is there? You get it right, we roll with it. You disappear. Tonight. You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again. I am a nice guy, Daniel. With a job to do. You know how it is. 'Fraid so. The crowd had to dig it. Remember what you played? Unbelievable... ...you hearing this? Unbelievable. Get outta here! You and Louis? No. You heard Armstrong play live. I've never been this jealous. You get to talk to him? Was it great? Better than great, it had to be... Jesus... You're kidding me. Of course! I'm in town for a short time. Vincent... Quite an achievement... I'm sure you're very proud of Max. Client? I like to think of myself as more of a friend. A mentor. Tell me about it. It's nothing. I was with Max when he got the call. Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke. No harm done, ma'am. Hang on. Carefully... We're gay lovers, what's it to you? Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney... You hassling my driver again? Jesus, what is with this guy? Tell it to Max. Tell him he's an asshole. How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick? Vincent Farrell , Assistant U.S. Attorney. A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV... He's not paying you one cent! What happens if you don't? Max? Well. That was brilliant. Slow down! Slow the hell down! You're going too fast. Slow down. ...pie in the sky? "Someday my dream'll come..." But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old. It hasn't happened. It never will. Life just flipped on you. Tomorrow became yesterday. Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life... Don't talk to me about murder. You're do-in ' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday... Look in the mirror. ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros. How much you got saved? ...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision... As in...? Get with it. Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us. Lost in space. The universe doesn't care. The cop, you, me? Who notices? ...indifferent. That's the "why." That's the why? There is no reason. No good reason; no bad reason. To live or to die. How do I know? But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me. Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted... I dunno. And you believe me...? I'm full of shit? You're a monument of bullshit. You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage. Bad guys killing bad guys... You're too good. We're in this together. Fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence and all that crap... There you go...! How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four. Head towards Union Station. It's what I do for a living. Yeah, that. I shoulda saved him 'cause he believed you? Who's Heller? Good. Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing. Or remember we all die anyway... It's not what you owe me. Time is so fleeting. One day it's gone. You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her. That's what I think. What holds you back, Max? Tell me. Why does life scare you so much? Your lady friend. The one who gave you her business card. Think she was just being polite? Would you have called her? You do impress me, Max. That you do. Washington and Holt. Dance club called "Fever." Know it? Damn, Max. I'm impressed. Really. I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there. You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off. Quit stalling and get out of the cab. No. Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin." Why? We've both run out of options. If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice. That's jazz, my friend. You said it yourself. So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes. Max. You threw my briefcase in the river. You've got balls bigger than Toledo. When he finds out you tossed his list? I would. No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way. Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it. You're gonna be me. You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits. The man who hired me for this contract. Our friends in Little Russia. Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri. I'll just hold onto it for you. In case they check. Gimme your wallet. Good excuse. How many others you got? What, no insurance? Well, this big stake's got to be big by now. When you leaving? Yeah? Like what? Limos? What do you call it? Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me. I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do. Don't be. I never saw him after I was 15. Went into the military early. So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit. I killed him. When I was 15. He was my first. Nah, wishful thinking. Liver cancer. He hated everything I did. Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily... It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you... I had a father like that. Maybe so. Maybe she hears what you tell her. Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother. Limos, huh? What the fuck was that? You take one more step, I'll kill her. Oh, I'm captivated. Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention. That's bad. And that's not good... You go every night? Show up for what? Show up for what? Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop. I'm not playing. Pull your head out of your ass. Get your thinking straight. You wanna die? Don't even think you're walking away from me. Max? What are you doing? What you mean, no? Let's go. Jazz? That's funny, coming from you. Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this? I'll ask a question. You mind? I'm working here. That's the point. You play between the notes, you dance around the structure, you improvise. Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now. Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over. That's not living. That's dying a little every day. Not me, pal. It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living. That's jazz. That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about. Hell, it's the same thing he's talking about, if you just open your ears. You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet... Damn right. Instinct, man. If you think too much, it doesn't work. Just listen... God, are you always this prosaic? You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're taught. It's like breathing, like life. Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow. ...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening. Awesome. What do you think? Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central. Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop. Bird. Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk. Chet Baker. I'll buy you a drink. Expand your horizons... Jazz. Music. But, hey, some good news. This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill. Jazz? You like jazz? Yes, Max? People in the wrong place at the wrong time. Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work. And for you? You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be. Collateral damage. Another collateral. I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes. Where's the button? Under the dash? Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass. No you don't. So what? Don't take that. Tell him to shut the fuck up. It was an accident. You're not liable. Tell him. Who's that? Because I have a gun and I say so. Hands on the wheel. Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed. That one's probably married. Think of his kids. His wife's pregnant... Good luck. You think they got families? Believe it. Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space. You're a cabby. Like talk yourself out of a ticket? Get rid of 'em. Yeah, like that... But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive. Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat. Everybody dies. You don't know the guy in the trunk, either. If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise. Tens of thousands killed before sundown. Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Did you bat an eye, Max? Join Amnesty International? No. I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit... What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda? I should only kill people after I get to know 'em? Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy? Nothing. I only met him the one time. I didn't throw him, he fell. Chopin prelude. Stodgy, but nice. Here's the deal. I didn't want you involved in this. Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max. Improvise. Life is that way. Adapt to your environment. Survive. Darwin. "Shit happens." The I Ching. Whatever. Roll with it. Play music. What else calms you down? Candy? Cigarettes? Sex? Breathe. Are you breathing? Tonight it is. They're somebody's friends... You drive a cab. I kill people. We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead. I told you we had other stops to make tonight. How long, you figure? 58th and Central. You know it? So? What are you doing? You better? Adrenaline's wearing off. You get shaky after. It's not uncommon. Deep breathing helps. Try some deep breathing. I'm making you nervous. I'm the one with a schedule. How about the thingy next to it? What about that? Two... Try harder. I'm gonna count to three. One... You listening to me? Max. Max. May we leave the scene of the crime now, please. ...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right? Get in the fucking car. It's a spasm! Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl... What? Got it? It's just a dead guy. On three, ready? Uno. Dos. Three. I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs... Did I stutter? The trunk. Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go... You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX. Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator. So we go to Plan B. Pop the trunk. Good. Help me out here. No. You say you're cool. You cool, Max? Say "I'm cool." No-no, I-I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him. No shit. Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head... You always stutter? Max? I'm Vincent. We have a deal. What's your name? I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time. Regulations? These guys don't even give you sick leave. How much you pull down on a good night? Bullshit. You probably know the light schedules, too. Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing. Five stops, one night. I gotta catch a six a.m. flight. I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures. Why don't you hang with me? Twenty-four minutes! Man, you're hot... None taken. There are talkers and doers. I like doers. Like what? Oh? How long you been doing this? Why not? You should start a union. Yeah. Retirement? Paid sick leave? You on some kind of work plan? You prefer nights? You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in. This your regular ride? You share it with over three million people every day. You know that's the population of New Zealand? What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles. Read about this one guy. Gets on the subway and dies. Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that. Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million. That's too damn many people. Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown. Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave. Place gets to me. Too loud, too fast...too much. You like it here? Mind if I time you? What do I get if you're wrong? A free ride? Twenty-four? Not twenty-five? Or twenty-three? How long you think this'll take? Uh, let's go to... Hello...? Hello?
