He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now. You'll have to hurry. Save it for Bourne. What do you mean? Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push. She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account... No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse. I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak. You told me Bourne was dead. Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is. In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are. Had to be done. Why not? It was just money. I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry. I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry. Sit down. Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them... Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for? No... It must have been Bourne. Oh, God... It must have been Bourne. What? I wasn't sleeping. You OK? It's hard to swallow. The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick. What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear... There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her? You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection? My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him. Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers? You don't know what you're getting into here. Berlin! So what's your theory? Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name? The man is dead. Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln. This is supposed to be definitive? We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark. Do you know what his budget was? Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows? I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too. It had to be done. What happened? Jason Bourne happened. You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left. What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it? To know about it? It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here. You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing. And what are we looking for? With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade. Never heard of it. Show me again... Who else knows about this? Lots of people... Keep going... Jesus... It was staged? And? What do you have, Danny? She say what time I should call? Thanks.I'm sorry. I have to go now. No. Because you don't want to know how it feels. I can't let you do that either. Look at me. You know I'm not. It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough. I don't want you to forgive me. They loved you. And I killed them. It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere... I had to change my plan. You understand me? You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that. I killed them. That's not what happened to your parents. It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it? I would want to know. I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself. No. It's because you don't know how they died. It's nice. Does this picture mean anything to you? Hmm? Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer. That's why I came here. Sit. Can you... [The chair. Have the chair.] -- what? -- -- car keys? How long? How long do I have -- You called it in? I did. What's going on in Berlin? Pamela Landy? Who sent you to Greece? You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me? Try again. Conklin. She wouldn't let me. She's the only reason you're alive. You still should've moved. Front. Use your teeth. Drop it. I emptied it. God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you. I only dream about people who are dead. I know it's a dream. It might have. I did. I wanted to kill him. Tell me later. There's no choice. I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone. If he crosses the bridge, it is. I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow. You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour. -- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready -- -- not yet -- -- make the left -- toward the bridge -- Switch! You drive! You drive. -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong! Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't -- We can't wait to be sure. Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver -- No. Not this. This is real. And he's right there... It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent? He was at the campground yesterday. We pushed it. We got lazy. The Telegraph office. But it ends up the same. I should be better by now. It's just a nightmare. I'm trying, Marie, Okay? I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you. -- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway! You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that? Two years we're scribbling in a notebook -- No. There's nothing new. Conklin up front. I was here! That's a lie! My first job. For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When? So when was I here? Abbott? Why are you here, then? What was Landy buying? What kind of files? WHAT WAS SHE BUYING? I left a fingerprint! You fucking people. I killed him??? Last week? When? A Russian? Say it. I want to hear it from you. How do they know that? How can they know any of that? Why is she trying to kill me? IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE? Who is Pamela Landy? Get on it. See that tram coming around the corner? You didn't answer my question. Don't need it. I remember everything. What's that? Why am I alive? Oh, shit... Where am I? Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone. There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication. I want someone I know to take me in. I want to come in. It's me.Hold on... Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room... You're sure? But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow. What? Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night? -- go -- take the van! -- -- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links -- There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago -- Looks like he's been detained. -- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint... That's from the one that didn't go off. I'm working on it.-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! -- Is there. Is all there. Now. Show now. Show me.-- take the back -- get another car -- -- my coat -- but we should -- I'm sorry. She really did that? Told you not to kill me? I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are... I don't know! Why would I lie? I don't know who that is. A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new. I don't know. Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out. He's dead. What do you want? So why didn't you kill me then? I like it here. Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot. Sorry. Old habits. Felt a little light.Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling? Still... It's a lot of money, Pam. I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?Yes. In that order. We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed. His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. Here's what I've got. Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered. Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt. He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but... No. Munich's a bust. He's loose. Yup... The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.-- shut up! -- just shut the -- -- who? -- who else is here? -- This is everything? Is there. Here?Okay... Nobody. You. I had to tell you, right? Including Landy... She had access to the archives. Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin? Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this? Is it a slam dunk? No, but... There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here... First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this. Bourne would know. You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it. I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there. The sooner the better. Sir...
