Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been. I'm not... easy. Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address. My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking? Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want? So you are going to talk me to death. Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death? It's not worth it. Be with them instead. I don't know shit about you. What do you want? It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right? Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere. Am I a suspect? No. What am I doing here? [It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.] [I have a friend there.] [I'm on to Juarez.] [South America.] Where? I show, you give me the information? You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you. Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos. Give me the address. Where does he live? What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos? I'll call you tomorrow. I need something. Do you have banking connections? Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks. I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches. Maybe I can help your situation and you mine. It's a little late. I guess that makes you the smart one. [What is his name?] [So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.] [Daniel what?] [What is his name?] [How do you contact 'the Boss'?] [Reina Rosas.] [Who's Tazinari?] [What money?] [Who's the boss?] [Don't lie to me.] [Who killed her? You?] [The number you use at the bank machine.] [What's the PIN number?] [Who pays you?] [How does it work?] [Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.] [Not for a long time, sister.] [So am I, Sister.] [Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.] [In the next hour, where do I find your partner?] [How do I recognize him.] Who's he? [Who's he?] [Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.] [I believe you.] [Where do I find him?] [Who ordered it?] [Ordered by who?] [The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?] [Who are you?] [You are Jorge Ramirez.] [Drive.] [You're a liar. Pinta's dead.] [What do you mean?] [Yeah. Yes.] [Your brother wants to talk to you.] [I want you.] [I told you, non-negotiable.] [It's non-negotiable.] [I want you.] [Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.] [That's what everybody keeps saying.] [Who gave the bags to Ramos?] [Maybe your men stole from you.] [Don't lie to me!] [The ransom was ten.] [O.K. So tell me more.] [You stole the drop.] [And?] [Lucky how?] [It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.] [And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.] I'll probably kill them. Is that likely? My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay. I drink. It's loaded. Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226. Yes. Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth. Rocket launchers? I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32. Yes or no? Stomach's gone. But... okay. Pinta... Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan? Sorry I woke you, Ray. Maybe... I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer. There's still ink on my fingers from last week. Oh, now you think I can be trusted. A bodyguard... Who's the guy? I came to visit you. A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that. And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt? You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk? Everything happens once if you live long enough. Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse. Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting. And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable. Yeah, right... But don't you stay in El Paso? So how's business? Nothing wrong. It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane. Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught. I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it. I'm here. When did Mexican Customs start getting smart? You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours. Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13. Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic. Be a swimmer. Then be trained. Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that. That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride. Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time. Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough. Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears. Still not a question. That's not a question. Could I stop you? The blocks. Your father has business. There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained. You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound. The gunshot holds no fear. Say it. I know you're not. I dropped her at home. I'm sorry. Yeah. Two or three. No. I guess that really does make me a hard case. Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you. Remember you asked me what state I was from? Don't worry. You will. You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself. No, that was in Columbia. I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history. You feel sorry for the husband? In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules. Well, it's a sort of wife. Why do you ask? You need to practice. In a week you should be fine. How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it? Did you sleep alright? I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name? Do you always sleep with him? White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now. I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else? Where? They'll be back in a week. Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy. Well, I let him go. No. Do you think he'll come back? What are you doing? You're fast. Pinta, do you have a pencil? And don't start crying. Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it. It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna. No. No. That's right. Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun. Time will tell. I'm a bargain. Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking? Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking. I'm looking for potential. No. No. The United States. Creasy. Just call me Creasy. Who's Emilio? Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.] If they like me. Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back. Then don't come. I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes. An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity. They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus. Because... I was already dead. If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier. Sorry. It is serious, Mrs. Ramos. Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable. You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right? No. We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy. The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat. I'm fine. Never. So are you. It's war. The weakest suffer the most.What was her name? Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe? It's Creasy.[Senor?] [Why?] [Where are you staying in Mexico?] [Where are you coming from?][I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.] [The girl's. Pinta's.] [Her life for your life.] [Listen! I will give you a life for a life.] [This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --] [The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?] [Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?] [How much do you want?] [Mr. Creasy. What do you want?][Head of the anti-kidnapping division.] [The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.] [We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...] [The boss did or his brother.] [No!] [Four-seven-four-seven.] [The what?] [We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.] [Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]She understands men. Her beauty fucks with your mind. For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school. You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand? I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder. All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance. Yeah? And if she was ugly? If she pisses you off, you get another one. The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later. His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass. [He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.] [I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.] [The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.] [Yes.][One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.] [He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.] [I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.] I don't know, but I know his face. [The one who transferred Pinta to their car.] [He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.] [I'm professional. I just do my job.] [I don't know, I swear.] [I don't know. No one knows.] [The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.] [I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!] [I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.] [I am the President of La Hermanidad.] [Do you know who I am?] [Do you know who I am?]Creasy... I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances. You have no interest in making things easy, do you? No, but I have to admit I thought about it. I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing. You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be. The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want. My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works. It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours. My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats. He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil. The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that? The last few days may represent the best police work of my life. Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission. Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico. Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you. All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood. No. It would be convenient, but no. You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long. Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can. This page? [He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.] [I should start going for your tits first.] [A beautiful circle.] [You only fuck me to get information.] [I think he's... magnificent.] [When you talked to him, did he look sane?] [Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.] [It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.] [I know this. Your point?] [We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.] [He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.] [Is that good or bad?] And they took that away. What was she to Creasy then? I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that. This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does. What happened to him? What happened to Creasy? You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders. You two were a married couple. Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better. You helped him get this job. I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together. Tell me about your friend Creasy. Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really. So am I. I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.Different door. Not far from here. I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us. I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours. Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed. I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital. Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom. You got three of the fuckers. All dead. I said the plan was right here. Creasy? I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off. You mean a misfire? You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials. Oh you know that? Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not. Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust. Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit. What are you doing here? So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that. It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good. You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles. Well, you'd have to keep it under control. Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part. You did something on impulse? How long you staying, Crease? You been working? Oh, like you haven't been in worse places. Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here. Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne. Don't give me that bullshit. So what's wrong? This is Mexico, they do everything backwards. Everything happens once if you live long enough. You got a secondary search and you had a gun. What do you mean, I'm here? Creasy??? Where the fuck are you? A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece. Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again. Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead. He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way. None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say. The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends. I can take care of myself. That's what friends do. Two tourists who never went home. You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say. I already ate. He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him. He's not a cop killer.No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife. And what if amateurs try it? How does it affect you? Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch? Is it loaded? Have you used this type before? What is it? Show me, please. Were you provided with a gun? For an American she understands this country very well. And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard. For a year? I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him! I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it. Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day. Do you know what she told me last night? And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included. I wasn't thinking of Pinta. It will be a hard break. I've just been so busy, Lisa. That's ridiculous. Why? You were so pleased with him. What? Who? Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there. Hmm? I think it's fantastic. He has experience in related work. A great deal of it. My wife, Mr. Creasy. These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt. Our daughter. And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.] [No. Why?] [The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.] [OK, repeat the drop instructions.] [You have the money.]
