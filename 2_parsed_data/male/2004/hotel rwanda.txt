A delegation. Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office. They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate. Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception? Paul, Paul, a moment please.Paul... ...I have to talk to you. Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times? The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish? That's what I came to talk to you about. Cockroaches? Paul!You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju. You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N. Give me it. And four children? How many in your family? Ten thousand francs for each one. How much? You want to pay me? There is nothing to it. They are all Tutsi cockroaches. Where is your family? Do you know how to open the safe there? Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it. You work at the Hotel Diplomat? You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president. Let me see your identity card. We are looking for you. Who are you?We're awaiting a decision, excuse me. Yes we have. Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order. Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role. No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels. I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out. No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now. Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it. The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners. I can't, I don't have the men. That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel. Yes. Where are the Rwandan police? They're only taking the whites. You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African! They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people. Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing. We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless. Congratulations. You should spit in my face. Anything. Strong. They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister. Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them. Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room. Get him a room, but tell no one he is here. Paul will look after you. Paul, you know who this is?You will tell them the truth. I led no massacres. I committed no war crimes. You lie. I am on a list! What list? How so. We are better here. You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me. I am going to do you a great favor. I am going to take you with us to Gitarama. Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them. Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think? Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland? You know what the Scottish call it? Today. We have decided to move the government to Gitarama. They can go where they want. They are in charge now. After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back. Get in. I'll be over. Whiskey? You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey? Where are my supplies? You said you had no whiskey. I am strong, Paul, like a lion. I will see what I can do. If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them? He did. The police are very busy. The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders �we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.� What do you think would have happened? No different. The high command? Our high command? And what will they do with these satellites? Satellites? Watch everything? How? They are gone. What did they say? What did you overhear? The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you. Your cellar is well-stocked, right? As long as it is scotch. Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul. Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please. Paul, this scotch is exceptional.Take the river road back. It is clear. Why not? We are half way there already. Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead. No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul. Beer yes, but no whiskey. Everything is double the price now, you do understand that? A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar. I am always glad to see you Paul. Business is good at the hotel? Politics is power, Paul. And money.I saw the sign. The fog is too heavy, sir. Where are we going, sir? Please, except my humblest apologies... Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it. I don't have to listen to you anymore. Mr. Manager. There are no more rooms.Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'? Here, have a sandwich. You fucking see that! Holy shit! Holy shit. Satellite feed. Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon? For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it. Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane. I know that, Paul. I'm sorry. Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul. Perfect timing. Can we phone them in, Paul? Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know? Good for you. We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but... They moved you from the Diplomat? Paul, how the hell are ya'?I will remember that name. Let's go. Don't lie to me. What's your name? Who did you call? You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now. Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there. Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this? It's an order. Get everyone out now. Everyone must leave the hotel now. You are the manager?Show us the manager. He wears a suit. One thousand francs. No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards? What cards? What? Show me your ID The commander is not here. What do you want?Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go. No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead. It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches. No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe. I will see what I can do. No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this. Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.We, who is we? What happened? I'm sorry, it's a private function. Yes, Benedict, what can I do? I'll be back. Of course. Leave it to me. Excuse me? No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis. Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand? Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me. Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here. I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside. I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you. I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them. Ten. Six. Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines. I don't have that much. Name a price. Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work? Please, I don't use guns. Let me explain. Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here. Of course. I used to work at the Diplomat. No. I work at the Mille Collines. Yes, it is a calamity for us all. What is this about? I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu. Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise. I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day? What is it? Will you protect us. I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away. They fired a rocket at us. Their people? I don't understand. Excuse me, Colonel. Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all. Canadian Club? Where is she? What's happening? Yes sir, but these people they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium? Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance. I will do nothing unless you help me now. You think they will believe you? Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres. If you do not help me, you will stay on that list. When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists. The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list. You are a marked man. Listen, you need me. I do not want to go to Gitarama, General. Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate. I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now? No, sir. No. When? What do you mean, General? Where are they going? Your police are at the gate? We must go to the Diplomat. Bring back your policemen... The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you. General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies. No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests. I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty. Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio. Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey. I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one. I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness? The front gate would be best, General. �Well rewarded� Those were his words. I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded. I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us. Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily. 'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said. I thought I'd better tell you. The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command. Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder. Satellites. The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything. A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel. Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about. The United Nations are still here. I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie. It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know. Let's go. ) You cannot kill them all. What do you mean George? You have no whiskey? I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey. At least. Very good. Time is money, George. We need extra beer today. I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics. Thank God. When will they be here? Of course. The fifth room is your broadcast room. Just give me a moment to get your keys. Are you sure this is the river road? Just drive, Gregoire. For supplies, you drive. Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George? Gregoire it is good to see you back to work. I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you. Get out of this room and get back to work. Gregoire, what are you doing here? Give me the phone. This is a Rolex, I can't take it. I would never do that. This goes out live? I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish. I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here. Promoted. House Manager. I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish. Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina. Call, sir? That will take time. The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president. I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping. Why sir? Yes, sir. What is wrong? They have him in the lobby, go quickly. How much? You have our cards. Our cards, please. Excuse me. He will be here. We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda. I will give you my house. How do you know? I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins. Was there blood? This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful. I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family. I need a great favor. We can't wait. We all go together or not at all. They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance. Also, this is your bill for the last week. Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms. I'm going to put you on the third floor. I'm afraid you will have to move room. Of course. Anais, it is so good to see you. I have to go to the Diplomat. The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled. We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump. Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there. We have to have a plan. We are almost out of everything. I love you. Keep the children safe. I will follow on the next plane. Go. I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins. I have to stay. Get on the truck, Tatiana. We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children. I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise. We have to get out of here Tatiana. A Volkswagen. What does it matter. A car. It was substantial. To be closer. So that I could marry you. I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali. I had you transferred to Kigali. Yes, when you worked as the nurse. I have a confession. When we met... A kiss. It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace. I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now. I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide. To Rutagunda's place. It is close by. I have to go out to get food. We're running out of beer and other supplies. Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it. Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef. Do as I say. I will be there soon. Go to the roof now. Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then. What are you saying, Tatsi? I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis. Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers. We have been abandoned. They are being evacuated. No. They are not dead. Stop this. This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope. Give him time. How can we help him. Has Roger spoken yet? I'll try. Any luck? This won't do. Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them. What! Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore. Get in. Stay with the children. Where are you hurt, son? Dawn. Then they go. They know you are Tutsi! Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them? Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here? I sent them home. Go and call them. Murdered! By whom? Jean Baptiste! Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment. He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us? No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals? I couldn't help. No. Please, be quiet. What? Homework? Let's have dinner first. Thomas wants advice? Your brother's here? Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time? Why? Thank you, sir, you saved our lives. There is one thing I need right away. Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit. What is this about no water? When? Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people. You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here. How much beer? Where has all our beer gone? What are you doing? Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it. Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up. What! Paul storms off. Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire? How dead? Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself. Many times. Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates. It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama. You are with me, Zozo, don't worry. What's wrong? The French. They supply the Rwandan army. Yes, thank you Mr. President. Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left. The staff, the guests. I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all. We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel. Where? Who is this Simon? No, I don't want you going on the street. Why the hurry, Roger? Thank you, Roger. Go downstairs, I will help you. What is his room number? Can I help you?Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back. Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call? Paul, are you there? The staff and guests! How many? All. What do you mean all? Out? Where are you going? Paul. Are you alright?I don't know. I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room. Moses, Moses Seradungu.On the street. There are soldiers. Please, papa, I have a secret path. Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it? For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow. This time the Militia will kill us. Pack the bags, we have to move. The third floor are low class rooms. Move? Where to? I will need a suite.
