They were over here, Professor. Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any. The past, the future, whatever this object holds. I need to touch it to "see"... Oh, right -- Remind me why I keep doing this. Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs. Red. How long was it latched onto you? You were burned by some organic acid. No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal -- Red, I found something -- Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry. Liz left us, Red. Take the hint. Nothing psychic about it. You're easy. You mean, outside... with her. Story of my life.It doesn't say -- harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction -- -- Hound of resurrection? hound of resurrection -- Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --Cordon off the area. Something came through. If he's here, this is worse than I thought. Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society. I have seen ghosts, Whitman. "Paranormal" But -- you read the transmission. Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other -- I abhor violence. Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad -- Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point. In private, if you don't mind... Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word?? This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that. I think that is its hand. No. It was red. Bright red. Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs. In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated. Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin -- There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight -- No. It's not. I know where to find him. I'll get him back. He's just going through a phase -- Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner. I thought you liked being on TV. It's her choice -- She's human -- That's not how she feels. She may never feel it. Don't look! Turn around. Well, I won't be around forever, you know? I worry about you. Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before. Son. About Rasputin -- A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy. Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow -- A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite. And as a father, I worry about him. In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart... You're doing fine. Did he, now? 1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies. "In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers. We are the ones who bump back. Impressive. Do you remember what it said? As you entered the lobby there was an inscription -- Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe. "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here. The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien. They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there. At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead -- We're on the move. Try not to stare. He hates when people stare. It is. You got yourself on TV again. Well, you did break out -- Manning says I'm too soft on you -- The candy. Give him the candy. Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field. Agent Myers is your new liaison. Not so fast. He barely knows him -- His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in." Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens. He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised -- Okay. You saw the fish man, right? They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you. Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads." And crossroads I have become. Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key. She's dead. I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world. I alone know your true calling, your true name.Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind. Didn't even buy me a drink. I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow! I'm lucky that way. Nah -- he's taken care of. Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed. Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out -- Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works. We don't take hints. How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck Don't get psychic with me. I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding. Outside. I could be outside -- Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us. Skip to the end, willya? How do I kill it -- ? See? I don't like that -- That's all for you, Sammy. Oh, as opposed to -- ? How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here! Is it bad? Oh, stop that -- Damn! Be careful, there -- Me?? C'mon -- How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!! Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough -- Reliquary -- Who wards off demons. This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me? Her. Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions. C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk! Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song. "Myers", huh? You have a first name?? I wanted to see her. It's nobody's business. I don't want him. Got tired of me? Who's the squirt? I can live with that. Anung-un-Rama... Noooo! Noooo!!! Don't tell me, it's Zeppo. That voice -- My job. Yup. You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you. No. Don't -- Don't move. We -- I won't take 'em. They never work. Those things never work. Never. "One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs. I wish I could be more gracious but -- What are you trying to say? No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I? I knew those men better than you did -- How big can it be? Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there. On a scale of one to ten: two. But -- -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one. Good night. Not from you. Not hungry. Nah, sounds too "needy." Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" -- Shh! Just a second. What was that?? What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise? Hey. You: think twice -- Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out -- Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head -- That's right, Stud, hold me down. Could've fooled me. Go away. What are you, a Boy Scout? What took you so long? Goodbye. Myers? No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break. I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up. Myers??? How's your arm? No one ever helps me. It's my job. Whatcha looking at, John?? Father's back? Still angry? Those comics -- They never got the eyes right. ...Polo. Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything... Good. Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this -- But I can't. I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever. But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there -- Hi. It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished -- You're going alone? Out? Out out? Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear. Goodnight, then. We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me -- Come back, Liz. Come back. I -- Just a scratch. I wanted to see you.Two steps back, please. -- Section fifty-one. Step back. -- Late. Five minutes late.Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights? Is he serious?? See what?? These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo. Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded. I do. How many escapes? This year alone: five! Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor. Thank you. You never, ever light a cigar that way. You call that thing a cigar?? I'm in charge. We go back! -- should go back. Now! We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart -- Each of us gets a belt. We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use... When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades. In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you. That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight. You know monsters. Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then. But not everyone was so lucky. Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.It's got a big stone -- in its hand -- What the hell was that? An ape? That makes him more than a hundred -- C'mon -- Rasputin?? Grigory -- That's Russian, right? Thought they were on our side... Do you believe in hell? It's almost over!!Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart." I'm in way over my head, I know that much. 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45. "In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..." On the desk, yes. In Latin. Where am I -- exactly, Sir? How does he know so much about me? Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865. Sir, may I go first?? His what??!! Uh-oh -- John. Staring at what? Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real -- Who?! Grounded? Who's grounded? Alone? Are you sure about this? Well good n- Anything else you -- Hey, your chili's getting cold -- Start in, you got nachos coming. "Need" is a good, solid word. Where do you -- Hostage negotiations. I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back. Professor, that girl you were talking about -- Down there. Did you ever loose track of him? You want me to hold him down? No. I never was. C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up. Yes? No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are -- Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you -- My arm is fine. Where are you?? Helping you -- I just -- Oh-n-no -- I -- Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you. You're kidding -- What? That you feel that way about me. But it's not true, is it? It's freezing, isn't it? What about you? He -- loves you. My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects. Strong. No... He's determined. Unstoppable -- I admire him. He's a force of nature. Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice. Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks. It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John. Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name -- Pardon? Yes, I -- Hello, I'm --From where??!! Air and sea backup. What's closest? The freak in the gas mask -- Oh, I'll bet you have. Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories! What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal -- You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks. Three days too late for that one, "professor." Here. You'll need one of these. You are a Catholic?? What is it? Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
