You hear talk  these days, and I know you've heard  this talk, you hear talk of DECLINE,  well all that means is we done turned  our back on God! ...People say civilization doin'  this, civilization doin' that,  civilization in DECLINE! Well it  ain't no civilization! It ain't no  them! It's US, brothers and sisters! ...It's what's in our hearts, each  and every one of us when we like  them Israelites! Slidin' awa-a-a-ay  down that Godly slope, slippin' and  slidin' toward the mire and muck a  the stinkhole of greed -- that's ...And what did Moses do when he saw  those declinin' backslidin' never- mindin' sinners? ...Moses SMOTE those sinners in his  wrath yes he did! ...Y'all know what smote is! I smite!  You smite! He smites! We done smote! ...To smite is to go UPSIDE the head! ...Because sometimes, brothers and  sisters, that is the ONLY way! ...To smite is to reMIND! We got to  STOP that decline! And scramble back  UP to the face a the almighty Gyod! ...'Stead a worshippin' that GOLDEN  calf, that earthly TRASH on that  GARBAGE island! That GARBAGE island  in that shadowland WAY outside the  Kingdom a God! ...That GARBAGE island where scavenger  birds feast on the bones a the  backslidin' damned! ...And so, let us pray...

But my point is it ain't gonna  happen again. Not if it's humanly  possible... Hmm... But Jesus, if you'd seen the ass on  that girl, Mr. Gudge, you'd a wanted  her sitting on your face too.
