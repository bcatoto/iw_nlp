Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco! Weirder than this? You need to see the prison shrink, man. Shit. I knew you were crazy. Straight up. Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else. Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions. Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago. Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit! It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex. You'd be surprised how often they are. Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad. If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related. Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now. Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors... It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days. A journal. Just have him write down everything he does. Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory. Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out. And you say he doesn't remember any of it? You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one. Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia... Books? Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour. This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex. It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before. The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car. Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe. Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now? Are you hurting her? Where are you now? Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand? Not in this wing, actually. No. Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you. He's as handsome as his father.Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here. You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you. Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts. I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it. There must be a way to fix this. He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc? Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got? Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all! How's Kayleigh doing? She all right? How long will I be in here? What? What could he do? Sure... No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten. Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time? Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades? Please, mom. People will talk. I... I blacked out. I don't know... I don't remember. Okay. I... I don't remember. What happened? These'll bring you luck, Crockett. My father has a bad memory, too? I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures! No. All the dads are gonna be there. But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad... Can't he come out for one day? Um... can dad come this time? Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy. We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night. We're gonna be late again. So you believe me? What did you see? What did it look like? Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess. Just tell me if anything weird happens. So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely. I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams. Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me. You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?" Can you protect me? Photos? But I... I need those books. My journals! Where are they? Where are my goddamn books? Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored? Are you sure? Not even with my father? It's coming... argh! I can't! I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods. I see a car. No, protecting her. I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears. Yes. Dad lives here? You know my father? Get out. Both of you. Huh? What? Shhh! I need quiet for this. I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off -- All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories. Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories. It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever. This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts. Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday. Then you think it might have worked out? And...? I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together? I don't get it. I was? Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us? Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something. He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck. Stop! Take me back! Where are we going? I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit. Don't think I'll need it where I'm going. Which is? That I didn't leave you there to rot. I just thought you should know. Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister. Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh? I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you. I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again. Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts? Yeah? Different? How? Why's that? You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying. The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack. No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been. I get it. You can drop it now. Nice to see you, too. Can I come in? Now's the only time! Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa -- I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby -- He's a fucking maniac! What? I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us. I walk differently? Like how? What do you mean? Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine. Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett. Might'a been nice. Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun. Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. Go on. Sit down. You'll see. What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away? So it didn't feel... weird? I dunno. Just being weird. Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera? Where... where are my clothes? Jesus, Kayleigh, you're... Incredible. You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak. No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us. I know, but... It's just... did he... what happened in the basement? When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something? Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help. Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts? Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you. Couldn't you have moved in with your mom? Wow. That must've taken some courage. So how's Tommy? Not since we were kids. I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good... Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know... Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change. He must be. They're letting him go, right? Duck, here they come. I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right? What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit. Damn. Your dad did this? I'm sorry. I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea. Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help! So let's go. This place creeps me out. Been there, done that. And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass! Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you. Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa? It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy. Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood. What time is it? Kayleigh? What happened? I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here? Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go? We're really gonna be in a movie!? Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again. Who's to say you can't make things better? But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me. Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done. Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your -- Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers... You're kidding. Are these the answers?! We'll find out soon enough. Evan Treborn. I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension? I won't let you down, Professor Carter. Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't... Hey, I got no choice. I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts? It didn't feel like a dream. It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human. Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay? Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven. Thumper had a busy afternoon. Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain. If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh. Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it. Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor. My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see. Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh. Y... yes. I guess I did. Yeah, good, what else do you remember? That should buy you ten minutes at least. Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway. Mom. Don't cry. I can change this. Lung cancer? Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke. I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father. No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy. What the hell are you doing? Leave us alone you sick fuck! What's wrong with you?! What happened?? Where are we?! Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already? Hey, what'd you do that for? None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here? I come from a big family. Huh?I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it. Damn, Evan, on the D.L. Me neither. Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother. There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were. I was praying this curse would have ended with me. Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there. It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?Destroy it? What? What do you need it for? I don't get you lately. Are you sure you even packed it? Uh, we should be getting to class now. You knew the whole time, didn't you? When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?! Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep. I couldn't cut the rope. Gee, thanks friend. Can... can... Can I have this? Maybe it went out. Should someone check it? Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed. What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing. You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off! Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty. ...yes. Who -- who are you? What's happened to -- How are you doing that? It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you. Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been. Calm down, kid. Stand still. That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin. And you are...? Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due. Just don't drop the ball, okay? I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right? Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming. Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all. Fuck off, frat boy. Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex? Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit! Are you stupid or what? What the fuck are you doing? You really think he wanted to kill you? That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart. Like Ozzy. I thought you were a December baby.I think I'll go check out the chapel. Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately. I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance. Listen to me good, Evan... Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck." It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit. Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself. Look what you made me do! Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on! Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid. Fat little baby, crying for mommy. Aw, hey now, that was a compliment. Lenny? Come on! Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you? Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already. What did I say about mentioning that bitch? I thought I was the bad guy! I don't think Evan gets to be in it -- Yeah, you do that, Lenny. The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure. Here you go, buddy. You're such a retard!
