What do you mean? Ask me. Ask me anything. Sure. It's crazy out there. Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face? I know. I'm just saying I understand. I'm just talking, man. I get horny as hell for other women. I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman. Don't talk like that. You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man. The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her. It's not what you think. C'mon, Walter. Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet. Early July. Soon. Aren't you glad? Annette will see you. I've got some good news. Ah, come on. I've got some pictures. Want to see? Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty. She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White. What party? Fucking Mariners. What's happening? I know, man. I love this table too. But I also love my wife. She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it. It wasn't like that. You need a table. It was a beautiful present. Yeah. It's really nice. It's a nice table. Huh? This little table is one heavy bitch. She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come... I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect. Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now. I don't know. She won't talk about it. I'm working on it. Annette? She's good... tense. I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells. But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school. No way, man, you'd rob me blind! What? I was just thinking of... the noise. Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus. Hey, is that a school? I'll never forget you got me started there. Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys... Five years. Foreman now. Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious. You doing okay? You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now! Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.You sure you don't know nothing about this? Well, I guess I'll be seeing you. Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow. The passionate one? I'd say you're moving. What's with the boxes? That's a nasty scratch on your neck. Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head. He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well. I could take you downtown. The assault took place at approximately seven thirty. I didn't say what time the assault occurred. A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that? I'll be asking the questions. Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts? You don't know? What? That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch. Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half? Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive. The one with the ax? Neither do I. What's the one with the woodsman? Do you believe in them? This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door. Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it. You believe in fairy tales? You walked home. Don't be witty. Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter? Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships. Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun. Too much sun. Okay? Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a piece of shit. Think anyone would miss you if I threw you out the window right now? I could say you jumped when I came in. Who are they going to believe? Not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit. And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off? Who said I wanted to buy it? Unusual design for a contemporary piece. Cherry? I could get a search warrant. Got something to hide? Then you won't mind if I look around. I think you do. You don't know? Have a seat. Hiya, Walter.Sergeant Lucas. May I come in? But you are taking it? Are you taking your medication? And your new apartment? So. How are you adjusting?How do you feel about that? It's going to take time, Walter. Accept you? All right. A small house... with small rooms. When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house. I meant later... when you two took naps. Did you get an erection? You felt pleasure. What else? I'm only asking questions. Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes? Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there. All right. Did you and your sister often take naps together? A nap? And what are you doing? But roughly, how old? How old are you and your sister? Where are you? Where? Sorry. Where is she? Where is she? What is she doing? How old -- Who do you see? In your mind, Walter. Take your time. No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see? When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember? No, I am not going to -- Close your eyes and let your mind be blank. To relax. I'd like you to close your eyes. Close your eyes. That's not a helpful answer. If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes. When did it all start? I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person. Please don't do it again. You're very late. Go home, Walter. We'll talk about it more on Thursday. Walter, we'll pick up here next time. I want you to calm down. Is this the first one? What did you want to happen? What did you think would happen? I know you're frustrated, Walter, but -- I know -- Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal! Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you. Why don't we continue this on Thursday. What is your idea of being normal? They usually tell me. I don't. I suppose it's however society defines it. I'm afraid not. I couldn't say. We have a lot of work to do. We have a few more minutes. That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around. Is that what you are angry about? Why do you think you're here? Do you think you're crazy? Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns? What are you afraid will happen? Then why are you talking about this? You have no feelings for your niece? How do you feel about that? Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung. Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name. Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch? Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here? But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter. You don't like coming here, do you? I wish you'd give it a try. How's the journal? Then think about it. Try it. By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals. It's very good, indeed. That's right. I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect. It was just an idea. Oh. It never crossed my mind. I don't understand. Why not? That's right. I'd like you to keep a journal. Walter, I'd like you to try something for me. No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist. You seem a little hostile today. That's right, you did. Have you made any friends there? Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there? And how's your job?I mean... feelings. Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna? Nothing. Carlos, can I ask you something? Maybe because you're looking her in the face. Carlos, I never raped a woman. You don't have to tell me this. Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad. I'm not a monster. Isn't it? You should see my appointment book. It got crazy. Tell Annette I'm busy in July. Next week? The week after? When? What's that? I don't want to see any goddamn pictures. No thanks. The birthday party. Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal. How was the party? Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers. I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it. Then what? What?! She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood. Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?! It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world. Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs? It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood. Cherry. What are you doing? Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet. How old is Anna? You're the only one in the family who still talks to me. Is it because of Anna? When can I see her? How is she? You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood. Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet? One hundred and twenty feet. I like the noise. Something wrong with that? K through sixth. I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself. Beautiful. How's business? No shit. Yeah, you still with Northland? Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now. Seems like the whole world's gotten younger. I told her all my relatives are good- looking. Don't need to think fast to handle beer. You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine. It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors. Well... not in the common way. A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends. Don't you have friends? What are you writing in that book? Not yet. It's good to listen to your daddy. Do you come here often? Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly. Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher. You live around here? That was terrific. I'd love to hear it. I bet you can. Try. How does it sound? A solitary vireo. I like that one. It's just a city park. You always carry these? The mother sure has her hands full. Why not? Is that right? Sure. In that birch tree is a nest. Birds. 'Fraid not. I count my blessings. Yes. It's a free country, isn't it? You're a cop. Figure it out. I have a passionate girlfriend. I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill. You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though. I wasn't feeling well. I went to bed around seven. You said last night. I went to bed pretty early. I was asleep. No. Know what? The girl. You knew her? Little Red Riding Hood. I don't know. Woodsman? No. Fairy tales? Yes. I fell asleep. You going to take me on a nature walk? They grow outside, don't they? What? Okay. You can't talk to me like -- It's not for sale. Yeah. If you could, you would have brought one today. Doesn't everybody? I would. I haven't broken any laws. Why don't you just tell me? I have no idea. What's up? Cop. You are in. Yeah. It gives me headaches. Apartment's okay. I'm adjusting okay. It's getting dark. Go home. You should go home. No. Yes? Robin, listen to me. I know because... it's just something I know. Your daddy will always love you. Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like. You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you. Yes you can, Robin. Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does. What's her name? Do you like it when he asks you? Does he? They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark. I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there? That's okay... doesn't matter. Are you sure? Would you like to sit on my lap? Would you like to sit on my lap? Robin? Banished... yeah. A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone. No. Walter. No you're not. Can I ask how old you are? I feel... okay. Time. She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to... I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair. It was a small house. I was six years old! Yes. That's all. I just liked smelling her hair. Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up! I smelled her hair. This is garbage! Nothing. I don't like nobody behind my back! Don't ever do that again. I want you back in your chair! Right now! What the hell are you doing there? Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen? Just lying there. We're taking a nap. I'm maybe about six... which would make her four. We're little kids. In my bed too. In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think? In my bedroom, sleeping. Not so fast. I see my sister. I don't see -- Nothing. Can I open my eyes? Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen. Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me? I'm relaxed. Why? What? That's my answer. I don't know. You mean my problem? I said I was sorry. Sorry. Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away. That's my idea of being normal. Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was? I want to talk about it now. Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you! You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing. I don't know! I don't know. I don't know. You don't know! Fuck you, Rosen! I want to be normal! What is your idea of being a Jew? How do they know? Then how do you know if your patients are getting better? How do you define it? Do you know what "normal" is? You couldn't say. Will I ever be normal? I mean, when will I be normal. How long is this going to take? Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round. You know why. It's part of the parole deal. If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here? I'm not that crazy. I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer. Have to talk about something. She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings? I don't feel anything. I don't need someone else. Rosen? I don't have a problem with that. Forget it. Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch. Honest? No. It's okay. I'm still thinking about it. No fucking way. How's that? You think reflection is good. Reflect. Bad idea. Of course. Ev-i-dence. Diaries have sent too many guys to prison. No way. A diary? What? It's all the same. It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen. That was a joke. I'm not running for Mr. Popularity. I said the job is okay. The job's okay. I heard they were filthy birds. Yeah. I need a shower. I didn't sleep well. Nothing. Why's it always my fucking problem? Sneak up behind me like that. Don't do that. I'm not scared. Thank you. I don't need a plant. What's this? I say we call it quits. That's not what I meant. Most people don't have my kind of problems. I've got problems. I don't even know how to live with myself. It's a bad idea. Live together. Maybe you should be. I'm not scared. Us seeing each other. Maybe this isn't a good idea. Not ever? You never asked them about it? No you don't. You must hate your brothers. Which brother did this? Why not tell me now? For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me. The percentages -- Most people say the odds are against me. Being here, with me. You know, this is crazy. Nothing. It's over. No. That's what I used to tell myself. I was always the one seduced. Their power. They seduce me. I've changed. Sounds like a special guy. Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that. No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time. You don't really -- No. Never again. Depraved? My mistake. Get your kicks somewhere else. You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit? Why don't you just go now, okay? The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty. I never hurt them. Never. Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were. It's not what you think. Sorry. Look, you can go now. Twelve years in prison is no joke. Yeah. I molested little girls. Yeah. What's the worst thing you ever did? Why do you want to know? Hi. When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming. I suffer from insomnia. What for? The morning? Maybe later. It's been a while since... You think I have a problem? Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole! Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole. You're still here. So, you're not a dyke. What? Why do you want to know? I get that impression. Yeah? What? They could eat you. What about bears? You must hate it. I like the noise. K through sixth. Sorry. I'll buy a plant. What? Are you? I thought you were a dyke. Neither do you. I'm just quiet. Most women wouldn't choose it. No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard. People without cars. Me? What picture? I'm all right. Are you okay?
