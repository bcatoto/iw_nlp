Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite. In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to. Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two..... Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out. I mean it! No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done. She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong. You're a lucky man. She's in love with you. Anyone can see that. I know it's no good. I've no right to be jealous. Thing is...I think I'm in love with her. Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you. She is beautiful. I was wrong. She tried to help us get away. Now, you're too suspicious. Rene? About what? Keep thinking. Gimme a minute. Never mind that, where are we now. Be quiet. Losing power. The laser drained it. What exactly? Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip. This may hurt. And don't let her know, either. GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho. The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now. ...Shit! It's just money. Aim just in front of his face. Are you alright? Don't worry, I can. Do it. He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him. He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back. It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong. While he makes the run. It's not the one...Wait... there's a label. Left...The one with the red dot. Cash. haka xuki. You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman. Just say the words. Just like I told you. Not sure at all. I've got an idea. Plenty of circuits in a Walkman... It's him. I don't trust her. Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind. No. You can't trust her. He was with Gruner! Never mind, just say it. Neither can they. Door to the right. Get up and run. A hard left. A hard left. Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----. You have to! Quickly! Drink lots of water. ...drink it. Don't touch a thing. One of your instincts? Yeah...You've fallen for her. What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through. Relax. Make your mind a blank. Relax. Let me do this. `Joe. I'm here. You're Okay. Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me. Just stay here and rest. That's not funny. Come on, she's getting away. Run, stupid! Follow her. We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself. Fountainhead of High-Tech. Osaka. Better. I found Ryuji. Bingo. Some agent you are. You been had. We have. I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do! You get time off to sleep. And on my time. Shit! You're in love. Is that all? What she say. What'd you get out of her? What Happened? Joe! It's 56 hours! Oh come on. What am I supposed to do? What if she says something important? What is it? You're doing great with her. What is it, your charm? Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know. She's the toughest to read. Voice stress analyzer. They're all in it. Joe, be careful! Don't get too cute. He recognises you, throw him off. It lends you an air of mystery. Just don't show fear. The blond...GRUNER. A killer. Just hold them close and stay still. Follow that busboy. The drinks...Stay on them. Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses. Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved. You're not just after this girl, are you? Get close to them. They both look good to me. Which one is she? Doesn't. What did that cost? Not that tie with that coat. It is my business. It's my name. Much too blue. You really like that shirt? Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out! Is something glinting? But what's it look like? What are you looking at? But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire. Well you did it today. You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum. It worked. Good thing I'm here to do the thinking. Without your pants. Where are you going? What happened? No...you idiot! Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works. Touch her. Where is she staying? Wait. . Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth. Don't just stand there, say something. What can I do? You're on your own. How should I know? Try another language. What's happening? What is it? You're out of shape. Follow it. What was? What? What do you mean? Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while. For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it! Why not? Eat it. The sand. I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it. You eat it. Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head. Swim. Do you notice anything. What is it? Just get there. How else do you get seaweed under your nails? The beach. Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands. You'll be me. Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona. It's attitude...how you carry yourself. We'll change your appearance. Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy. You are in trouble. Now do it. Who cares? Why not? Use my credit cards. What about it? We get on a plane. You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities... Send a man there. A secret agent. Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique... Nothing. You just do nothing. Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up. Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound. Good. Get to a phone. I'm back. I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport. Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you? Anything...A feeling...a smell..? You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away. You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me. Don't know. They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone. That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them. What do you mean? Oh my God...What did he look like, the man? Who did? Is it familiar? Have you been here before. Take a left and your next right. What does it say. With Authority! Go out, take your first left. See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993 We have to get out of here. Sue them. They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece. I'm not gonna make it easy. Ever think of what they might have to do to find me? Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here. We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility. You gotta help. You're the one talking to a little guy in your head. ...We'll have to do it on our own. I am. You are. They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need." I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance. I don't know. I don't want to find out. It can't take that long. Did you hear that? No. Don't tell the guards. Calm Down! Act rational. You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help? Too late...They want you. Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer. Then what are you stopping for? Whatever you do, just...don't stop. Outrun them. What'd he look like? What's that? Behind us? Anyone there? If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward. I'll tell you what to say. I'll talk to them. No they won't. Why don't you? You weren't listening! What was that? Yeah. You'll be alive. Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down. Yeah. Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head? You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain. Of course you do! You're not crazy. Don't do it. Don't aim at the head. Are you crazy? What for? What are you doing? I know...it sounds insane. Then how'd I get here? You've heard of U.S.T.? The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either. Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that! Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it. I'm trying to get you to listen to reason. You've heard of the PEM114... I told you, my name is Al. Quit screwing around, this is important. Yeah...Who? Who are you? I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle. Right. No. Where are we now? Yeah? ...I need to make a phone call. Why don't we go home? What street? Where are we? I just got here. What is your name? Yes. Yes. Yes? Al. Me. It wasn't him. Don't do that. What's going on? I'm...inside you. You're not gonna believe this... My name is AL. No, not her. Me. I said something. You just got a Mickey. Some friend you are! You know what I hope? I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love. Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM. It's all we've got. GO-TOE. It's some islands. I knew you were trouble. Then what? What kind of a deal? In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you. I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this. Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this. Don't worry. I'm against it. We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter? Good. No! Don't give her your name. Do what? What'd you do? The best part. She'll love it. Doesn't matter. Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right. Sorry... Not that truth!They have stolen state property. It's a long story. Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him. No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was. Who's our little man? Impossible. Rene? We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM. ?!! You've cut your hair? You didn't tell us you were coming?It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility. Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs. Doesn't matter. Then put him away. He work for us? We'll have to let them go. You have nothing... Surveillance Cameras?I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside. Me. If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study. I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him. She found out what she could ...and delivered him here. I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap.. Enough ROmance. Yes? Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour. Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that. That crazy guy? What are you doing here, where've you been? Join us. Who is your friend? And...you know Jan Gruner? What brings you here? And how do you service foreigners. You remind me of someone. You from the west coast? That name's familiar. We insist.Bit expensive, sir. Sir? What Job? Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview. Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here. Surveilliance on them all. We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them? They took the tapes. Sue who? Was quite excited, when he came in... Been hearing voices. Been complaning of hallucinations. Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you. Al? Who? Why would we want to hurt you? Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you? Take the card. Joe. Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number. You'll feel better Why don't you lie down until you feel better. Don't you want to get out? Home. Your home. The address on your form. We're here. Well... Fine. You look fine. Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright? Right. Anything....You call us right away. You got that? When you remember... When you do... I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days. You may not remember things. It may have been affected. Your memory. Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.Just give me the keys. You may you find all the solitude you want. And you, there are many places to get away. Why here? I noticed you staring.What are you doing? That's nice. I'll get us out of here. Awwww... I want to thank you for what you've done. I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow. You're lovely. Yeah, sure. They can? Oh no! You've changed your mind. No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along. You were the one who was always suspicious of her! She works for them. Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here. I have been... I think you're right. I can always flush you down the toilet. Looks like you can have all you want. We are in a dungeon. How do we get out? Where've you been? What happened? I don't know. Do something. Pretty advanced, isn't it? Well, don't let it. What are you doing? There's a lot you don't know. Dieter! He aready made the deal.. Holy... Aim what? Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on. I can't handle that thing. Then, why'd he lead us here. And Dieter? Where? He hung us up dry. Well...? haka xuki. What's that mean? What was it? What'd I say? Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot. You sure this will work? I was afraid of that. Come on. Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got... Probably. I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000. You were with GRUNER! What? I can't see a thing. Ow! What are you doing? ...imagine a better grape for the region. I can't... What next! Too late. Don't worry! I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her. I told you, I have a feeling... You think. That's what you're good at. It is a blank. This is no time for Zen. What do I do? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone... Where are you going? Sapporo.. Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad. I can't keep up. On what? What do I do? I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........ Don't you think I stand out like this. Osaka? That's good. It's not better. Where? You found her. Why don't you get out of my face. It wasn't like that. No. What will you do. No. What do you hope? AL I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do? It's not your time. I get time off. She's got the most beautiful...s Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week. Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo.. I don't know! I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it. You shut down your sensors. You got any books in there? I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in. It's embarrassing. You can't listen. You can't watch either. Not her. You! This just won't work. Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct... Maybe she's telling the truth. Even Rene? Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time. How do you know? ...I've lost something. I must get it back. My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place. I don't know what's going on. Killer! Which one? I feel like an idiot. Are you serious? What glasses. That's a big if. You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know. Who, me? That place. By the window. You have no taste. The beautiful one. You want sophistication, it don't come cheap. Why not?! But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want. Mind your own business. Not blue enough. This...is not going to work out. What is it? What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing. Now, where would I be? Yeah. I did it. I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls. Rene... I made it work. Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her. Maybe they won't stand on ceremony. To the hotel. To register. ...Rene... ...Joe. What? Where are you staying? Wait. . What? What do I do? Help me out, will you? Which language? She doesn't seem to understand. You're beautiful.. She's beautiful...! What do I do? She's...pretty fast. This must be business, there's nothing else here. A girl. Beautiful! Are you screwing with any nerves? Al, are you doing anything in there? Where are you going? Wait! It's sand. I don't want to eat it. Eat it? Now what? You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like? Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what? Little late for that. Good Idea! The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now? ...Just beautiful. Holy shit! Eating sushi? The beach? Now what? You leave my glands alone! I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you? Oh yeah, to what? What's wrong with how I carry myself. It's just not enough. They'll know who I am. ...and a license to kill... I'll get in trouble. It's illegal. I can't do that. I don't have any. What about money? We get on which plane? You mean...just leave. Who?... Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone. What do we do? What is it? What am I supposed to do? Who is it? I'm at the airport. The airport! Hey, wait a minute. Just scratched my arm, why? Nothing! I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home. You need ID in there? Gone where? That's not a good idea. Black suits and helmets. Like the guys that attacked us. I can't remember.. The man. I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink. A lab and equipment. Where are we going? Corridor A. Which way do I go? Just walk down the hall? Now what. Door's locked. I don't like the sound of that. I'll sue. Why don't you just get out, leave me alone. Find You? I'm not leaving until you do. Thanks. I did. I brought you back here. What do you mean we. You are CRAZY! Yeah...Who is? Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you. They could put you back in the tube.. JOE Or what? Why? Yeah. Al wants to talk to you! I don't know...To get Al. How do you act when someone trys to kill you? I don't know anything. I just want to go home. Why? AL You know too much. I want out. Can't see a Goddamn thi.. I wouldn't say that. Now what? This is a Fiesta! What do I do? He's not the problem. It's the van in the back. Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us. Still clear. Just a motorcycle. No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up. If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head? Oh...Gooood! Why not? Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head. Why don't I just take you back to UST? Who was that? Somebody out there? With a man in my head... Why he's argumentative? You're gonna explain. Then I'm crazy. Hear voices don't I. Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too. Yep. Kill myself. Loading a gun. You said it. I just went there for a job. No. I don't know what you're talking about. Me? What'd I do? Are you threatening me? That a new Datsun? What are you doing in my head, Al? It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you? Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD! Who am I? Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are. Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say. You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything. My place, can't you see? Somebody's been here. Shut up! Do me a favor, Al. Go home. Good idea. Get some rest. What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves. Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us. What??? You lose your lease on a condo? You're in my head? You don't know my name? No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play... What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head. I see... Your name is Al... You're in my head... This candid camera? Al. Who? Who was it? Arrrgh! Why not. ...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!! Try me. Where are you,...Al? Al ???!!! Who's you? I know you did! How about a deal? Newer, more powerful design. PEM115! I dyed it. We're all getting old. Then how did you know? I think I've heard of you. I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all. Well...I try to give them whatever they want. ...Foreign service. It is to me too. Al Viola. I don't want to intrude. You...him...UST. Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon... Not...complaining, actually. Ahhh...nothing. I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head. The little man in my... ...head... I don't know Who. Not you. Them. No, it wasn't, It was intentional. Oh yeah, thanks... What? I will? I feel fine. Oh....Sure. Oh. Here? Well what? Thanks. How do I look? Who...are you? Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you Remember what? Do what? Oh...that's okay. What things? Oh. What about it? What? Whatever it is, don't do it. Don't do it! Thanks, I appreciate that. A little voice in my head. Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...? That Rene...lovely girl...a killer! The fresh tuna?.. About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood. Now you know what I know. This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card. How's that Trucklhouser Beer? How's that for fucking Savoir Fair! Oh...and who is it!? Then who did? What? What did you say? What do you want? Yes...What is it? Yeah...I have to get away. We're not moving fast enough for him. Riuji? Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats. Come on. It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now. He told me what to do. It wasn't me. It was him. Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this. He can't help us. We just don't stop. I knew it. I told him. Who are you? Who do you work for? Her? You son of a bitch! You conned me! I'll come back for you. Escape. Don't worry. Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you Now what? What? I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend. Why did you, then? I'm sorry I got you into this. They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us. Nothing we can do. What a mess. Why? Now what? What did you tell them? Looks like they can. What did they do? Are you alright? I can't fly it. Sure I can, can't I? Why not? Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him. So do I. You coming along? You've been there? ...across THE BORDER. Come on! I said just relax. I'm in full control. Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here. Why'd you ask him. Oh. Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here? What? If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from? Where would you go to sell a chip? Get us one. Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time. We figure out if it's in here. He plays it all the time. Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous. Beats me. And you? And Dieter. Who was? What's Gruner like? You think I'm like that? Then why are you smiling like that? You don't believe me. Get your things. What is it? Got to trust someone. The most important one. Can you help me find him? A chip. Goes in a computer. We're very close. He stole something. From a friend of mine. You know where he went? I'm just on vacation. I'm sorry. What will you do? Why? Food doesn't agree with me. This is a tough place to keep Kosher. Who did? He didn't. Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me? Were you working for him last night? You work for Ryuji? Why did they leave? What did you tell them? Your friends, did they ask about me? Who else is interested in me? Why? Why did you stay with me? Why didn't you tell me? Why did you leave? Why'd you run off? And you, what do you like? How often they come here? Hires you for what? Is that Ryuji? No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you? ...Naw. Made that up. Just Okay... And how'm I doing? That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to? If I was with you, I wouldn't But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy. I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask? Promise you what? You are. I am sort of scattered. Disinterest? It's not apparent. Why? Me still. They left you alone? And you? Yes, of course. Wait. What's your name? What way? What's so funny? Let you leave without it. I can't do that? ...right here too. Dinner...tonight. I'll be right there. Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard. The poet...something he said... ...Blake No. No one to speak of. ...I'm looking for someone. What about the others. Why'd you invite me here? Why are you on to him? Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it? ...Piece of mind. It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something. Thanks. A drink... I have a seat. I've had it since nine. Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you. Yes. That's alright. Just tear it apart. Could I have it, please. It will be fine. You have another. It's alright. Why not? Why? It doesn't hurt. It'l be alright. The other working. This the only spare? Thank you.RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here. JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back! JOE What abilities...? JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake? JOE Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!I don't know. Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off. We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off. I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you. Excuse me? What could you find in this place? Must be a fulfilling occupation.No? It will. Ow?... Perfectly. Yes. Right there. So we better get started. Whoever took it does. Too much. What'd he say, how's he know about Al? Poor bastard.Mom...what are you doing here? Ahhh...Okay?!!! Tear it apart? I can't get it out. It would take hours. Just one. The back up. It is? The experiment. The danger... You can't take that. Wait. What about Al... It'l take months. Look, nobody knows we did it. What does he know? Screw the PEM...What about Al...Yessir...very good sir. Ahhh. Good choice, sir. Sir? We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir. Sir?
