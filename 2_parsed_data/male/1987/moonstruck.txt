Three times they cancel the order  with me, and three times they come  back. Who they kidding? They cheap,  cheap, cheap. The other bread they  get is no good. They save pennies.  Everybody complain and they come  back. "Zito, your bread is the best."  They're like children stupid in school  who cannot learn. The water. It's  the water. You buy bread in Hoboken,  you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water  is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask  your father. He knows. You want me to make you some coffee? I am a genius. If you're such an artistic genius,  why can't you keep track of your  receipts? How am I going to do your  income tax? I am an artistic genius. Red roses. Very romantic. The man  who sends these knows what he's doing. I'm glad everybody ain't like you,  Loretta. I'd be outta business. Are you ready? Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight? Very good, Mr. Johnny. We will both have the Salad Ticino. Uh-huh And I'll have the special fish. No? Maybe you're right. Yes, Miss Loretta. You look after me. Patricia, please don't go! I was just making a point about the  way you said... the way you stated  your aspirations. Kiss my aspirations. Oh, very clever.  The height of cleverness. Waiter! Yes? Could you do away with her dinner,  and any evidence of her, and bring  me an big glass of vodka? But absolutely! A man who can't control his woman is  funny. What'samatter, Uncle Bobo? Tonight Mr. Johnny's gonna propose  marriage. How you know that? He arranged it with me. When he asks  her, then he'll wave to me and I'll  bring champagne. Good bachelor  customer for twenty years. But who  knows? Maybe he'll lose courage. Heavy duty stuff. Can I get another one of these? Definitely! May I presume to ask you a question? Sure! Do you have a girlfriend? I am alone in the world. That's very sad. How's things? No, I want to see the dessert cart. Very good. Never is a long time. My scalp is not getting enough blood  sometimes. Have Something. Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Yes? What do you mean? I don't understand. On the floor? This is a good suit. Alright. Is that man praying? So. Will you ma... The ring? A ring. That's right. She's got him on his knees. He's  ruining his suit. I like this ring. Loretta. Loretta Castorini Clark. On  my knees. In front of all these  people. Will you marry me? Bobo! The check! I feel like I have just witnessed a  car accident. When I was twenty-seven years old,  in Jersey City, I asked a woman to  marry me. She had red hair. She  smelled a jasmine. She wore black  shoes with pointy white tips. What happened? She didn't hear me. She asked me to  repeat, so she could understand what  I said. But I wouldn't repeat it.  Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor. Seven-thirty. My mother will be happy I'm getting  married. I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr.  Johnny. I forgot to wave. We'll have it at  the wedding. My mother is dying. When she is dead,  I'll come back and we'll be married. A week. Two weeks. No more. Must it be so definite? Can't we  just say that we will be married  when I get back? Alright. A month. In a month. Yeah. No, I'm going. Just across the bay, at the fuel  depot. The men wanted to try to get  home. I can't explain. I know, I am so sorry for so many  things. I love you, Moira. I love  you. I love you. International Flight Number Six-ohfour  boarding for Rome and Palermo at  Gate Twenty-six. I'll call you when I get to Mama's  house. There's one thing about this wedding  I want you to do. Call this number.  It's a business number. Ask for Ronny.  Invite him to the wedding. He's my younger brother. We haven't spoken in five years.  There was some bad blood. I want you  to call him and invite him to the  wedding. Will you do it? This is the last call for  International Flight Number Six-ohfour  boarding at Gate Twenty-six for Rome  and Palermo. I've got to go. Do you have someone on that plane? I have put a curse on that plane. My  sister is on that plane. I have put  a curse on that plane that it should  explode. Burn on fire and fall into  the sea. Fifty years ago she stole a  man from me. Today she told me that  she didn't even love him. She took  him to feel strong with me. Now she  goes back to Sicily. I have cursed  her that the green Atlantic water  should swallow her up. Neither do I. How do I look at her? Can I help you? Like a wolf, huh? You never seen a  wolf in your life. That's seven-fifty-seven. That makes ten. Thanks. Have a nice  night. You know what I see in you, Lotte? The girl I married. How long must I wait? Quanto tempo  devo aspettare? Hi. Bed. I can't sleep anymore. It's too much  like death. Alright. Let's go in the kitchen. Ti amo. What's your news? Again? You did this once it didn't work  out. What killed him? No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been  married fifty-two years an nobody  died. You were married, what, two  years, and somebody is dead. Don't  get married again, Loretta. It don't  work out for you. Who's the man? Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he  here with you telling me? More Bad Luck! I don't like his face,  Loretta. I don't like his lips. When  he smiles I can't see his teeth.  When will you do it? I won't come. I didn't give you away the first  time. Maybe. He did? That don't sound like Johnny. Where's  the ring? It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring.  It's a man's ring. Everything is temporary. That don't  excuse nothing. Let's go tell your Mother. Rose. Rose. Rose. Rose. Nobody. Loretta is getting married. I don't like him. WHAT? I have no money! I won't pay for nothing. It's wrong to just let them go. Good morning, Lucy. They run around, they mess up the  whole park. What do you want me to do? Pick up  after five dogs? I'm eighty-three  years old. God in his heaven  understands that I cannot pick up  after five dogs. You have too many dogs. Lucy. There are big things going on  in my house. My granddaughter Loretta,  the only daughter of my son Cosmo,  has engaged herself to be married a  second time. My son does not like this Johnny  Cammareri. He says he is a big baby. You should have one dog. Like Lucy.  Like me. I wish I hadda gun. If I  hadda gun, I would shoot four of  your dogs. My granddaughter wants my son to pay  for the wedding. But he does not  want to pay. I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked  my advice. If he asks my advice, I  don't know what I will say. I won't have to shoot those dogs.  They will kill each other. You think so, huh, Stupid? Those  dogs love each other. Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the  deathbed of my mother. The waitresses were very nice. My mother is slipping away. I can't talk long. Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment  when she's peaceful. Just don't wait until she's dead. Have you called my brother? Not yet. Will you do it today? Call him, make  him come to the wedding. Five years  is too long for bad blood between  brothers. Nothing can replace your  family. I see that now. Yeah, this is Ronny. Why didn't he call himself? What's wrong can never be made right. What! Somebody to see Ronny. Ronny! What! Somebody here to see you. Have you come from my brother? Why? You are going to marry my brother? I have no life. I have no life. My brother Johnny  took my life from me. And now he's getting married. He has  his, he's getting his. And he wants  me to come? What is life? They say bread is life. So I bake  bread, bread, bread. And the years go by! By! By! And I  sweat and shovel this stinking dough  in and outta this hot hole in the  wall and I should be so happy, huh,  sweetheart? You want me to come to  the wedding of my brother Johnny?!!  Where is my wedding? Chrissy! Over  by the wall! Gimme the big knife! Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut  my throat! No, I want you to see this! I want  you to watch me kill myself so you  can tell my brother on his wedding  day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife! Do you know about me? Nothing is anybody's fault, but things  happen. Look. It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago  I was engaged to be married. Johnny  came in here, he ordered bread from  me. I put it in the slicer and I  talked with him and my hand got caught  cause I wasn't paying attention. The  slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny  'cause - when my fiancï¿½ saw that I  was maimed, she left me for another  man. That's it. I don't care! I ain't no freakin  monument to justice! I lost my hand,  I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand,  Johnny has his bride! You come in  here and you want me to put away my  heartbreak and forget? Is it just a matter of time till a  man opens his eyes and gives up his  one dream of happiness? Maybe. Maybe.  All I have... Have you come here,  Stranger, Bride of my Brother, to  take these last few loaves from my  table? Alright. Alright. Upstairs. And then there is copper, which is  the only pipe I use. It costs money.  But it costs money because it saves  money. The man understood me. The woman  wanted to be cheap, but the man saw  that I was right. I brought you something. It's a present. They are little stars and birds.  Birds fly to the stars, I guess. Loretta. What's that smell? You don't have to help me. I like it well done. This is good. Uhh... Where'd Johnny find you? How'd he die? Fast. When you get engaged? Why? I don't know. No. When your husband get hit by the  bus? How many men since then? Stupid yourself. I don't care about Luck, you  understand me? It ain't that. Why you talking to me? She was right to leave me. Yes. You don't know nothing about it. I'm a wolf? What are you doing! Stop it! Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a  fool! He made me look the wrong way and I  cut off my hand. He could make you  look the wrong way and you could cut  off your whole head! A bride without a head! It's like I'm falling! It's like I'm  in the ocean! Son of a bitch! To the bed. I can't believe what is happening. I was dead. Your blood. Loretta. I've got you. What about Johnny? Alright. Alright. There will be  nothing left. Where's Loretta? We're gonna start  without her. She don't know what she's missing. I don't wanna talk about it. Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great  and about time. What's she gonna do  with the rest of her life she don't  get married? I don't wanna talk about it. My father needs a plate. Cosmo. Many years ago, when they  told me you were marrying my sister,  I was happy. When I told Rose I was  marrying Rita, she was happy. Rose, pass the wine. I never seen anybody so in love like  Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside  the house all day and look in the  windows. I never told you this cause  it's not really a story. But one  time I woke up in the middle of the  night cause this bright light was in  my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't  think a what it was. I looked out  the window, and it was the moon! Big  as a house! I never seen the moon so  big before or since. I was almost  scared, like it was gonna crush the  house. And I looked down, and standing  there in the street was Cosmo, looking  up at the windows. This is the funny  part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I  thought you brought this big moon  over to my house cause you were so  in love and woke me up with it. I  was half asleep I guess and didn't  know no better. You were altogether asleep. You were  dreaming. No. You were there. I don't wanna talk about it. Rita. Pass the wine. What? I don't know. I think it's the moon. It's so bright. It makes you look like an angel. Yeah. Looks like a big snowball. Rita. Rita. Look. It's Cosmo's moon. I mean it's that moon I was talking  about at dinner. Is he down there? No. Cosmo. I don't know. Alright now. Howl. Howl. How long must I wait? Quanto tempo  devo aspettare! What? Take it easy. Don't just become excited. You're trying to make me feel guilty. All right, I'm guilty. I confess! She didn't like me. What did you do? You ruined my life. Oh no I didn't! What? I can't do that! I'm in love with you! I can't! I'll come to the wedding. But he wants me to come! Alright. I will not come. Provided  one thing. That you come with me tonight. Once.  To the Opera. I love two things. I love you, and I  love the Opera. If I can have the  two things that I love together for  one night, I will be satisfied to  give up the rest of my life. Alright. Meet me at the Met. What sins have you to confess? Then it was not a sin. But what was  that second thing you said, Loretta? That's a pretty big sin. You should think about this. Alright. This is your penance. Say  two rosaries and... be careful,  Loretta. Reflect on your life. I absolve you in the name of the  Father, and of the Son, and of the  Holy Spirit, Amen. See you tomorrow, Chrissy. I feel great I got no sleep but I  feel like Orlando Furioso! And you were a lamb. As soft as milk. So what? The pleasure of marriage is  you sleep with the woman and then  you don't worry about nothing. Hey,  how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's  eat pasta and roll around. I don't know! That moon! That crazy  moon Cosmo sent over! Hey there You see that moon last night? Did you see it? Oh. You gotta date? Oh. Right. Well, that's romantic, too. HEY. Make me a bowl of minestrone. I've got a lot on my mind. Things  are getting bad in my house. My  daughter-in-law is mad at my son  because he will not pay for the  wedding. At dinner, my daughter-in-law  threatened to kill me. Things are  very bad in my house. Hurry up. If I hit the stick too hard, the  apple will split. If I am too timid,  the apple will fall off the stick. We're supposed to do fifty apples.  We only got twelve done. I don't know what to advise my son.  I think he should pay for the wedding,  but it is important that he don't  look ridiculous. Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at  dinner. I will. But I must find the right  moment. Yes! Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five  minutes. Hi. You look beautiful. Your hair... Thank you. Marc Chagall. A Russian. He was having some fun. Yeah, well  he's dead. Come on, let's go in. Thank you! I don't know. For your hair. For  your beautiful dress. For... you  know, I feel like a man again. You  know I love the Opera. You know it's  been a long time since I've been to  the Opera. Come on. Here we go. Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who's coming? Okay. I got a table for you right now. This alright? Enjoy your meal. Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You  eating alone tonight? Very good. Well, its the only response I've  got. You wanna see a menu? But it is, isn't it? I think you like the mud and I don't.  That's fair, isn't it? If I don't  care to... Sorry about that, folks. She's a  very pretty mental patient. Don't mind about me. But could you  do me a favor and clear her place  and take away all evidence of her,  and bring me a big glass of vodka? Absolutely! I'm sorry if we disturbed you. My lady friend has a personality  disorder. Thanks, comrade. It's nothing! Ouch. Too young! I just got that.  You know how to hurt guy. How old  are you? Sorry. That was rude. Are you sure? Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating  alone, and it's amazing how often I  end up doing just that. I'm a professor. I teach  communications at N.Y.U. Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was. Yes. I'll remember that. What do you do? Then why are you eating alone? Go ahead. Nerves. Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I  chase women? I find women charming. I teach these classes I've taught  for a million years. The spontaneity  went out of it for me a long time  ago. I started off, I was excited  about something and I wanted to share  it. Now it's rote, it's the  multiplication table. Except  sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning  along and I look up, and there's  this fresh young beautiful face, and  it's all new to her and I'm this  great guy who's just brilliant and  thinks out loud. And when that  happens, when I look out among those  chairs and look at a young woman's  face, and see me there in her eyes,  me the way I always wanted to be and  maybe once was, then I ask her out  on a date. It doesn't last. It can  go for a few weeks or a couple of  precious months, but then she catches  on that I'm just a burnt out old  gasbag and that she's as fresh and  bright and full of promise as  moonlight in a martini. And at that  moment, she stands up and throws a  glass of water in my face, or some  action to that effect. It's the best thing there is. I like your dress. It's very bright. I don't know. I got a feeling. May I walk with you a ways? You knew that man? Awful? Yeah. She had TB. Wait for me by the doors, Mona. Excuse me. What'd you do to your hair? What are you doing here? Who is this man? You're engaged! You're my daughter. I won't have you  acting like a tramp! Alright. I didn't see you here. Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a  drink. You mean the whole house? My God, it's a mansion! I live in a one-bedroom apartment.  What exactly does your husband do? Well. That explains it. Temperature's dropping. I guess you can't invite me in? People home. I'm a little cold. We could go to my apartment. You  could see how the other half lives. I'm too old for me. That's my  predicament. Good night. Can I kiss you on the  cheek, too? I'm freezing Another Old-Fashion? Loretta? I think that's it. What do you want to do now? Yeah. It smells like snow. What's the matter? You're making me feel guilty again. Of what? Only God can point the  finger, Loretta. And what do you know? You tell me my  life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a  wolf? You run to the wolf in me,  that don't make you no lamb! You're  gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna  sell your life short? Playing it  safe is just about the most dangerous  thing a woman like you could do. You  waited for the right man the first  time, why didn't you wait for the  right man again? I'm here! We're here. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Why? I was. I don't know. Everything seems like  nothing now against that I want you  in my bed. I don't care if I burn in  hell. I don't care if you burn in  hell. The Past and Future is a joke  to me now. I see that they're nothing,  I see they ain't here. The only thing  that's here is you. And me. I want  you to come upstairs. Now. I tried  to take everything last night, like  you told me, but I couldn't. I  couldn't take everything in a hundred  years. It's the way we are. We  compound each other. No. No. Come upstairs. I don't care why you  come. No, that's not what I mean.  Loretta, I love you. Not like they  told you love is and I didn't know  this either. But love don't make  things nice, it ruins everything, it  breaks your heart, it makes things a  mess. We're not here to make things  perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The  stars are perfect. Not us. We are  here to ruin ourselves and break our  hearts and love the wrong people and  die! The storybooks are bullshit.  Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't  try to live your life out to somebody  else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't  try to live on milk and cookies when  what you want is meat! Red meat just  like me! It's wolves run with wolves  and nothing else! You're a wolf just  like me! Come upstairs with me and  get in my bed! Come on! Come on!  Come on! 19 Cranberry Street. Hello. I'm sorry to call so late... I came right from the airport. Can you wake up Loretta? I need to  talk to her. Thank you. Where is she? It's late. Maybe I should go? That's what I came to tell Loretta.  There's been a miracle. My mother's recovered. The breath had almost totally left  her body. She was as white as snow.  And then she completely pulled back  from death and stood up and put on  her clothes and began to cook for  everyone in the house. The mourners.  And me. And herself! She ate a meal  that would choke a pig! Yes. Who was that? Well. There's the Bible story. God  took a rib from Adam and made Eve.  Maybe men chase women to get the rib  back. When God took the rib, he left  a hole there, place where there used  to be something. and the women have  that. Maybe a man isn't complete as  a man without a woman. I don't know. Maybe because he fears  death. I don't know. Hi. Hi. Hello, Mr. Castorini. I don't know, Rose. I don't know  where I've been, and I don't know  where I'm going. You should have your eyes opened for  you, my friend. I have my eyes open. You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go  on any long trips. I don't know what you mean. I know you don't. That's the point.  I'll say no more. You haven't said anything. And that's how much I'm saying. What? Thank you, Rose. I'm going to bed now. I'm going. Good! You don't know where Loretta is? Then tell her I'll come by in the  morning. We need to talk. Is Johnny here? Good! We can get this out on the  table. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. Oh. Good. We're not close. I'm not  really moved. No. I'm gonna wait. Yes, I would like some oatmeal. His brother. You're Johnny's brother? Yeah. I am old. The Old are not wanted.  And what they say has no weight.  But, my son, I must speak. You should  pay for the wedding of your only  daughter. You are breaking your house  through pride. There. I've said it. It's okay, Pop. If she gets married,  I'll pay for the whole thing. Yes. Okay. A man... under stands one day...  that his life is built on nothing.  And that's a bad, crazy day. Ti amo. I'll get it. No, I'll tell him. Tell him the truth, Loretta they  find out anyway. Hi, Loretta. We just come from the bank. I knew she had it. I'm his brother. I'm Raymond Cappomaggi. I'm Rose's  brother. Nice to meet you. Somebody tell a joke! I thought he was in Palermo. Loretta... Johnny... Ronny! Our mother has recovered from  death! Good. Have you come to make peace with me? Well. Yeah. You may not want to. Of course I want to. We should talk alone. Well. I told my mother that we were  to be married. And she got well.  Right away. I'm sure she did. It was a miracle! I have something to tell you. But I  must talk to you alone. Loretta, I can't marry you. If I marry you my mother will die. Loretta, what are you talking about? Because my mother was dying! But now  she's not. You're forty-two years old, Johnny,  and Mama is still running your life. And you are a son who doesn't love  his mother! I must ask for that back. In time, you will see that this is  the best thing. Loretta? Will you marry me. What? Could I a... borrow that ring. Thanks. Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini  Clark? What's the matter, Pop? Everybody take a glass. Wait. Here. I don't want it. To... the family. Right? Ti amo. That's right. To family.
