I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny. Very good. Uh-huh Very good, Mr. Johnny. Are you ready?A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day. Okay. Yes. His brother. I'm going to bed now. Thank you, Rose. What? I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going. You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend. Rita. Pass the wine. I don't wanna talk about it. I won't pay for nothing. I have no money! I don't like him. Nobody. Loretta is getting married. You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming. Rose, pass the wine. I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna talk about it. And that's how much I'm saying. I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more. You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips. Hi. Hi. Alright. I didn't see you here. You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp! Who is this man? You're engaged! What are you doing here? What'd you do to your hair? Let's go tell your Mother. Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing. It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring. That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring? He did? Maybe. I didn't give you away the first time. I won't come. More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it? Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me? No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man? What killed him? You did this once it didn't work out. Again? What's your news? Ti amo. I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death. Bed. I don't know. I got a feeling. I like your dress. It's very bright. They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess. I brought you something. The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right. And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes. We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done. Hurry up. I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other. You have too many dogs. It's wrong to just let them go.I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you. Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain. No, I'm going.I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding. No, I want to see the dessert cart. And I'll have the special fish. We will both have the Salad Ticino. Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight? You haven't said anything. I don't know what you mean. I have my eyes open. Hello, Mr. Castorini. What? In time, you will see that this is the best thing. I must ask for that back. If I marry you my mother will die. Loretta, I can't marry you. I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone. Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away. We should talk alone. Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful. The waitresses were very nice. My mother is slipping away. Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother. We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it? He's my younger brother. There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding. I'll call you when I get to Mama's house. Yeah. Alright. A month. In a month. Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back? A week. Two weeks. No more. My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married. Seven-thirty. I like this ring. Alright. This is a good suit. On the floor? I don't understand. What do you mean? Yes? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Have Something. My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes. Never is a long time. A man who can't control his woman is funny. Maybe you're right. No? Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk. You don't know where Loretta is? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe because he fears death. Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman. Who was that? Yes. The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig! My mother's recovered. That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle. Maybe I should go? It's late. Where is she? Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her. I came right from the airport. And you are a son who doesn't love his mother! Because my mother was dying! But now she's not. It was a miracle! Of course I want to. Have you come to make peace with me? Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death! Loretta...Yes! I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous. At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house. You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other. What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs. Good morning, Lucy. I will. But I must find the right moment. Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner. If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick. Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say. I don't know. My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay. My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby. Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.Thanks, comrade. Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka? What happened? Do you have a girlfriend? May I presume to ask you a question? Can I get another one of these? Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka? I'm freezing Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too? I'm too old for me. That's my predicament. We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives. I'm a little cold. People home. I guess you can't invite me in? Temperature's dropping. You knew that man? May I walk with you a ways? I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect. Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming. Nerves. Go ahead. Then why are you eating alone? I'll remember that. What do you do? Yes. Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was. I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U. Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that. Are you sure? Sorry. That was rude. Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you? My lady friend has a personality disorder. I'm sorry if we disturbed you.Well. That explains it. I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do? My God, it's a mansion! You mean the whole house?I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life. You should think about this. That's a pretty big sin. Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta? What sins have you to confess?No. You were there. I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better. Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married? We just come from the bank. Hi, Loretta. You gotta date? Oh. Did you see it? Hey there ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES... WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU! I knew she had it. Oh. Right. You see that moon last night? I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over! So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around. And you were a lamb. As soft as milk. I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso! I don't know. Cosmo. I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner. Is he down there? No. It's Cosmo's moon. Look. Rita. Rita. Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark? Will you marry me. Loretta? Loretta, what are you talking about? No, I'll tell him. No. I'm gonna wait. Good! We can get this out on the table. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. Is Johnny here? Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on! No. No. I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other. I was. Why? Yeah. Yeah. That's right. We're here. I'm here! And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again? Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta. You're making me feel guilty again. What's the matter? Yeah. It smells like snow. What do you want to do now? I think that's it. Yeah. Awful? It's the best thing there is. Come on. I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera. Thank you! He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead. Come on, let's go in. Marc Chagall. A Russian. Thank you. You look beautiful. Your hair... Hi. Alright. Meet me at the Met. I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life. That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera. Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing. But he wants me to come! I'll come to the wedding. I can't! I'm in love with you! I can't do that! What? Oh no I didn't! You ruined my life. What did you do? She didn't like me. All right, I'm guilty. I confess! You're trying to make me feel guilty. Don't just become excited. Take it easy. What? It makes you look like an angel. It's so bright. I don't know. I think it's the moon. What? Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left. What about Johnny? I've got you. Loretta. Your blood. I was dead. I can't believe what is happening. To the bed. Son of a bitch! A bride without a head! He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head! Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool! Stop it! What are you doing! I'm a wolf? You don't know nothing about it. Yes. She was right to leave me. Why you talking to me? I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that. Stupid yourself. How many men since then? When your husband get hit by the bus? No. I don't know. Why? When you get engaged? Fast. How'd he die? Where'd Johnny find you? This is good. Uhh... I like it well done. You don't have to help me. Loretta. What's that smell? I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget? That's it. It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fianc� saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man. No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife! Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat! I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me. I have no life. You are going to marry my brother? Why? Have you come from my brother? What's wrong can never be made right. Why didn't he call himself? Yeah, this is Ronny. You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life. I'm sure she did. Well. Yeah. You may not want to. Good. Johnny...It's nothing! Absolutely! She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor. When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips. I am alone in the world. Sure! Definitely! But absolutely! Yes?
