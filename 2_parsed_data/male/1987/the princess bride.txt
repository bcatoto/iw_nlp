You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave... ... but nobody withstands The Machine. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 69. The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken. Till they kill you. Yeah. Don't even think -- -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.Well ... ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one. Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing. Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39. You're quick. I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed. It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38. I could kill you now. We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone. I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss. Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini. Which way is my way? What do I do? You be careful. -- people in masks cannot be trusted. Don't say that, Vizzini. Please. Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself. I thought I was going faster. I only dog paddle. Anybody want a peanut? I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl. You never said anything about killing anyone. Who's Guilder? I'll be right back. I hope we win... Inigo. Don't pester him, he's had a hard day. At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it. Will this do? Over the Albino, I think. You've been mostly dead all day. How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works? Has it been fifteen minutes? Inigo -- there's more than thirty -- I have a little. The body? Everybody ... MOVE!! The Man in Black? But you don't know where he is. -- where? -- what? -- I don't think more than ten. He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men. Yeah? You don't look so good. You don't smell so good either. True! Hello. If there are, we'll all be dead. Yes, some of the time. He's really very short on charm.As you wish... Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 124. Now I think you ought to go to sleep. No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it. Okay. All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair. Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90. I don't understand. You want me to read this or not? -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up. It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse. All right, then. No more interruptions. ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen. Do you want me to go on with this? Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair. Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you. So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor. Someday, you may not mind so much. What is it? What's the matter? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56. Because I can stop now if you want. The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous. Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered -- It was a very emotional time for Buttercup -- Keep your shirt on. Let me read. Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea. -- wait, just wait -- Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around. Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that. Isn't that a wonderful beginning? Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right. The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin. That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you. Open it up. I brought you a special present.He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK! What? Right, right, sorry. Where did you get that? Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had? We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back. Tilt his head back. Open his mouth. We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand. What's the difference? We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him. I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91. Have you any money? Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body. -- Fezzik, please -- His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering? Excuse me -- Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace. To find the Man in Black, obviously. -- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go -- No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black -- That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many. I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82. How many could you handle? Perhaps not. I feel fine. It's you. FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead? Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme. Probably he means no harm. You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life. No. Where's Fezzik? Now? Now? I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? -- Why? You can't even lift one. There we cannot help you. Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel. And it is guarded by sixty men. Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen. Let me explain -- -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99. Your guess is as good as mine -- I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH! -- offer me everything I ask for -- -- power too -- promise me that -- -- offer me money -- Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. Thank you for everything. Humiliations galore! True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that. What's that? He's dead. He can't talk. I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years. This is noble, sir. His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation. Sixty-five. We're really in a terrible rush. Sir. Sir. He's already dead. Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years? Kill me quickly. Okay. I must know. Who are you?! Tell me. I ought to be after twenty years. I am not left-handed. Because I know something you don't know. I admit it -- you are better than I am. You are wonderful! Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro. Begin! You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you. You are ready, then? More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge. I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done. We'll wait until you're ready. You don't know any way you'll trust me? I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard. But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top. I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you. I do not suppose you could speed things up? Sorry. Slow going? Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly. I want to duel him left-handed. You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means. My God! He's climbing. He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us. Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using. I don't swim. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there. You're sure nobody's following us? Making sure nobody's following us.... as ... you ... wish... Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead? I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are. He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53. Does it bother you to hear? Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago? I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time. Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me? With pride. What can I do for you? Rest, Highness. "Are not capable of love" is what you mean. You admit to me you do not love your fiance? You think your dearest love will save you? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 50. And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness. Catch your breath. They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder. I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know. Why should that make such a difference? Why is that, do you think? And a good thing too. Look are you just fiddling around with me or what? Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting. You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people? I believe you -- So what happens now? I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either -- Get used to disappointment. No one of consequence. I am not left-handed either. There's something I ought to tell you. You're amazing! And what is that? Then why are you smiling? Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so. I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain -- You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die. Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30. Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday. You've done nothing but study swordplay? How old were you? Do you always begin conversations this way? Again. Thank you. Nothing comes to mind. No good. I've known too many Spaniards. That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait. That does put a damper on our relationship. If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Thank you. Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me. You guessed wrong. What's so funny? Then make your choice. You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work -- You're just stalling now. Australia. Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. You've made your decision then7 What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man. Inhale this, but do not touch. Good. Then pour the wine. Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits. Yes. You're that smart? But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse. Perhaps an arrangement can be reached. Let me explain-Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find. Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight. Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable. Yes. Of course. I swear it will be done. Could this be a trap? Shall we track them both? Who won? How did it end? -- anything you want -- -- all that I have and more please -- -- yes -- No -- Stop saying that!Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow. Okay. I don't mind so much. What? What? No! I'm okay. I'm okay. -- sit down. All right? Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who? Who gets Humperdinck? Westley's only faking, right? See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck? Yes. I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right! You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair. Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good. They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part? Oh no. No, please. No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing. Well, I wasn't nervous. What? -- murdered by pirates is good -- I don't be-leeve this. -- well, when does it get good? What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book? -hold it, hold it- Yeah. It's really good. It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake. Has it got any sports in it? A book? What is it? He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that. Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick? What? A little bit.Finish him, finish him. Your way. Give her to me. Catch up with us quickly. I'm waiting! -- I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all. You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains. Faster! Veer left. Left. Left! No more rhymes now, I mean it. Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass. I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition. Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed. The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. Go! It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder. Oh, have it your way. You know what a hurry we're in. He didn't fall? Inconceivable!! Inconceivable! Whoever he is, he's too late -- -- see? The Cliffs of Insanity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. Go in, get after her! What? As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask? Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over- That would be inconceivable. You only think I guessed wrong -- -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool. I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours. I will. And I choose -- It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is. You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 46. Wait till I get going! Where was I? Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. Hmm. I smell nothing. I accept. For the Princess? Morons. Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates? I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains. There will be no arrangement -- -- and you're killing her! -- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43.You don't believe me? So it's to be torture. Then why bother curing me? Then I'm here till I die? Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness? Did you say, "I do"? It never happened. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 117. It never happened. What hideous sin have you committed lately? Gently!! Gently. Now, was that so terrible? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64. Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist... I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too. No. No. We have already succeeded. Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened. I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59. This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts. Singed a bit, were you? Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57. There will never be a need. Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while. I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me? Can you move at all? This is true love. You think this happens every day? Hear this now: I will come for you. Of course you will. As you wish. As you wish. Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why -- I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right -- I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon. No. To the pain. DEATH FIRST!! It will not happen! Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit. You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept. Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts. In that case -- I thought he was with you. Light him. Not yet. True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside. Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak. And our assets? That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying. Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? -- I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
