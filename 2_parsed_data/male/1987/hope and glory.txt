Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen? It's true. With Mrs. Evans. I hate her. I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well. Very well, Grandpa. But Grandpa, you said... Why? No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn. I know. I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off. Can I try? Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year. Won't they have maps? Bugger off, you bloody sod. Bloody. Sod. Bugger off. I only know one. Yes. I don't mind. My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time." The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites. I know a secret. I never was. Looking for shrapnel. No, she didn't. Pauline. It's easy. I've done it. Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam. Not now. They wouldn't believe me. You do it. You're a girl. Go and ask her if she wants to play. Could. Would. It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home. Well, for the baby, really. You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam. It's Canadian. Where'd you get it? Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face. It's not the same. Can't we just see the end? ...and six... ...and four and five... It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart. I did see them. I did. You said that last year, Dad. It's like telling fibs. But Dad, It's the News. Crocodiles! Aah! Who pays for them? Wow! What's that?Please yourself. I swear I don't know. Here's your Christmas present. I don't know? We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow. Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts. Boy, that was some air-raid. Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but.... I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass. Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing? It was great for me, how was it for you.The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we. That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son. Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this. Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes. The sodding water table. And the bride. Here's to music. And absent friends. And I'm still just a lad myself. Don't panic! Keep your head! Bugger the Buffs. I don't understand. Is there any point to it? Except the servicemen. How's your war, Mac? There was talk of planting some when we first came. Why not? What about it? What kind of war is this Mac? Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about. I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past. Made my hair stand on end. I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years. If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will. Kiss me Hardy. Weeds will grow, Mac. And Jim. ...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat. Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching. Fair enough. The river. Where to? I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt. Not till Christmas, I don't suppose. A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England. I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished. That's it. Taste it. Why don't you taste it? Jam is jam! It's just jam! Well? Well, it's off ration. We know that. Jam. Oh, that. What's that? We all had to write a last letter home. We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.Apparently so. You're much more convincing when you're making it up. You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk. Only till they get you into the local school. You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school. Give him the you-know-what. I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil... This is going too far, young man. Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you. Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity? You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another. That was a googly! Never let a rat creep up on you. Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it. So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far. What's that? What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn. You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us. And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness. To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson... ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.We will, you will, for the rest of our lives? They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8. Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have. And absent bridegrooms! Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all. So you're going to be a grandfather. I will if you will! You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs. There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time. Naturally. Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else. Propaganda. We've been had. You need trees for an avenue. Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue. Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street. What did we know? We were seventeen. You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot. Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you. Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold. What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter. ....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs. ...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin. Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship. Look after yourself, Grace. You might still have a house. We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that. We did the decent thing. Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't. It's all better left unsaid, Grace. She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.' A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless. Happy days. When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly. ...since I used to take you to the Proms? Play something, Grace. Grace! It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake. How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork. They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way. OK. You're in. Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod. Bloody. Sod. That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off. Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer. Say them. Do you know any swear words? You want to join our gang? They're not. Who told you that? What's that? Yes, you was. Make him talk. What are you doing here? This is our territory Yes, she did, didn't she? Pauline's mum got killed.
