I hope the man knows what he's doing.... They won't kill it.... Bang sticks are like yelling at it.... What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...? Sweet breezes...Sweet women.... Spent it all on beer.... You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....Yes you can.... Give me a hand here for Christ's sake.... My vision is perfect.... There's nothing to be sorry about. Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why. Blushing suits you.... I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody. There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations.... Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean. We could take a few days.... I borrow it without telling him.... I'll nick the boss' plane again.... I like to travel.... I could take some time off.... I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while.... I tried winter once. Burlington, Vermont. Flew a run to New York. I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed. When I was a small boy.... But it gets cold in winter.... Our little island seems to agree with you.... I have two right feet. Would you suffer through a dance with me? All or nothing. You want to roll them for me? Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline.... A big one.... A drink with an umbrella in it.... Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life.... Sharks come and go, Ellen. People don't have anything to do with it.... No, you're not.... What's wrong? How do you like flying? They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut.... Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters.... One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon. Went down in the jungle.... You're doing fine. I'll keep you out of trouble. Relax.... It's just like driving a car.... If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute. No one does till they learn.... Sure you can.... Boss' day off...Take the wheel.... Depends on where you want to go.... I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities.... It could have been an accident.... I always listen to my feelings.... Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier.... Mostly it feels like driving. You digging for buried treasure? I'm the captain of this majestic ship. It goes where I take it.... First time for everything is the best. After that you know too much and it's never quite the same. I own the airplane. I can do whatever I want. I'm the boss. Can you keep a secret? Something no one else knows? Just like that? You the architect? I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....' Want to go for a little ride? The wind does that. Ever been to the Bahamas before? I'll get it back next time. I have coffee in the thermos. Aye, aye, Captain.... Maybe the plane gave it indigestion.... What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ... Will you get the bloody hell out of here.... Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy.... Hell, no. What kind of pilot do you think I am...? Grab your socks.... She said it was coming.... When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up. Don't worry.... You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub.... I hope she's a good sailor.... It was theirs anyway. I 11 buy us all a drink.... The damn thing is going to have our asses.... Nothing! What the hell are you doing down there? All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain.... Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion.... I fly elephants for smugglers.... What's that....? The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers. Good news travels fast....You too, Michael.... Let me speak to Ellen.... Feathers all over the place.... Oh, boy.... She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time.... She's a tough lady.... How's Ellen? Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing? Still tagging conch? Yeah.... I don't know what the hell to say.... Tell Thea I'm sorry....He knows what he has to do.... We'll divert it...We'll do something.... We're going down. All of us.... Get the bang sticks. We're going down. What difference does it make? It's here.... You have something to say about everything.... We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it.... Michael! Michael! This thing working? Keep it steady.... They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it They don't care what it is.... Get her started.... It'll come for the plane. It's attracted to metal. The electro- magnetic impulse.... You sure you know how to do this. What do you mean, it'll find her? She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it. We couldn't.... You got a better idea...? A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it.... We'll buy you one. We're having a party.... I'm the one who wanted to study it.... We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you. Get it on me.... No way.... My equipment doesn't crap out.... I forgot my rubber gloves. Let's do it. Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch. Just like taking a picture. Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away.... All the time.... If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it. We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio. You jump, you'll kill yourself.... What the hell are you doing? Holy Christ.... You told me what? Tough shit. 'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...' You don't like my voice...? You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one? 'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...' Don't be so down, man. Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made.... 'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....' 'A Moray eel....' A Moray eel...A Moray eel.... Just trying to be helpful.... Maybe he only likes white meat.... Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday. Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry.... I live to hear the sound...You all right? She's not going to like it.... What about Carla's gig? I don't like it.... It's my turn in the barrel, man.... Close...I don't know...Just get the hell.... Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor. If he comes back I'll hear him. You'll have time to get up. If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie.... We lost it.... He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around.... Half don't...Bring her about.... Bring her about. We're headed in the wrong direction.... You think he's not good enough for her? You're right. If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now. I don't remember. One day he was just here.... Who? Bring her to starboard. As long as he's been here.... What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this? What? Shit.... What are we getting out of this old bucket? So far.. Lots of times.... You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned.... I thought we were planning a long rosy future together. The shark will get it for us. We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas. There's never been one down here before. I'm not just going to let it swim away. Okay...we got it together.... When I invited you... When I got the grant..... Okay.. .we're done, man.... We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine? You got two of them...? As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch.... Gave them the day off.... Down here.... You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark. A great big bloody wonderful shark. Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it. We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research.... Holy shit! What? I've struck the mother-lode. I'm counting... spade work.... Stop busting my hump.... You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics. You're never going to amount to anything. You're afraid of the competition out there.... A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants. You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest. Not me. I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot.... I know a guy who got money from them to study eels.... Money is money.... Office of Naval Research has some money.... May your sex life be as busy as your shirt.... Bad boy.... Where the hell's the beer...? They won't fight with me.... I missed you, is all. It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne.... Shouldn't pick on that. Sorry. I'm sorry about your brother.... You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie.... A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside.... You didn't stick them on right.... I made them, man.... The readings suck.... If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems.... We'll pass around cigars.... You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man.... You tagging them...? How many...? Try the area around the wreck.... Stop farting around.... You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see.... Woman has taste.... Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed.... She's in management.... I just want to make an honest woman of you.... Happy birthday, darling. ... Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here.... More beautiful with each passing minute... Who grows more beautiful.... I knew there was a reason I could afford this. To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful.... How much longer? This is supposed to be your party. Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....I'm sorry. Please, Carla. I didn't think there was any danger. I'm sorry. I love you. Both of you. Where's my mother? Where is she? Sweetheart.... It went away.... But it went away...We would have known.... What's wrong? What happened? They're at the beach.... I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy. Off.... Turn it off.... No fair, I'm not armed. What the hell are we arguing about? Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage.... I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out.... How come it's my responsibility? I thought artists worked with their subconscious.... My brain is shrinking. There's only so much room. I miss him, Matt. I still can't believe he's gone. I'll be right there. Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks.... Make a list. She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach.... It sure is.... My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets.... No way.... Please, Mom. At least consider it. You should get away. You shouldn't be alone now.... Nowhere.... It was a piece of wood. A shitty piece of wood. It's not fair.... He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way.... I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night.... I'm going to finish what Jake and I started. I owe him that. Hell, I owe him everything.... I'll get something important done for both of us.... I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be.... Promise me you'll be all right.... There's a lot...I want to talk about it.... Why'd you take the boat? It got him.... No. I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark. Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up. I don't want to talk about that. There's nothing to worry about.... I m not unhappy. Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little. It'll work out.... I have to get this finished. I'm fine.... Trying to write our report.... You just got here.... I'm pleased. I really am. Really.... Good. You're not a pain in the ass.... I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him.... You're having a good time.... I'm not going to quit now.... Mom, please don't start that again.... Nothing out of the ordinary.... Good. So will I.... Okay. All you all right? Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something.... Come on, I'll show you around. It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab.... There's never been a great white where we live. It's warm water... They don't like it.... Dad died from a heart attack.... Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo. Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person.... Mom, you're upset. Sit down...Please.... I'm just getting started.... Come on, Mom, you can't be serious.... What? Sit down, Ma.... Mother.... It needs more time to charge. What happened? Come on, Hoagie.... Can't this thing go any faster? What do you deliver on all those charters you...? I want you to leave her alone. I don't want you involving her in.... Mind if I cut in? Your date's lonely.... Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table.... I'll get her. Have a good Christmas, Matt.... It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them. The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing.... Would you talk to her? She's got it in her head that the shark came for him. She still blames it for my father's death.... I wish there was something I could do.... She has good days and bad...I don't know.... Inch by inch.... We'll be done pretty soon.... Still chasing fish? You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel.... Matt? Jake. It's my fault...I have to.... I'll do it, Jake. Your equipment has crapped out again.... The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his.... If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself.... It'll work.... Anybody ever tell you you're nuts.... I've got to get to her.... Mom.... Screw you, Jake.... I don't like the song. Stop that! Shove it.... Shit.... 'Snuck up on me....' 'It was so ugly...It was so big....' Funny, Jake...Funny. How come only me? What about the monitor...? You getting anything on the shark? You getting a reading on them? I'm going down, Jake.... I didn't ask you to.... You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again.... I'm coming...How close is it? I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them. You hearing anything? Maybe it's gone.... Maybe the gear crapped out.... I hear he flies a lot of private charters.... I am...You must know something about him.... Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off.... What's so funny about that? What do you know about him? Hoagie. How long has he been here...? How long? How long have you known Hoagie? How long have you known Hoagie? What she's got. Nine knots.... And it's always worked? You sure you've done this before? I don't know shit about electronics.... So did I.... My name goes on that report. It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate. Neither do you.... We have at least three months' work left. We can't write a report...We don't know enough.... We got it together, Jake.... When I signed on.... When we got the grant.... We don't write up anything until we're done.... What for? We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor? What happened to Clarence and...? Where is everybody? Don't say anything about this to my mother.... Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor.... Spade's a garden tool.... I wish you wouldn't say that.... Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me.... How many? He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own.... It's not a bad life, Jake.... They put bombs on dolphins.... Forget it.... Sharp shirt, Jake.... I didn't do it on purpose.... Maybe I missed you too.... Put me down, damnit.... Put me down.... Yeah, well, just stop yelling. Hey! You couldn't find your ass with both hands.... If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak.... I stuck them on, man.... Maybe it's the tags that suck.... I know how to tag a damn conch.... If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done.... We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate.... The females have eggs.... I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen.... Will you leave me alone...? Stop busting my hump....I won't.... A big one.... Good. Ask the big doctor about his work. Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day.... You check it.... We don't want any.... Adds flavor.... I'm hungry, Mom.... Can't help myself.... That hurt.... I'm not doing anything. Stop what? I'll take care of it. Cow tipping? Where's Lenny? Good night, Polly.... Anything to do before I go home? That bad, huh?
