Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem! What's the problem? Oh, sod you. Look, do you want the bed in or not?Will you sign for the bed? We're leaving. Want to buy a bed? It's my lucky day. Lucky man. Oh. Got her mother's looks. That your daughter? Do you really need this bed, lady? Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.We've got such sights to show you -- Just in time. We want the man who did this -- Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that? Nobody escapes us. Many times. No time for argument. No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering. He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us. You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures. Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others. It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration. The box... you opened it. We came.We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put. Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that. You were holding onto it like grim death. First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you? You took quite a beating. You must lie down. That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed. Please. Get back into bed.That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK. Hush now. It's all right Frank's here. Poor baby. Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him. Some things have to be endured... Come to Daddy. One last time. Give me the box. I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter... I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful. What? What will you do? What CAN you do? There's nothing to be frightened of. Come to Daddy. You remember. Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank. Kirsty? I need a skin. Then we leave -- Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS? There's very little I can do about it. Maybe. I don't think so. She'll want Larry first. Then find me somebody else, before they come looking. So where's the harm? You can't love him. It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes? They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it. No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible. You would be. They tore me apart. The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free. Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box. Sure. Somewhere safe. Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room. I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth. To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which. Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors. It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle. This is what began it. A long time. Not know. What? Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some? You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse... Ssh. Don't want babe to hear. Poor Larry. Obedient as ever. The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here. -- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking. One more. Maybe two -- My nerves... are beginning to work again. I'm hurting The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back... You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't. ...somebody... Just help, will you? Please God, help me -- His blood... on the floor... It brought me back. Believe me. It's me. It's really me. Frank. Help me. I said: don't look. Don't look at me. Julia. Sure you are. Wedded bliss? Forget him. I don't want to see the dress. I don't want to see the dress. Well can I come in or not? There is going to BE a wedding? I came for the wedding. I'm brother Frank. You're Julia, right?You fucking ass-holes. My fucking hand! Christ! Just take it slowly. Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work. Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not? Julia's my second wife. Her mother's dead. Uh-huh. Alright, let's give it another try. It'll go in. He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery -- What are you talking about? What's wrong? What's wrong with you? Huh? Come with me then. Oh baby. What's wrong with you? No. I'll do it. Only I'll turn it off -- Are you all right? Is this upsetting you? Kirsty. O.K. O.K. Sure. Can I get you anything? Oh, babe... Are you all right? Sweetheart... I've been calling you. Julia? Are you O.K.? Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding. Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company. I'll be scarred for life. So damn stupid. I'm going to throw up. Shit. I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood. I cut myself. How are you doing through there? We'll move in Sunday. Well? He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit. Where are you? I hear you. Oh Christ. Julia... So what's the argument? You wanted to come back to London. We came back. You're still blaming me. You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it. He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors. We'll sell it. Sell everything. I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway. The best part of ten years. It's just been empty a while. Ah! Like who? O.K. O.K. It's ONE of these. Where are you going? No. It's all over. What's the problem? Show her. No you don't. I'm afraid it's true. Poor Frank. He's better off dead. He's gone. Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now. It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right... Of course. Maybe all she needs is some company. Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends. I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me. It's like she's waiting for something. She doesn't even want to leave the house. You don't like her at all do you? I guess. ...maybe we should never have come back. I love you, honey. Never better. You sleep well. Steve? What are you drinking, love? Are you O.K.? Kitchen's through on your left. Kirsty. Upstairs. Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving. I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved. You like? Call me tomorrow. O.K. You will keep in touch. I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us. What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture -- Well come over, will you? See the place? Well I want you to see the house. Do you want me to come over? You'd like the house. I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile? What did you say? Where are you? Kirsty? Who's there?'Bye. I'll come back later, huh? What did I say? What? I won't let anybody take you. What's wrong? What things? What happened to you? It's a fetish of mine. Can I lend you a hand? Are you busy after work ? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you. Your father told me you were working here. Are you alright ? Well you've just been talking to the wrong people. Oh no. We're not all frigid. I beg your pardon? Meaning what? I see. Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room. We walk. If there's a train. Please. I want to see you home. All right? It's late. I thought we'd lost you. Need any help? You're not going? So lie down. We're on the Cointreau.
