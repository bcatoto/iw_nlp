Time to activate Plan B. They're gaining on us! We blew it, Edgar! We lost it! We don't ride with vampires. They wouldn't be out in the daytime. You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy. Why not? He's a vampire alright. Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet. Can't stand light? Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us. We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh? How do you like Santa Carla? This one could save your life. Just passing through Santa Carla? The meanest! Maximum body-count. You know what? You're absolutely right. Whattaya mean? Two down and two to go. Did you see that sucker burn?! Good. They're gonna book us. We unraveled in the face of the enemy! Should I run him through? The nightcrawler. The bloodsucker. Zero. Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.You're one of us, now -- aren't you? If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us. Hey, take it easy. What's goin' on, Marko? Get your bike. We're going someplace. Why? They're only noodles. You're eating maggots. How do they taste? So how do you like those maggots, Michael? Good idea. Marko. We're hungry. You don't have to beat me, Michael. Just try to keep up. C'mon, Star. Climb on. Honda 250, huh? No, Star. Put it down. Put it down. You can't kill me, Star. You're almost one of us now, Michael. Sorry, Michael. No hard feelings, huh? Here. Try these noodles. No. Stick around. With him? Where you going?The baddest! We are awesome monster-bashers! Death to all vampires! Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid. I don't trust 'em. I say we terminate 'em while we can. Four to go. Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass! That's just the way we like it. They're looking at us. They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man! It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked! Shut up! I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer. Have you taken any human victims yet? El Vampiro. The Prince of Darkness. Okay. Where's Nosferatu? All together? As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall. We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time. The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us. We don't have one yet. And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one. Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em! What? That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin. Let's stake 'em. Vampires, my friend. Vampires. Just so you know: If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it. To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires. He's not glowing. I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts. That is very probable. What's your reasoning? Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart. Bad breath? Long fingernails? This is just our cover. We're dedicated to a higher purpose. You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you? Well, you don't know shit, buddy. Or a vampire. Where the hell are you from, Kryton??? Don't go out there! Stop him! Okay, okay. I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest? If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.Right. An' now we're having company again . I'll take mine to go. Max? You men we're having company again? Smells good. When do we eat? It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound. Closet monster!? Ouch, my hair... Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced. I better get cleaned up, then. Did we have a date tonight? I hate goin' into town. That's about as close to town as I like to get. Are we havin' fun or what? Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days. Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years. Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me? Whatcha doin' over here? Gotta keep in practice. It's a dyin' art. Lots more where he came from. No, I just like to read the T.V. Guide . Read the T.V. Guide , you don't need a T.V... ... And stay outta here.You better not like him too much. You like Michael. No. Just you. It was a dream, Star. I know it was them, Star. I'm sure of it. He was working in the yard -- hammering something. The yard was big with lots of grass. There was no boardwalk and no ocean. She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair. I was there, too. And a dog -- but I don't know its name. I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog. They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing. And I was laughing, too. I had the dream again about them . Hi... I'm Laddie.It's you I was after all along, Lucy. To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no. It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy. One big happy family. My boys... and yours . Well... what do I know? I'm a bachelor. Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you. Let me tell you something about boys. They're like weeds. They grow best when they're ignored. Something the matter? Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change. I don't want to fight with you, Lucy. Come on. Let's give it one more try. Dinner at my house, tomorrow night. I'm cooking. Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you. Our batting average isn't very good is it? So far we're zero for two. It's garlic !! I like garlic, but... This looks terrific, Lucy. Oh, right. I always gets those two confused. Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner? Yeah. Runaways, mostly. They come from all over. Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean. Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute. But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it? So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me. Not impressed, are you? I know. It's so 'Eighties.' It's the Cute Decade. Say hello to Thorn. -- a job. So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy? We've got it all. Best selection in Santa Carla. You've got a generous nature. I like that in a person. My name is Max. Michael invited me in. Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless. Yeah. I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom. I just want to be your friend. Burn?? Are you kidding? It's freezing! Okay, Sam. Thanks.What is this, David? Where's Star, David?! Where is she?! What's going' on? I'm my own man. Don't! Stop! What?... We were gonna grab some food. I can't beat a Triumph. Star?... That's right. We still going? Sam, don't -- I said, I'll take you there . Nobody's going near Star without me. I'll take you there. David. Of course not! Get out, Mom! Run! I didn't invite you in this time! Gotta go, Mom. Can't. Got plans of my own. Mom... please. I'm tired now. We are... Sure. Okay. I watch him all day. The only time I have more myself is at night. Let Grandpa watch him. No. I'm up. I'll pass. See you later. I'll hitch. It's early. Why do we have to go home? He's not breathing, Mom. He looks dead. For what. It's gone. I feel it! They'll be coming for all of us. Huh? You've got to put this on. You're not going anywhere... Sam... I know, I've felt it... Then it's not too late for us... Why not? That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood! David's blood. I'm one of them, Star! I'm just like them! Do you know where David took me tonight, Star? Do you?! Okay. When? I have to talk to you. Please wake up. Let's go see them. Now you and David... I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you. Ouch. Are you hungry? Wanna get something to eat? Sort of. We used to come here summers when I was kid. Now we're here on a permanent basis. I'm Michael. Ex-hippies. My mom was one. I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something. But Star's great. I like Star. Oh. Your folks, too, huh? What's your name? Hi... I just wanted to... I, uh... Well... yeah. Sure. Well, I... I... I don't feel any differently. Do you? Huh?... Who are you calling? Star. I don't know. Just for a few days, Sam. Give me a chance to work this out by myself. No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her. We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me. What?? He was protecting you ! Nothing! I didn't hurt him. He bit me ! This is my blood! Nanook... Don't turn on the light. Piss off. Don't bother. Mom's home?... No. I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food. No. Why? What would that make Mom? I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots. Entertain yourself. Go away. Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.' Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay? Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night? Nowhere. You're beautiful. Okay. I'll flip you for it. This room is mine. Hey, Sam, we're flat broke. Will you give Mom a break? This is kind of a cool place. That's okay, Mom. I can see it later. I'll help you unload.What's Plan B? Well... we blew Plan A. You gotta drive! Burn rubber does not mean warp speed ! Fine! Stay here! I'll have to drive! Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed? He's my brother. Yeah. Wears sunglasses in the house . All day. I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you. I don't like horror comics. You better get some fresh air. This isn't a comic book store, right. It's a bakery. It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian. I don't like horror comics. No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection? What happens in tow and a half hours? No, Nanook! Quiet! There's a cop behind us. Oh, no... I thought they'd be in coffins. What's that smell!? Chill out Edgar. He's telling the truth! Aren't you, Michael? Hit the lights again. How do you know they're not? Well... he only shows up at the store after dark. And today, his dog attacked my mom. Listen to this. From Vampires Everywhere ... 'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a Guardian -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell -- are often employed for this purpose .' I have something to tell you guys. Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's dating one! I can't do that! His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath. Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult. Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something? Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and... And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's. I guess so. She said not to be late. Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight. I thought we were goin' into town. Great. I wanna get some new comics. Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck. What's all that wood in there for? Good! Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk! Thanks, Grandpa... You have a T.V.? Mom! -- I'm not talking about Max! To hell with Max! No, I'm not... But, Mom... This is not a joke. They know that we know about them. They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark! Vampires, Mom! Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers! The TV stations! They'll listen to you. They'll believe you... you're a mom ! Must be a circuit breaker. C'mere, Nanook. Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen. These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan. The Frog Brothers. Do you mind? It was a real scary comic. Can I sleep in here with you tonight? He's already gone to bed. Sorry, Mom. It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window. I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away... We can't talk about it on the phone. Mom. I think we've got to have a long talk about something? Soon as I finish this comic. Okay? Can we get a T.V.? He met a girl. Help me, Mom. Help. So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me. When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning? I thought we were poor. Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later. Grandpa's expecting us. Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach! Smells like something died. What's that smell? What?! Did you know that!? But you passed the test! I am? Does it burn? How about a little Parmesan cheese on that? What's the matter? Michael! Get behind the wheel. The Marines. Don't kill anybody until we get back to you... It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them? I don't know, Michael. This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'. What about Mom? Look at your reflection in the mirror!! What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you? What about Nonook? What have you done to Nanook?! What have you done to my dog, you asshole?! What happened, Michael!? Michael? You have such a great personality, Michael. You should open your own charm school. Lose the earring, Michael. It's not happening. It's just not happening. I'm making you a sandwich. No. On the phone. Wanna go to the comic book store? The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt. Did you spill something? You're right... not even to mention you and me. You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you? What did you do last night? You look wasted. You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood. Do I have to do this? Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember? Then what's the rush? You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it? I'm at the mercy of your sex glands! Where are we going? Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face. I was here first. Even poor people have T.V.s Grandpa does not own a T.V. Have you noticed? There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV. I will not know anything hip happening anymore. I'm so excited I just can't hide it. I'm about to lode control and I think I like it. What!? He can and I can't ?! No fair!!
