Lacy. . . I . . . You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one. Like me? I'm not so sure you do. I'm sorry to see you go. Gee, I'm really sorry. Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished. Oh . . . my . . . But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite. Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash. Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change. Gee, I don't think . . . Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story. I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do. If you say so. Here goes. Maybe I should sit this one out. Don't worry, I've got you. That sounds kind of pessimistic. Well, my career takes up a lot of my time. Oh . . . no, there's no one back home. No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand. Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom. I've never been in a place like this before. Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line. They make my eyes itch. And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty. I really don't think . . . Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . . . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse. You know him so well. But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is. Superman? Has something happened to him? It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . . . . . Please leave your message at the beep. Politely? 'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?' Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois. The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news. I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield. That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent. And what do we get out of it? And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman? But Superman isn't an average man. Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world. Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . . I'll try. . . Awesome! N-no...I mean...you bet. Absolutely! Well, I don't understand. But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away? What good was my letter? Impossible? Why?Lucky I brought my drums. You think he'll find us. Ready, Uncle Lex? I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex. We'll all fry. Boy, are you gonna get it. What? Good. Let's hope he stays that way. Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down. You're just an experiment, freako! Hey! He looks . . . normal. You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex. The one Superman wrecked up? Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here? Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part. Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex. Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer. Whoa. . . He missed the door, Uncle Lex. But why the hair? A toupee that flies? Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?Gee guys, that's swell of you. But . . . I've got another idea. If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it. Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave. Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man! And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again. Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . . that. Never. But we have to hide out for a while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan. If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring. Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband. This wasn't in the plan. My nephew, Leonard. He worships me. Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last. Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped. He's . . . cold. . . Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy. What was that about? Hey! Just remember I made you. He's . . . beautiful. Perfect. There! Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me. Did you hear that? Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . . Get the box, nephew. I must have miscalculated. How. . . Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . . He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . . Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious. That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me! . . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate. Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair! Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman! Stop! I command you . . . you mutant! Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear? Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were? Nifty, huh? Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable Now, destroy Superman. Wait! Not yet! Back! I made you, and I can destroy you. What? A genius? . . . an inspiration? I hadn't counted on this but . . . . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ... For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on. But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized? But . . . how could you beat him? Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back. Superman. . . But you're... dead! Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive. Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world. I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better -- he needed more energy, more power. No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman. Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar? Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block. Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . . Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call. I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great! Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.I am master now. Destiny. What do you fear? First, I have fun. Destroy Superman! I am an experiment? I am freako? You are . . . nothing. I am father now. You are . . . What I need this for?Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it. Go on . . . Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see. Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery? Would you mind taking a walk with me? I'm sorry. I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth. Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet. No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil. High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy. I'll deal with you later. Still having delusions, Lex Luthor? A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in. You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains. Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun. I'm not going anywhere. Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor. You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . . I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun! It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis? If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to? Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about? Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business. Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads! Yes, darling? Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . . Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called. Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear? Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter! Mr. White, come with me I want to see
