Look sharp. Nah.  Hates his wife. Lynn!  Lynn!! Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK? I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of  my sight, all right? I want you to  stay right by me. Will you do that  for me? We made it. Keep your eyes peeled. Too old. Him! If you ever had an idea it would die  of malnutrition. First those blue  hairs then some Spic.  Leave this to  me. I know people. It's my job. I'm  a people person. I'm looking for them. Right there. I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do  you see a phone? Come on, you. Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss  like that? You never saw your Mom and me kiss  like that? Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You  can talk about her all you want. You  know that, don't you? So, come on. You never saw us kiss  like that? How did you see us kiss? That's it? That little peck of a  kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some  kisses. Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call. Look at 'em. He'd do anything for  her.- Foreigners! Fuck! Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have  an interview with him at twelve- thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is  Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at  the last minute like this but...  Hey, hey! Watch that! Lynn, come here! Sorry. There's some crazy kids on  skates. Listen, the train just got  in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few  minutes late. Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as  I can. Bye, now. Ready? Let' s do it. Whoops. Now, see, this is why you should  always wear a helmet and knee pads.  You never know when you're going to  fall down and go boom. Right? Perfect. Could I see some identification,  sir? What? Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem?  Will a driver's license do? That'll do just fine. Is this about those kids? Look, I'm  sorry about that. But they darn  near... You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson? Yes. Near Lompoc, north. What's... Come with us, sir. I'd like to know what... Don't cause a ruckus, sir. You don't want to cause a ruckus,  with the little girl and all. Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take  the girl! Don't worry. She's good with kids. What is going on? Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat. That's right. The policeman is your  friend. Isn't that right, Daddy? Daddy? Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our  friends. Let's get down to business. Who are you? You're not the police. Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay  attention and your daughter won't be  hurt. You wouldn't... Get your hands off her. Mr. Watson, you're not paying  attention. Your daughter's life  depends on you. Do you understand  that? Yes, yes, I understand. Good. This is for you. In it there is a  picture of a woman and an itinerary.  It is her itinerary. She is presently -  are you listening, Mr. Watson? Yes, I'm listening. She is presently at the Bonaventure  Hotel. That's right near here. When you leave this van you will get  yourself a cab and take it to the  Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will  take this. ...and you will kill the woman whose  picture is in there. Not just shoot  her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend  you empty the gun into her. Close  up. Got all that? You're out of your mind. What's your point? I will do no such thing. Yes, you will, Mr. Watson. It is now 12:16. If the woman in the  picture is alive at 1:30... ...I call my partner, your daughter  is dead. And what happens if I don't call  you? Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do  you understand? The woman in the picture... ...or your daughter. Oh, my God... God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only  you can help her. You're wasting time. Let's test this thing. You on? You'11 need some cash. I'll hang onto this for the time  being. Oh, and... You'll need these. Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a  wastin'. You talk to a cop, you even look at  a cop too long and your daughter is  dead. Do it. Lynn! Yes. Yes, I can hear you. That's enough. Over and out. Look at your watch. Look at it! At  one-thirty your little girl is dead.  Say it with me. At one-thirty my  little girl is dead. Say it. Say it! At one thirty my little girl is dead. Unless you do what you're told. Go  do it! And don't forget I'll be watching  you. Where to, sir? The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure  Hotel. Do you know where that is? Amtrack? What? You just come in on Amtrack? Uh, yes.. Business or pleasure? Business. Where'd you come from? San Diego. Oh, San Diego? I've thought about  moving to San Diego.  It's hard to  make a living in this town. These  short hops.  Can't make a dime on  'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can  make a buck. These little hops cost  me money. Sorry. 'S okay. What do you think? Huh? Better in San Diego? More opportunity  there? What? I really don't know. I don't live  there. I was just visiting...a grave. Aw, too bad. Somebody close? What? The grave. Somebody close? Wife. Ex-wife. Almost ex. We were  separated. She was thinking about a  divorce. Look...I've... I've got a problem. A  big problem... Oh, yeah? Jesus! Watch it, buddy! I'd love to hear about your problem,  but the ride's over. Three-fifty. Three-fifty. I hope your problem  doesn't have anything to do with my  three-fifty. Right. Right. What do I want with an accountant? I got one for the airport. You free? You bet. Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, shit. Oh, sweet Jesus... Could you tell me where the Emerald  Bay Room is? Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow  the signs. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. No problem. Whoops! Nice body check. You know my wife has a deeply personal  reason for going after repeat drunk  drivers. They are felons and they  should be treated as such. A drivers  license is a privilege, not a right. Excuse me, is the...thing over? Eleanor Grant is gone? Check your itinerary. Move along. This says "invitation only". Of course you're invited. You're a  big donor to the campaign. They love  you. This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red  Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor. Where did you get these? Who are  you? I'm the guy who's going to kill your  daughter if you don't get moving. We didn't. A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems. Excuse me, sir, this car is for the  Governor. You can take the next one. Governor... I need your help. Its'...ah...about my daughter.... Room for one more? A pleasure to meet you, Governor. I... She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure  to get your autograph. No, that's,..that's fine Her name? Her name is Lynn. She was right in front of you! What's  wrong with you!? Are you 'fucking with me!? The gun... What about the gun? It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the  bullets in it. You... You won't get many chances like that,  Mr. Watson. That's the way life works.  Don't blow the next one. There, all loaded. Ready for the  hunt. I'm...I'm visiting. I'm just an accountant. No. No, it doesn't. Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'? I have to do something. I said I have to do something. Is within himself. Drove me crazy. There must have been  one on me. I didn't add up so she  left. That's what attracted me to  her In the first place. She made up  her mind and she did it. She wouldn't  sit around waiting for...whatever.  She'd do something. She'd do  something. Keep it. Keep it. Can I get out to Flower Street from  here? Thanks. You get another chance in ten minutes. Then I have time for a drink. All right, Mr. Watson, but make it  just one. I don't want you... So where was I? I don't know. Something about the  Governor's new regime. Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old  Boys like yesterday's newspapers. The white boys are in for it. When  they got her elected they never  thought she was gonna make the  Governor's office look like the United  Nations. We're talking Custer's Last Stand  here. The only minorities not on her  staff are the ones still lost in the  Rain Forest. Lynn! I've got him in the crosshairs. Pool Deck? Fourth Floor. Take that escalator. My wife is not interested in negative  campaigning. She wants to accentuate  the positive. I don't know about you  but I find that refreshing. Have you ever thought of running for  office yourself? Me? I'm just a business man. I know what you're thinking. What would you do in my place? Me? The bitch would be dead. Course I  ain't sayin' which bitch. There's a plot to kill the Governor.  If you don't believe me, check that  guy right there. He has a gun. So do you, Mr. Watson. You got this under control? Yeah. It doesn't look like it. It's under control. It better be. I oughta throw you after that walkie- talkie but I'm going to give you a  break because you're an amateur. Gentlemen... Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker. Have a cracker, Mr. Watson. There was this guy. Big guy. Irish- Italian. Red-faced, black-haired,  jolly son-of-a-bitch. Nobody could make me laugh like him.  We closed more bars together than I  can count. He was my pal. I loved  that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to  say it. But he was fuck-up. He had  this image of himself. Thought he  was con man. Always trying to shave  the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always  miss him. Tell me why. What...? Tell me why I miss him. He's dead? That's right. He's dead. Tell me  why. How should I...? Tell me why he's dead. You killed him. That's right, I killed him. He fucked  up one too many times so I put a  bullet in his eye. Then I put two  more into him just to make sure. Now  that was somebody I loved. I loved that motherfucker but I got  the call and I put him down like a  sick animal. So if you've got any  doubts about what's going to happen  if you don't deliver let me tell you  something. I'd make gravy out of  your little girl just to season that  black Irish cocksucker's meat. Do what you're supposed to do. Do it  now. Shit! It is my extreme pleasure this  afternoon to introduce to you... ...a woman who can only be  characterized as a one-of-a-kind. An iconoclast with class... A genuine lady who's not afraid to  get into the trenches... ...and go to the mat with greedy  special interests... The finest Governor our state has  ever had... My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor  Grant! My wife always said I had a problem  trusting people. You don't understand. I'm going to  trust you. And you have to trust me. Look...my daughter ... she's going  to die...unless you can help me. No! You have to listen to me. Please...please...you have to believe  me... They have my daughter.  They  want me to kill Eleanor Grant � or  they'll kill my daughter. No! You can't! They're in on it. I don't know. One of them is following  me. If he knew what I'd just told  you they'd... Look, how did I get in here with  this!? You've got to trust me. I'm putting  my daughter's life in your hands.  She's only six. She's just a little  girl. Please, please, trust me. You're right, it is. Here. Will you trust me now? The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll  call his partner. I do anything out  of line and he'll send the word to  kill my daughter. Are you sure? But... Okay... Hey. I think you better put that away. Where are we going? Ms. Brooks ... Yes, ma'am. Who is this? Are you sure we can  trust him? What is it? Is there a problem? We have to hurry. What? What are you talking about? This is...this is insane. How do you  know this? I know it because I'm the one who's  supposed to kill her. You are!? You brought this man here!? You  brought this man to my room!? Is there a problem, Brendan? There certainly is. This man says  he's been hired to kill Eleanor. Not hired. They're blackmailing me. Who is this "they"? I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr.  Grant! They have my daughter. I'm  not some lunatic. Your wife is in  trouble.  Someone is trying to kill  her. Someone is trying to make me  kill her. Please, listen... And on the strength of this story,  you bring this man to Brendan's suite?   Does that show good judgment, Ms.  Brooks?  I'm just a friend of  Brendan's, but it seems to me... What? I see. Where is this gun? Well, is it real? Do we know anything  about it? Could I see it? My goodness. It certainly looks real. What's your opinion? You're the expert  in these matters, supposedly. Jesus Christ! Are you out of your fucking mind!? Somebody mind telling me... What the hell happened!? Help me get her off the rug. What have you done to me!? Christ  almighty! No! You fucked up. That's enough. You want me to kill your kid!? You  want me to kill you!? Don't let him go! I killed you. You fucked up. You nearly killed him, too, you idiot! Nearly doesn't count. I'm on record. I never wanted this.  I wanted simplicity; a telescopic  sight, a powerful rifle, but no.  What was good enough for Oswald wasn't  good enough for you two. You had to  get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off  the street, stick a gun in his hand. It's academic now. She had to be  killed. What were you going to do, Brendan?  Lock her in a closet?  You're in the  fucking kitchen now. Get used to the  heat. He's been seen all over the  hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes.  We even got him on video. It'll work.  Don't worry about it. (about GENE) Is he awake? Yeah. Oh Great. Why don't we just give him  our home phone numbers while we're  at it? It doesn't matter what he hears. That's what it looks like. She was  alive a minute ago. Now she's dead.  Because you wouldn't do what I told  you to do. Get going. You've only got a few  minutes to pull it together. It's too late for that. There is a dead woman on my bathroom  floor! What about it? She's Eleanor's  assistant and they will have been  shot with the same gun, by the same  lunatic.  Some, anonymous loser who  went over the edge. Only thing better would be if he  were a postal worker. He won't be doing any work once I  get through with him. And in a few months you're in the  Governor's mansion. The people'd  make you king of California if they  could. I'm not stupid.. I know how this is  supposed, to work. Do you now, Mr. Watson? I kill her - and you kill me. Keep your voice down. Even if you don't, Her Security men  will. How am I supposed to get away? That's not my problem, Mr. Watson Come back. How do I know you won't kill my  daughter once I'm gone? Come Back....Fucking Radio. I told you she'd be alright, if you  do your job. And I'm supposed to trust you? What choice do you have? After you. Look out there! You see the van? You see it?! Come back. Do it! Lynn! Security. Take the next car. Again. No, please... You got one last chance. Half an  hour and that kid is dead. I'll kill  her myself. I'll rip her fucking  head off right in front of you! The next time I tell you to do  something, you goddamn well do it! You remember me? Something is going to happen. When  it's over you'll know what I was  talking about. Please. Something is going to  happen... Please... Come on, let's get some privacy. He's deaf. He can't hear a word we're saying. You wouldn't be kidding me now, would  you, Mr. Watson? Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't  hear me? Nigger? Yeah, sure, give me a shine... ...shine. I'm putting your toy back in your  pocket, Mr. Watson. It's all wound up. Now let's get out  your itinerary. One thirty. California Ballroom. That's right. That gives you... ...twenty-six minutes to get your  shit together. Let me talk to her again. No. I want'to talk to her. Forget about it. I talk to her or you can forget about  it. Don't you threaten me. What are you going to do about it,  shoot me? (glances again at HUEY) You know  what I'm gonna do. What? Walk out there and twist her  arm off? It would be a lot less trouble just  to let me talk to her. Come Back. Put her on. Just put her on. Yes, sweetie, it's me. I know you do, honey. Not just yet, baby. There's...there's  something Daddy has to do. No, honey, not to be a hero. But I  want you to remember something for  me, all right? He's doing it for you. No matter  what anybody tells you, no matter  who they are, he's doing it for you,  because he loves you. That's enough. Will you promise me that? All right. Kisses to you. No. Kisses to you. I don't care who the fuck you do it  for just so you do it. Hey. You done yet? It doesn't. I remember when it was a  fuckin' quarter. Twenty-five minutes. I'm not dragging you into anything.  I don't expect... What? That's right. My daughter. They have her in a van  across the street. They say they'll  kill her if I don't do something for  them. There was a woman. She was trying to  help me. I watched him murder her. Kill the Governor. One of them is in on it. He might  even be in charge. Her Security is  in on it. There's only one person I  know for sure isn't in on it. The Governor. If I could just talk  to her... No way, there's nothing you can do  to help me. It's my kid. I've got to...to  somehow...do right by my little girl. It's about time I did. I was one of  those guys, workaholics. I worked my  ass off for them - my wife, my  daughter.  That's just what I thought  I was supposed to do. So when she wanted a divorce...I  was...I didn't know what I'd done  wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see  it.... I'm sorry. You understand I don't  mind dying if I could save my  daughter. I mean that. What are you going to do? If nothing else, someone heard my  story. Keep the change. I need a drink. ...and time is running out... Give me a ...a gingerale? Man, I thought she was going to get  out the violins. No shit. If I hear that stop the  violence routine one more time I'm  going to shoot somebody. T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1 Politicians. They're all the same. You know what bothers me? When they get all weepy eyed about  the "ordinary citizen", the "regular  Joe", the "normal American". Gimme a  break. There ain't no such animal.  We're a nation of two hundred forty  million special interest groups. Well, I'm just a regular guy. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. But I've built a  good solid business out of nothing.  Don't underestimate the regular guy. Sir, you haven't paid. It's on the Special Interest at the  end of the bar. Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop. Left field bleachers heard from. Laughs. Where is he? Did you lose him? Shut up. Let's all hope so. Fue.  (Gone.) Hi. Thank you. Where am I going? Yeah. What!? What am I supposed to say to her? Excuse me... No, please. Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt  you. I appreciate that. If I were here to hurt you I would  have done it already. I have a problem. Only you can help me. I'm also sorry  to say, my problem is your problem,  Mrs. Grant. That's right. It was because I had this...in my  pocket I need you to listen to me. Carefully.  Three lives depend on you listening  very carefully to what I have to  say. Krista Brooks is dead. I saw her die. She was shot. With  this gun. No. I don't know. The only thing I know  about him is that he works for your  husband. And your husband works for somebody  else. He's gone. Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long?  You need to eat more fiber. You got anything to read? I knew you wouldn't believe me. I don't blame you. I don't have any  proof. But nothing like this occurs  in a vacuum. You can't be totally  oblivious. You must suspect something.  You're doing things which are making  people angry. People who have been  in power a long time are losing their  jobs. You know them better than me.  How much does it mean to them?  How  far would they go to hang onto it? There's only one way to find out for  sure. Try to cancel the last speech. It's the last chance they have for  me to kill you. Try to get out of  it. They won't let you. They can't.  Try to change the schedule and you'll  know I'm right. What have you got to  lose? It comes down to who you trust,  them or me? Test them. This? I've never even fired one. What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!? I don't know. I don't know. I have to get back. This is about power and you haven't  got any. There's nothing more you  can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying. Where is he? In the john. Get moving. You' oughta learn to relax. I told  you I've got it under control. It's time. It's time now. Out of there, Mr. Watson! Your time's  up! You forgot to wash your hands. I've got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I  know you're not just a regular guy,  see, I know that. Even if you don't  know it yourself. Maybe that's why I  picked you. I know what I have to do. I'll do  it. Let's go. Hey, El, how's the head? Eleanor. It's an important speech. I'd say critical, not that it's any  of my business. Excuse me. I'll trot along. Nice to see you,  Eleanor. During a campaign every speech is  important. This is free media  exposure. Primetime news coverage  that we couldn't buy. Who, him? Just visiting. He's my friend. And he did help you  to get elected, after all. What happened here? Eleanor, please. I'll put it this  way. This speech or a half-dozen  rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do  you say? Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll  get you some Pepto, you'll make one  of your patented tributes to the  common person, then back to  Sacramento. This is no time to lay  down on the job. I don't care what  the polls say, you can't afford to  relax. Look what happened to Bush.  Tell you what, if you want to blow  off the Sacramento speech, fine. But  do this one and we'll get out of the  smog. That's my girl. Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand. I've been a bad boy. Ladies, gentlemen, it is my great  pleasure to introduce to you the  esteemed spouse of our Governor.  Let's give a big L.A. welcome to Mr.  Brendan Grant. Ladies and gentlemen of the press,  campaign volunteers, and those of  you who were looking for any excuse  to take off work for the afternoon... We have with us today the first woman  Governor of our great state... Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. What  can I say about her....that won't  get me in trouble when I get home  tonight. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, are you  reading me? She's a woman who loves our great  state. Charlie... I can't get shit on this stupid radio. A brilliant legislator. ...who will soon win her second term  as the greatest Governor California  has ever seen! Somebody's going to ave to run down  to the truck. Tell them this radio's  fucked. I can't get through. Walkie-Talkies  don't work from here. There's too  much concrete and stuff. Ladies and gentlemen... Nothin's getting out. I am honored to present to you our  esteemed Governor and my beloved  wife, Eleanor Samara Grant! Look out! Look out! Look out! My God, he did it! You little son of a bitch. I'd be better if they'd put sleeves  on these damn vests. Daddy blew it. Very good...Mr. Watson. I told  them...I could make a killer out of  you. Lost my watch. For what? Believe me, I don't blame you. This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello. Can we go now? No, that's... That's OK. We don't  need any help. We'll be just fine.  Won't we, Lynn? Same to you. Thanks for the shine. Come on, kid. I gotta make a phone  call.
