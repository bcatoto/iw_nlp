I've been a bad boy. Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand. That's my girl. Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog. What happened here? Who, him? Just visiting. During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy. It's an important speech.Oh, yeah? The grave. Somebody close? Somebody close? Aw, too bad. Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What? 'S okay. What do you think? Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego. It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops. Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money. Where'd you come from? Business or pleasure? You just come in on Amtrack? Amtrack? Where to, sir?Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem... What? I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave. Huh? Sorry. San Diego. Business. Uh, yes.. What? The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is? Same to you. No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn? Can we go now? Believe me, I don't blame you. This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello. For what? This? I've never even fired one. It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them. There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech. I knew you wouldn't believe me. And your husband works for somebody else. I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband. No. I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun. It was because I had this...in my pocket That's right. Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant. I have a problem. If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already. I appreciate that. Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you. She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph. I... Its'...ah...about my daughter.... I need your help. What? Walk out there and twist her arm off? What are you going to do about it, shoot me? I talk to her or you can forget about it. I want'to talk to her. Let me talk to her again. One thirty. California Ballroom. No, please... How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone? How am I supposed to get away? Even if you don't, Her Security men will. I kill her - and you kill me. I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work. I killed you. You killed him. How should I...? He's dead? What...? What would you do in my place? Then I have time for a drink. It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it. The gun... Where did you get these? Who are you? This says "invitation only". At one thirty my little girl is dead. I will do no such thing. You're out of your mind. Yes, I'm listening. Yes, yes, I understand. You wouldn't... Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends. Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl! I'd like to know what... Yes. Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near... What? We have to hurry. Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him? I think you better put that away. Okay... But... Are you sure? The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter. You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me. No! You can't! They're in on it. Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me. You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me. My wife always said I had a problem trusting people. No, that's,..that's fine No. Kisses to you. All right. Kisses to you. Will you promise me that? He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you. No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right? Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do. I know you do, honey. Yes, sweetie, it's me. Over and out. Yes. Yes, I can hear you. Lynn! Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right? Let' s do it. Ready? How did you see us kiss? So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that? You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that? Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that? We made it. I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me? Thanks for the shine. This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying. I don't know. What am I supposed to say to her? What!? Yeah. Thank you. Hi. Keep the change. What are you going to do? I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that. So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it.... It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter. That's just what I thought I was supposed to do. It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl. No way, there's nothing you can do to help me. The Governor. If I could just talk to her... One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it. Kill the Governor. There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her. My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them. That's right. What? I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect... Please... Please. Something is going to happen... Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about. You remember me? Can I get out to Flower Street from here? Keep it. Keep it. Is within himself. I said I have to do something. I have to do something. I'm just an accountant.Thanks for the tip. What are you going to do!? What are you going to do now? Well? It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment. You're going to go see her. You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing. Irene is going to help. Meet Irene. Don't think I won't. Yeah, now listen. I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you. Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time? Yeah, all right, listen... Then why'd you drag me into it? Oh, Jesus ... Who? I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation? What are you supposed to do? In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom. Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off. This gorilla's watching you, is that right? Cover your mouth. Mister, what are you dragging me into? Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change? You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty? What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair. Oh, man... I remember. The big tipper. Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there. It's a twenty. You got anything smaller? I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail. What's that? You have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps. Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants? They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right? What do you do, if I may be so bold? Gimme a dollar. Oh, we'll have to do better than that. I think this is worth a dollar. I don't think so. You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild? It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now. Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs. You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned. Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.You know what I'm gonna do. Don't you threaten me. Forget about it. No. ...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together. That's right. That gives you... Again. Come back. That's not my problem, Mr. Watson Keep your voice down. Do you now, Mr. Watson? You fucked up. That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved. Tell me why he's dead. That's right. He's dead. Tell me why. Tell me why I miss him. Me? You get another chance in ten minutes. You... What about the gun? Are you 'fucking with me!? I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving. This'11 get you in anywhere.

You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control. Shut up. Help me get her off the rug. It's under control. Yeah. Just put her on. Put her on. Come Back. Do it! That's enough. You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead. Do it. You're wasting time. God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her. And what happens if I don't call you?
