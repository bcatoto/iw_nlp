Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the future of Los Angeles! The Arroyo Seco freeway is just the beginning.  We're planning freeways from Downtown to Santa Monica, from the South Bay to the San Fernando Valley.  Twenty minutes to work or play is the longest you'll have to travel. How many bodies you think Mickey Cohen'll be able to hide in all that cement? We're selling an image, gentlemen. Beautiful weather.  Affordable housing. Trouble-free transportation.  And the best police department in the world to keep it all running smoothly. My name?  Joe Reno.  The city? Los Angeles.  A big town.  Full of all sorts of people.  It's my job to help them.  I like what I do. I'm a cop. But with a second rate Al Capone out there, L.A. looks like Chicago in the '30s.  Something has to be done. Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest. Bullshit.  What's the charge? Non-payment of federal income tax. How's your bullshit now, Mickey?! And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. Bud ain't in the mood for small talk, Stompanato. Happy New Year, greaseball. Leave it for later, Bud.  We got to pick up the rest of the booze and get back to the precinct. Central, this is 4A-31.  Send a prowler to 1486 Evergreen.  White male in custody.  Code 623 point one.  Domestic assault and battery.  I won't be here, but they'll see him. Touch her again and I'll know about it.  Understand?  Huh? You got someplace you can go? Go get yourself fixed up. You and women, partner.  What's next?  Kids and dogs? Let's go someplace quiet.  I'll give you the low-down on Mitchum. Two sets. Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Is she? You lost me, Sid.  Who? I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station. No.  It's felony possession of marijuana. Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns. Police! Yeah, it's subtle. A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself. With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir. Of his penis, sir? Sounds like a helluva party. You want it delivered? I'll be right with you, Lynn. Merry Christmas. That obvious, huh? Get lost why don't you? I got a license for that. Cut me some slack.  I used to be a cop. Turner Meeks?  Never heard of you. You okay? I'm not asking you. Somebody hit you? What is it then? What's going on? You know him? Seen him around.  He used to be a cop. Captain Smith, I -- Drop the formalities; it's Christmas Eve.  Call me Dudley. Dudley, I came up with a title for the story.  I'm calling it "Silent Night with the L.A.P.D." Excellent.  How's this? The sanctity of the night is an invitation to the darker criminal element.  Our vigilance will not be diminished. That's Smith with an S. This way, gentlemen. Two police officers were assaulted in a bar.  Brown and Helenowski. This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of the legendary Preston Exley.  He's the watch commander tonight and a damn fine job. I was fortunate enough to be partnered with his father when I was a rookie.  It makes a man feel old.  That's a fact. Feel free to get a feel for the place. A word with you, lad. To the memory of your father. The day he got the Medal of Valor. A simpler time. That was his favorite toast. I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three. You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division? You don't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective. Or the stomach.  You're a political animal, Edmund. Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment? Answer yes or no. Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund. Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty? Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance -- Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau. At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them. Hey, partner.  Grab a cup. I got to write my report first. Hear about Helenowski and Brown? They got into a helluva scrap with six taco benders at some bar. Helenowski lost six pints of blood.  Brown's in a coma. We ought to teach Paco and his friends a lesson. Hi... I'd like to get a delivery to Beverly Hills. Look, a friend of mine gave me this number.  I just -- Pacific Coast Bell. This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine. Please hold the line... No such number is assigned. I just called it. No, Sergeant.  I checked twice. A bootleg... Fucking Exley.  Guy's got a pole so far up his ass, every time he farts the flag waves. They got the spics who japped Helenowski and Brown.  Helenowski lost an eye and Brown's got brain damage. For ours, Pancho. And you're getting off easy. White, you better get a lease on Stens before he kills someone. Fuck you, Yeah yeah... And fuck your mother too. Officer White, you've refused to cooperate with Internal Affairs. But you should know this is bigger than a police board.  Indictments may be handed down.  Quite frankly, we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department's image.  Will you testify? No, sir.  I won't. District Attorney Loew. I won't do it. I won't testify against my partner or anyone else. Your badge and gun, Officer. This is the new L.A.P.D., White. You're suspended from duty and dismissed. Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation? Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer. No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time. I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately. Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33. That'll be hard to come by.  The men hate a turncoat. All right, Ed. Call Sergeant Vincennes. You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department? So be it. Sergeant, we'll get right to it. Nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia. What do I have to do? I'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist.  A brief suspension followed by a temporary transfer from Narcotics to Ad Vice. When you transfer out of Vice, you'll be back on the show. The show, sir? Badge of Honor, Vincennes.  We need to tone down your profile for a bit. John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now. Okay.  I'll do it. Dismissed, Vincennes. So be it. Ace them at the grand jury tomorrow, son.  Wear the smart- looking suit and ace them.  And, Ed?  Lose the glasses. You're the key witness? I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you? Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff? You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs. I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart. Edmund J. Exley to chambers. Just remember, Bud White'll fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life.  They already suspended him.  Just pray he cops a deal and stays on the Department because that is one civilian you do not want on your case. That an old fashioned you're drinking? My name's Bud. They stick you with a name like Wendell, you look for an alias. I'm sorta between jobs.  Look, what do you say we, uh... Lad, may I have a word with you? This business, Captain? Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables. Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off? He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective. Captain, what do you want? Call me Dudley. Dudley, what do you want? Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell? Yeah, I hate them. And for good reason judging from what I know of your background. What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this. It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell? He helped me out once.  That's all. Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing. Him and me both. Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself Wendell, I want you to come to work for me. Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn? They're yours.  Take them. I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me? Four of the defendants recanted their testimony. How? I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide. Homicide?  A detective? Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.  It's a muscle job and shooting job.  You'll do what I say and not ask questions.  Do you follow my drift? In Technicolor. Will you work for me? Of course... But how? How what, Wendell? How'd you get them to retract? I'm not a policeman.  I just play one on television.  But I think I can answer for them.  To help people.  That's why I do the show. To protect and serve.  It's not just a motto. That one.  In the sweater. They also serve who only stand and wait. Jack, I'll see you Monday on set. I won't be there.  They're toning down my profile. Domestic.  Assault and battery. Ready to go, Bud? I'll be there in five minutes. I hear you like to hit women. My wife.  She's dropping charges so it's none of your business. What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?! I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny? And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me? Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper! Picture-book smut, gentlemen. There's been a bunch of it found at collateral crime scenes lately. Mostly narcotics and prostitution collars. Look who's back from suspension. We're honored, Sergeant Jack. Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953. Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be? Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics. Oh?  Anyplace else? Working whores with squad two. Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one. They're yours.  Make a major case, Sergeant.  It's the only way you're getting out of here. Dismissed, gentlemen. Roll, Vincennes.  No sidetracks. This is Ad Vice, not Narco. Sid, it's Vincennes. No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice. Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something. What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.' Park Rangers report three Negro youths discharging shotguns into the air in Griffith Park. Suspects are driving a late model purple Mercury Coupe. You should stay away from a man when his blood is up. Then maybe you should stay away from him all the time. Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good. Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer? Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight. What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing? No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming. What are you talking about? It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. Squad call!  Nite Owl Coffee Shop One-eight-one-two-four Cherokee! Multiple homicides!  Multiple homicides!  Code three! Loads of people down.  Men. Women.  I stopped for coffee -- Holy shit fuck... S-s-sir, there's a captain outside wants to see you. Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it. It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command. We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice. Why? Get on it. We got an I.D. on one of the victims, sir... I think it's Dick Stensland. With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los Angeles is organized crime free. The Chief wants it to stay that way, Edmund.  The means are not for the weak-hearted. Come, Wendell, you can do better than that. We know all that, lad.  Tell us, who do these shooters work for? We want you to go home. Uncuff him, Michael. Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark from San Francisco.  He arrived this afternoon at Union Station. Looking for business opportunities in our fair city.  An organized crime associate in need of re- education in the ways of polite society. It's part of the play, Edmund.  A sincerity test. Sit him back down. Wendell, you need to accompany Detective Lieutenant Exley on official police business.  I'll finish up here. Where are we going? Call me crazy, but for a second I thought it was Rita Hayworth. Yeah, that's Stens. What happened? Is this your daughter, Mrs. Lefferts? 'Nite Owl Massacre.'  Hyperbole aside, this is a heinous crime that requires a swift resolution. The public will demand it and this department will provide it.  Six victims.  One of them, one of our own -- Dick Stensland. As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular.  In the wrong place at the wrong time. Robbery looks like the motive.  We have rubber glove prints on the register and preliminary forensics strongly lean toward a trio of gunmen.  We do have one hot lead, so listen well.  Three Negro youths were seen last night discharging shotguns in the air at Griffith Park. A park ranger I.D.ed them as driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury Coupe, purple in color.  An hour ago, a canvassing crew found a news vendor who saw a purple Merc Coupe parked across from the Nite Owl around 3:00 A.M. The D.M.V. worked all night to get us a registration list on '48 to '50 purple Mercs.  There are 142 registered to Negroes in L.A. County.  Fifty two-man teams will shake three names apiece.  Hot suspects you'll bring here. Interrogation rooms have been set up.  They'll be run by Lieutenant Edmund Exley.  Hollywood Squad. Enough on that.  Gentlemen, just go out and get them.  Use all necessary force.  The people of Los Angeles demand it. Can you take them?  I got I got something I gotta do. Christ, I don't know.  What if one of these names... What I gotta do is for Stensland. My partner. Where to, Trash? If we go by the list, we have about zero chance of making the collar.  But I know a guy who knows what's going on south of Jefferson.  I'm betting he could put us at 50/50. I don't know... Between the two of you guys, you should bring along a photographer. I need an address on a customer of yours.  Her name was Lynn. That's all I have to go on? Yeah.  And I think you already know who I mean, so cough it up. Lynn Bracken.  There's a billing address and a delivery address. Give me both.  Billing first. You must slay 'em at the country club. Are you Pierce Patchett? I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night? Richard Stensland. Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her? We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go. Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating. Everything alright, Mr. Patchett? Where's the other guy?  Buzz. Thanks, but no thanks. I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come? No. That's right. Why were Lefferts' eyes black? You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially? What little studio? That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ. I got her address. Is it the cops? Leonard Bidwell? How's the left these days? What's it to you? I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style. What do you want, Mr. Policeman? You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there. Till 19-fucking-70. How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A. We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe. You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket? You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here. He's bad, so I'll just tell you. Sugar Ray Coates.  Drives a '49 coupe, a beautiful ride.  Don't know about shotguns, but he gets his thrills killing dogs.  He is righteous trash. That's five minutes from here. I don't understand, doll, we just got started. Gosh, kitten, I don't know... Hit the road, gramps. Alright.  This time I'll go, but next time -- L.A.P.D., shitbird.  Get the fuck out of here or I'll call your wife to come get you. Yeah, plain scotch. Are you sorry she's dead? Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland? You use words like that, you might make me mad. Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention. Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl? Did Lefferts have a boyfriend? How'd she meet Patchett? Tell me about Patchett. You want some advice, Miss Bracken? Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears. Maybe I'm just fucking curious. You fuck for money. Yeah. When they deserve it. I'm not sure. Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today. You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake? Look.  I want to see you again. I don't know. Forget I asked.  It was a mistake. Hey. What the fuck are you guys doing here? What do you got? So long, Vice.  Badge of Honor, here I come. Fuck you, Vincennes.  It's our collar. What? Just don't shoot me. Freeze! Ace him, Jack. Ed, I want confessions. You think golden boy can handle it, Cap? I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of. Say what and so what. Man, why do you keep asking me that? I never truck with no sissies! Believed what? Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business. Larry gave it at Casitas!  Man, I was the fuckin' boss jocker on my dorm!  Larry's the sissy! Larry gave it for candy bars! You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog. Dogs got no reason to live. Man, what're you saying? I don't own no shotguns. Say what? I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge. Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me. Roland Navarette.  Lives on Bunker Hill.  He runs a hole-up for parole absconders and sells red devils. Masterful, Edmund.  Your father would've been proud. This one's on the verge. Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl. This newspaper shit ain't shit. I think she's alive. He's good.  I'll give him that. One in six.  Where's the girl? S-sylvester F-fitch one-o-nine and Avalon gray corner house... Give me one minute. You've got it, Wendell. We're going through the front. Get her to the fucking hospital. Get the fuck away from me. It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got. Repeat, three suspects escaped from the Hall of Justice jail. The Nite Owl killers:  Raymond Coates, Tyrone Jones and Larry Fontaine.  They are considered armed and extremely dangerous. Descriptions are as follows... Is something up, Lieutenant? We mourn the passing of a good man.  The loss of Sgt. William Carlisle is the loss of his wife, his family and the entire Los Angeles Police Department... You tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention of changing my vote. It may surprise some, but a mature man, enlightened by the facts, can change him mind... Edmund J. Exley has amassed a brilliant record in his seven years with the L.A.P.D.  Recently he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty.  It is my honor to present him with our highest honor, the Medal of Valor. Your father would've been proud. There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter. Breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind.  A little self-doubt? It's natural.  Just keep it inside.  Between you and you. This election is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles. Ellis Loew represents that future. So dig deep and let's get a moral man re-elected. Sid, how are they hanging? What's he doing here, Sid? Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke. And Reynolds? Have we met before? Yeah. Was it a party? Something like that. Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right? Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.' Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all. Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back. Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too. Really?  How? You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up. Yeah.  Me neither. I don't know if I should do this. Loew's free.  Congratulate him. Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers? Around. I can't do it. I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz. And no one'll know about this? It'll be our secret. Showbiz. Where did you intend to start. Prostitution?  Gambling? Go back to Cleveland, lad.  This is the City of Angels and you haven't got any wings. It's Bud. Come on, Sid.  Where are you? It's Vincennes!  Open up! Sid, cut the crap.  I -- Shut up! He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat. Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure? What'll it be, Jack? A bottle of Scotch. Hey!  Your change! Who was that guy who was here earlier? When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way. Yeah.  But not for long. I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective... There's something wrong with the Nite Owl.  That prick Exley shot the wrong guys.  But they made him a hero and whoever killed my partner is still out there. In here I know it.  But I can't prove it.  I'm not a detective. I'm not smart enough.  I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless. That simple, huh? I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean. More or less. I asked my men, Lieutenant.  No one remembers any colored guys firing shotguns. Not us. Bud White, what brings you down to the basement? I got a few Nite Owl questions. I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed. I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes. What do you want to know? Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense. You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything. Whose shoe? Susan Lefferts. If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood? It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away. But she's moving away from the door. Who was sitting at this table? Dick Stensland. Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right? You know, there is one thing. Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door. Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears. It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic. What do you mean? It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in... Yeah, so... Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions. Five minutes.  That's all. Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue. Ma'am, I'm sure she was. What was that boyfriend's name? Stens?  Was it Stens? Look at a picture for me. You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside? What's through here? Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus. Buzz Meeks... Holy shit. Yeah.  A great big one. Here.  Compliments of the Los Angeles Police Department. Hey, just in time for our stomach of the week.  Frankfurters with sauerkraut, French fries, Coca-Cola, alcohol and sperm. Jesus, what a last supper. Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away. Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought. Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett. Please hold, Sergeant... Give me a minute, will ya? Damnit... Even I'm not that crazy. Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor. Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone. Yeah.  My whole life. I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession. What? You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, Is there more to that, or do I have to guess? So what's the point? I don't remember... I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant. Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar. I ain't your You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett. His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill. More. How 'bout I give you your balls back? Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin? He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny? He's in the Brown Derby with Johnny Stompanato. Check that.  I gotta go. Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead. Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all. Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again. High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him? She is Lana Turner. She Guy's as cool as they come. Ray Pinker wants to talk to you, Lieutenant.  Says he has your I.D. What are you going to do? Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner. God bless dental records.  Stiff used to be a cop.  Turner Meeks. You knew him? Of him.  He was around when I first joined the force.  A bad egg. Come on, Exley.  Where are you? John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad. Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important. Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara. You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley? A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him? Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it. What's this all about, lad? Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it. You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund? It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends. Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice. Have you discussed this with anyone else, John? No. Not even with Exley? Have you a valediction, lad? Rollo Tomasi... Sergeant Vincennes' body was found in Echo Park at ten o'clock this morning.  Killed by a single .38 round to the heart.  One of our own, gentlemen.  We cannot tolerate it.  Justice must be swift and merciless.  That's all. Edmund, a word with you.  We received a tip this morning.  Did Vincennes ever mention the name Rollo Tomasi? Anonymous.  Probably nothing. You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp. What work? I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad. You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about. You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you? Sure, boss.  Sure you can. An ex-cop.  Buzz Meeks.  I pulled his police academy photo. I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general. This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell. It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes? But you were business associates? Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett. Wendell.  I want full and docile cooperation on all topics. And? Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships. And? Wendell! I wouldn't trade places with Edmund Exley right now for all the tea in China. Hush-hush... Nothing. Someone must've pulled the records. I don't have time.  I have -- Did you talk to Exley? I want to know about Exley. How'd you get to know so much about him? You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley? So tell me about it. No.  Now. You fucked him. Lynn. I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them. Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot. Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house. The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down. Somebody got wind of it, killed them all. Dudley. Dudley's guys. It all keeps coming back to Dudley. Let's just kill them. For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice. There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down. Which one are you and which one am Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle. Come on. He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken. At least not anymore. Call him. We took her to Hollywood Station for safekeeping.  Someone worked her over pretty good.  She wouldn't say who. You got it, Exley.  And now we're even. What about him? Dudley Smith.  Spill. If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all. They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two. You do it.  I'll check the files. I got your guns, Bud.  Signed in April 3rd, 1950.  Remember the First Western bank robbery?  They were used in that. I want to see them. No can do.  I can't find them. You wanted to meet here? Too late. Here. A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end. I spent years trying not to live down to mine. We should block off the bathroom. They could come through -- I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund. Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history. A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides. Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people. This isn't politics, Edmund. There won't be winners and losers when it's over... Just the living and the dead. It's always been that way in the Bureau.  You should've realized that before you became a detective. We're policemen! Let me do the talking.  They'll make you Chief of Detectives. Why not, lad?  Absolute justice? Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty? Are you willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance they'll -- You have a lot of explaining to do, Lieutenant. When in doubt, feed them a hero. In this case, we'll need more than one. Captain Edmund Exley.  Chief of Detectives.  Los Angeles Police Department.
