Well, I didn't know they was a secret club. Well, nobody put a gun to his head. I'll get right on it. Heat is heat. They got heat in Michigan.Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her. Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge. It clearly states in the will -- Apparently just before her death. Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.I said NO! Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that. Why are there two deeds here? Doesn't matter. Move on. We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian. Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom. Oh Jesus. SO! It's not that long. We were here two Christmases ago. Then we should have had lunch at the bank. I nearly died when we split the bill. What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you. Carolyn! Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?" Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean. Nobody did. Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage. I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here. Not yet. You want to go? I bet mom could've helped her. He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff. I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road? Bar across the street. Then why do you? I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis. Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife. He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us. No. We're going to lock this up and -- This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was. That's it! Grateful!? I can't believe she's making jokes. How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope? Well, what am I supposed to think? Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --! This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it. You think she had sex with him? Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...? DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die? What? Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him. What's he saying now? Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away! What?! Yeah. Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray. What problem? I thought everything WAS arranged. He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve? Lawyer here? Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office? Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer. Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice. Okay. Betty. Okay. Nah. Who the hell is Lucy Delaney? WHAT! I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh? Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated. When did she decide this? Cremated?!What about your husband? What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon? Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much. Franny? Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make? I'm going to miss you. Frannie. Again? Maybe you should see a doctor. Now?! It's after eleven. Where you going? What time is it? 'Bout 4:30. Sure. Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing? You feeling better Franny?I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind. I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now. But now that you have it - TO HELL WITH YOU! Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!? Yeah. It could get better. What about us? What about me? The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you. Then he can move! People move! For who? If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize. BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU! I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU! I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong. I told you! I won't apologize for who I am. STOP IT! What do you want me to say? Stop it! How do you know what I experience? What are you doing? I was honest with you. I told you who I was. Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband. Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is - I... What do you want? What? Yes, thanks. Am I too heavy for you? I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden. Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out. Uh-huh. And? You're somewhere else, where? Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. I can't do this, honey. I had a temper. Trouble. Why? No, I don't mind. Because I already tried once. No. I couldn't. He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments. Near the church. I sat outside and had coffee. Nobody's asking you to. Why? It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God. You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas... Have you ever been to that station? How about Bari? How about Italy? What? No. You want to eat something? Are you comfortable? Do you... want to move to the bedroom? Would you like a beer for your bath? How about if I set the table? Can I help? Couple. Want to help? Oh, how is he? Yeah? I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage. Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... The cashier at the general store was very dangerous. I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that. Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea. It's Robert. Okay. See you later. I'll pick you up. Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested... I would love to come for dinner. I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot. Am I interrupting anything? Francesca? No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask. I already apologized. I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions. My mistake. I apologize. Do you want to leave your husband? I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie. That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper. No. But I love them just the same. I told you, I love other people. Not everybody's supposed to have a family. No. I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind. No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly. I'm a loner, I'm not a monk. Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want. I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break. Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much. We're not doing anything wrong, do you. Francesca? Are you all right? Francesca? You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes? I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is... ... so much beauty. This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that? You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out. You want to go back in? You get used to it. No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away. Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root. They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband. This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull. I'm sorry. That was... You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you? Do you miss it? Why did you stop? And did you? Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on. Did you love teaching? No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal. I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions. I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually. Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures. We got engaged. It's still a very sensitive memory for me. She starts sniffing me. Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know. That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks. You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me. Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt. I better go. You sure you're all right? It's been a pleasure. Sincerely. Is the dizziness gone? Feeling better? And clean. Clean? What's he like? Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change. I doubt that. Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure. Must be nice having kids. No, your kids. Oh. How old? As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family? A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet. I thought it was funny. Sure you want to keep those in the house? Mind if I smoke? Sure. Francesca. Robert. Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson. Want another cigarette? I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute... Here it is. Are you by nature a sadistic person? WHAT! Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I? Oh! You caught me. Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one? This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work. Yeah. So, how long you've been living here? Yeah. Excuse me a sec. Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country. Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there. Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story! Whereabouts in Italy? You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so. How long you been married? After the divorce. Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married. That must be it. It's a great smell. I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it? There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean? Pretty country. If I'm not taking you away from anything. Oh, terrific. Which way? That's it. Yeah.
