Don't move! It's not cool. It's commie bullshit! You think it's cool? Cool? Listen to this bullshit. "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."Secret Service! It's cool! Yeah, cool. Now that's cool. Alright sir. I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files. It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.How are you going to take care of the cops? That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal. See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show. Let's keep her. Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait! And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap... As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder. Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters. Hack the Planet!Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth. Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something. Right. Shh! So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight? Yeah but oh man, wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh! Oh yeah? What's that? What's that? What's that? A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens. Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus? Snoop onto them... Ta-da! That's far out! Oh man. That's universally stupid, man! Looks like a hacker wrote it. Hold on a second! Super hero like even. Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo! Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight? Difficulty rating? Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark. Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho. I'm gonna hit you! It was him, man! Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff? Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing. Stupid, man. It's universally stupid. ...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks. Roger. Yeah? Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright? Well this hasn't happened yet. You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six. Oh wow, we are fried. Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things. What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.What? I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry. The sensitive type. Was that her top? Shit! What is it with this guy? Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door. The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf. Dragon book. Compiler design. Devil book. The Unix Bible. Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date. Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus. Dead. Yeah? Display? Did you talk to him? You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is? And what's he do? Who's that? Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass. No. No one special. Revenge. Hmmm. Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin! Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet. Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please? Mm-hmm. I'm taking over a TV network. Yeah, mom? I found it! I found it! Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole. I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone. You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you. That's bullshit. I told you, I don't play well with others. Blow me. Shit! Come on! Nah. I don't play well with others. I'm sorry. Who are you? We did it! Oh, shit! He got me. Okay. Let's go shopping. Fucked if I care, man. And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about... It nibbles. You see this? This isn't a virus. It's a worm! Burn! How did you know that? Razor and Blade. What's going on? No. Crash Override. You know, I've been having these really weird.. They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite. Wanna go for a swim? You look good in a dress. Yeah. What? I'm trying to help you. Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time. Yeah. It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money. Razor and Blade! They're flakes! Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson. Shit!! I'll hack the Gibson. I'll make it up to you! I got a record. I was Zero Cool. I didn't know what was on it. This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me. I know, I know who wrote it. Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started. And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around. This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas. I have to tell you something. Kate, listen. Okay. I'll copy it. I'm sorry, I can't. Do my ears deceive me? And you have to smile. Make it our first date. And if I win? Your slave? Name your stakes. Yeah. You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste? Yeah. RISC is good. Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that. It has a killer refresh rate. Yeah? It's cool, I'm just looking. I'm Crash Override. Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV! I said give me time. Pool on the roof must have a leak. I'll give it a shot. That's a nice score for a girl. Yeah! Sure. My... class. You mean I'm not in your class? It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there... Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques. Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem? Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari... Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers? Homicidal? Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office. Excuse me.The System Command Processor, it's the brain. A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer. It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do? There's a new virus in the database. The rabbit is in the administration system. We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files. I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23. Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker. Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net. Mr. Belford?I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me? Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know. Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from... Love, secret, and uh, sex. But not in that order, necessarily, right? You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right? Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around... Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh? I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle. What? whatwhatwhat? Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...What's up, man? I'm the Phreak! So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual? Sorry, I can't help you, okay? Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.Damn! Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts. ...as they snoop onto us. Yo, brain dead, the manual! This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha! Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit! Yo, man, you an amateur, man. Look at this, it's so lean and clean. Very impressive. I want it. Again? Yeah sure. Yes! Joey's getting stupid busy. Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man. Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes. They'll trace you like that man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun. Two days. What's this one eat? Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software! I got photographic memory. It's a curse! Lisa! Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM! That's Razor and Blade. Yo, showtime, showtime! Never heard of you. Done anything?212-555-4240. Uhhhmm... Uhhh.. ahahaha... Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh... Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.Just one moment. What number please? Hello, operator services. Thank you.One-handed! Yo, hit the lights. I want it to have my children! Do you think he could hack a Gibson? His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust? You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit. Cereal, man, you owe me a pack. Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron? Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit. What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything? Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things. Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round. Dead? Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem! Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes. He isn't to consort with his computer friends. The secret service is really out to get him. Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go? No, don't know who he is. Do you? That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day. Curtis. Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man. Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on. Yo, what's up? Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords? D'you bring those Crayola books? You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless. You know, you're right about that. Check it, Friday. One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it... Joey, Joey... Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time? I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys. Hey, it's me. Any questions? Relax, Burn, he's my guest. I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop! Thank you. 555-4202. Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number. Nonono, thank YOU!This is the end, my friend. Thank you for calling! Give it up! Just give it up. Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence. You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit. Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay? Talk to me. Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them! What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched. Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears. Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file. The girl. The girl has the disc I need. Thank you! I'm fine. Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay? Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love. I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies? Loser. I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you. What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again! Good. Hello? Gill. Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it. Gill. No. He's either very smart or very stupid. Die, dickweeds! Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display! Let's echo 23, see what's up. Never fear. I is here. As in what, you hapless techno-weenie? My name is the Plague. Send a Flu-shot. Nothing, it's just a minor glitch. No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money. Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away. Not everything. But enough to implicate us. So, we get the mother, we get the boy. From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm. The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans. I just hacked into it. I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC. Sh, sh sh sh sh. Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm. Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars. I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own. I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file. Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it. The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility. Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks. A hacker planted the virus. Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love, sex, secret and... ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password? Once again, don't call me Eugene. A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.Hackers of the World, Unite! She's rabid, but cute. Waste the dude. ...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons! Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back! Welcome to our show!
