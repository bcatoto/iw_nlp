What time is it? This milk is bad. Tuesday? I don't know. What's today? Nothing closer? Is it that bad? This is the worst fucking coffee  I've had in my life. What're we doing today? "Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks  to Mom." Any nudity? I'll do it. I like Ellen. Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse  in that Richard Gere movie. I worked on that. The shower scene. Start with the 5K in the window. Run  feeders for three blonds into the  living room. Two people. Sitting? Standing? Who fuckin' knows? "Ellen talks to Mom." Tired? "Ellen talks to Mom." No. It's on the callsheet. You're going to yell at each other? Problems with your own mom? You were great in that Richard Gere  movie. Look, I'm not blaming anybody, Wanda.  I'm just saying we left last night  and I knew we didn't get that scene. It was OK; and it's going to be  alright. But I'm not settling for OK  today. This is a big scene and I'm  not leaving till we get it. Alright, here's what I'm thinking.  Wolf, I want to do the whole scene  in one shot. It's been done. I know that but I'd like to try it  anyway. Handheld. No, dolly. We go from Close-up to  Wide-shot and back to Close-up in  the same shot. I'll use the 35, minimize distortion;  I'll light it all from the ceiling.  It could be kind of great. I'll need to see a couple run- throughs. Not too many. It's a tough scene for  the actors. I want them to feel  relaxed, fresh... I don't know how you drink that shit  black, Nick. I got to dump in the  milk. It's the only way I can cut  the taste. Jesus! What the fuck?! OK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing  fine. Remember, really listen and  really answer. I've got nothing to say to you. Just  let it happen. It's all there. Look at this a second, Nick. I pushed in a foot. She's incredible.  It's coming right through the lens. That's great, man. Beautiful. Let's go. Right away. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take one. Action. Cut! Boom in. Sorry, I had to cut.  Les, your boom was all the way in  the shot. Well, where's the frame line? I guess so. Beautiful; both of you. Stay focused.  Stay with it. No big deal. Let's go,  Wanda. Right away. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take two. And, action. I'm sorry, I have to cut. I was  completely off on the focus. It's my  fault, I'm sorry. I've got it now. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take three. And, action. Street noise! Jesus Christ. Why doesn't the guy  just get a flatbed trailer with about  600 speakers on it and tow it behind  his car. And... it's clear. kkkkkssst... sttttss yes. ssssssssssssppppkkss. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take four. Action. Boom's in. Jesus Christ. Where? The whole left side of frame, Les. The frame keeps changing. That's the idea, Les. May I make a suggestion? Is it  possible to maybe break the shot  down? Maybe two shots instead? Might  make it easier for Les. No. Then I need ten minutes to switch to  radio mikes. There won't be any other sound  problems? No more boom problems. Switch to radios. Get me a coffee. Half milk. I'm sorry about all this, Nicole. Not unless I change the shot; do a  cutaway of Cora or something and  intercut the takes. I don't want to  do that. It's a really nice shot and  what you're doing is incredible. The radio mikes are going to make  everything easier. So, look. Take a  moment. Let all this shit go. We  don't roll till you're ready. How was she in that Richard Gere  movie? Her career really took off, didn't  it? She is nice; but I could do a better  job. It's a scrim. Two seconds, Wanda. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take five. Action. Jesus fucking Christ! Kill it. Kill it. Pull the plug.  Right there by your foot. Well, let's see. What do you think  is going to happen next, Cora? No, you're not. You're going in there  in two minutes and we are really  going to nail this scene. I know it.  I have no doubt about it. Nicole... One second! What's up? Wolf? You know how I feel; I love this  shot. Hell, I designed it. Then let's just stick with the game  plan, OK? It's a simple shot. We're  going to get it this time, I feel  it. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take six. Action. Cut. That's OK, Cora. What's the  line? Just say it to me; no acting. "Ellen, I have no memory of this  line whatsoever." "Ellen, I have no memory of this  whatsoever." Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take seven. Action. Cut. It's OK. No big deal. Everyone relax. We're just going to  run the lines. That's all. No acting.  Just run the lines. Then we're going  to shoot this fucking scene. And, action on the run-through. And action on the run-through. Roll camera... roll camera. Where's Wolf? In the bathroom... he doesn't feel  good. Get him! Get him! Where the fuck is Wolf?!!! One second! I've had to, well I've changed the  shot; we're just a little pressed  for time. It'll just be a CU of Ellen  for the last part of the scene,  starting with Cora's "I was worried  about Danny." OK? I'll find a way to  cut this into the fourth take. We  almost had it. That was unbelievable,  both of you. But let's not think  about it. That moment is gone, and...  we'll, we'll get another one. I have  no doubt about it. OK? Here we go. I'm ready, Nick. Call it, Wanda. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, Pickup, take one. Action. CUT!!!! It's not me. It's the camera. The fuck it is. It's off; it's not  even running. Then what the fuck is it!!? It's somebody's watch! Not mine. Not mine. Not mine. Where is it!! You motherfucker! You  cock-sucking motherfucking bastard!  Where the fuck are you!? Where!!  Where!! Can someone help me please?! Do I  have to do everything myself here?! Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn  your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you  finally going to pay attention here?!  Hey, focus puller, you want to make  a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got  some great fuckin' Thai Stick here!  Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret- wearing motherfucker! I saw your  reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell  would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda,  next time can you wear a shirt that's  a little more distracting to my  actors! Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make  a little more noise on the dolly you  creaky motherfucker! What is your name!? What do you  fucking do around here?! Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't  even find a teeny fucking beep?! See what I have to put up with,  Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do  some of that magic on camera!? But  no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking  his guts out, "Oh now I'll be good!!" God... Well, when did he ask you? What, the guy can't even check into  a hotel by himself? Well, how did it come up? I like jazz. Why are you wearing perfume to work? You didn't wear it yesterday. My eye! Do I look alright?! Should we call up to the room again? He said he'd be right down. Tired? I'm exhausted. I dreamt I was on the  set all night. I was just trying to  do one shot and everything kept going  wrong. That's an anxiety dream. Are you  anxious about something? I don't know. Sometimes I wonder  what the hell I'm doing in this  business. It's all just one compromise  and disappointment after another. I  don't know if I have the personality  for it. Sounds kind of like an identity  crisis. Maybe you're right. Who am I? What  am I really capable of? Maybe I should  just get a job teaching at a women's  college somewhere. How'd you get into cinematography? I'm not a cinematographer. You're not? No. I'm directing this movie. How'd you get into directing? They're waiting downstairs. Oh, OK. Listen, I've got to tell  you, I had a lot of fun last night,  really, but for me, where I'm at  right now in my life, a relationship  is... I just thought you might... Hey, that's not my style. So, I'll see you on the set. I got two films coming up right after  yours, Nick. One I play a rapist  that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love  with. The other I'm kind of a sexy  serial killer who shacks up with  Winona Ryder. That's great, man. Yeah, but I'm not into that hostess  twinkie shit, Nick. Hostess twinkie? That Hollywood shit. It's all fluff,  man. These are the kind of movies I  want to do, right here. I'm glad you feel that way, Chad.  And I just want to tell you, I'm  really happy we can work together. Hey, me too! You're a great director,  man. Your films are wacked! And I'm  gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a  hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick.  I'm gonna pick your brain. Good. Then you can pick my nose. See what I mean? You're wacked. Hey,  what are we sitting here for? We're waiting for Nicole. Nicole? She's takin' a tax -- What? Probably taking a shower or something.  Hey, how was her shower scene in  that Richard Gere movie? Good. Really great. I think we got nudity today. It just says "Scene Six: Ellen and  Damian kiss." Could be a kiss with nudity. I like Ellen. She's my type. Why is that? She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky. Maybe I'll give her a part. That's  right; I'm makin' my own movie pretty  soon. Oh yeah? Yup. Feature. I brought my script. Palomino's perfect for the lead. I'm  going to give it to him right during  lunch. Maybe right after. Alright. Got to be aggressive. You want to  shoot it? Sure. You ever shot anything? No. That's alright; got to start  somewhere. Jesus, what are you doing? Shrinking tissue. That's what this  stuff is for. Let that sit for two  minutes, pumpkin; I'll be right back. How'd you get here? Oh. We've been waiting in front of  your apartment for half an hour. You're just saying that because you  have Preparation H on your face. No you don't. I'm not. You really look beautiful. Hey! How'd you get here, Nicole? Oh, cause we were wondering how you  got here. Alright, good; everybody's here.  We'll do a run-through as soon as  you guys are ready. You got it, Chief. Great shirt, Wanda. OK, let's work out the rest of this  blocking. Wolf -- What happened to your eye? A little accident. You going to be alright? I think so. It looks good on you, man. Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're  there by the chair. Camera is close  on Ellen: her first line. Admired? That sounds rather  professional. Good! "Professional," that's the  cue; Damian steps up to the bed.  Camera pulls back. The scene  continues. It sounds like the champagne talking. Why didn't you tell me? God. And all this time I thought... Then the kiss. How's that feel? Great. Nicole? Wolf, any thoughts? Nope. I've got a thought. What about Damian  having an eyepatch like Wolf's? Let me think about that one, Chad. OK, you're the genius. Nick Reve,  Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take  One. Let's shoot it! One second, Chad. You ready for one,  Wolf? Hell, I been ready. Alright, Wolfman. Good. Call it, Wanda. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take one! And, action. Admired? That sounds rather  professional. It sounds like the champagne talking. Why didn't you tell me? God. And all this time I thought... Cut. Very good. Not for camera. Chad was completely  out of frame. Yeah, Chad; what happened, buddy?  Forget your cue? Oh no, man. I held back. It really  felt like something Damian would do;  holding back to the last moment. Oh, I see. How's that for you, Wolf? I don't care when he moves. Just  give me a fucking cue. The Lone Wolf! What line did he move on? "Why didn't you tell me?" Alright, "me" is the new cue. Nicole,  how does that feel to you? "Me, me, me," that's the cue. Let's  shoot; I'm stoked! One second, Chad. Chad, how would you describe this  scene, in one word? Great. It's a great scene, man. No, I mean it's a love scene. Right? Definitely. These two people really love each  other. And we want to see that,  especially in the kiss. Hey, say no more, Chief. Nicole? Good. Here we go. Call it, Wanda. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take two! And, action. Admired? That sounds rather  professional. It sounds like the champagne talking. Why didn't you tell me? God. And all this time I thought... And, cut. Very good. Wolf? Chad missed his cue again; the whole  dolly is unusable. Yeah, Chad. What happened; I thought  you were going to hold back till  "me"? The more I thought about it the more  it didn't seem right. And I'm  thinking, watch me here, instead of  coming around the bed, what if I  just slip here like this and do the  whole scene lying down? I don't know, that seems a little... Hey, I'm just throwing out ideas  here. Trying to get the juices  flowing. Nicole, how does that feel to you? Plus Chad is completely out of the  light down there. Hey, Wolf; I'm not worried about my  face, man. It's about the acting;  that's all I care about. It's your call, Nick. His acting or  his face. For some reason I was hoping we could  get both. I thought that's what we were trying  to do here. I'll have to set another light. Good, let's do it. Ellen, Damian;  let's talk for a second. OK, let's make sure we know what's  going on here. These two people have  loved each other for years, each of  them not knowing the other was in  love with them. And tonight, in this  little room it all comes out. It's  like a dam bursting. Does that make  sense? Nicole? What about you, Chad? I'm there, man. I got the dam going,  the river, everything. You watch,  that little change in the blocking  is going to open the whole scene up  for me. Good. Let's go. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take three! And, action. Admired? That sounds rather  professional. It sounds like the champagne talking. Why didn't you tell me? Cut! Dammit! That was a good one! Yeah, I think the lying on the bed  is not quite working, Chad. Let's  try one with the original blocking. Which one was that? There's been so  many damn changes. Could somebody  help me out please? The cue for the original blocking is  "professional." Thank you. Thank you very much. OK, right away. Call it, Wanda. Of course, Nicole; are you kidding?  Hold the roll, Wanda. Someone over here smells very, very  nice. Call it, Wanda. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take four! Nick, I just had a great idea! What is it, Chad? Just stop me if I'm out of line here,  but she says "admired from afar,"  right? Doesn't it make sense to see  Damian up close and her "afar?" You  start on a Close-up of Damian, watch  me here; as she declares her love,  the camera moves with me into this  primo two-shot that you and the  Wolfmeister have set up here. What do you think, Wolf? I don't like it. This is Ellen's  scene. I don't know; it sort of makes sense. Hey, you did it, man. It's all there  in the writing. I'd have to relight. Let's do it. Get me a tweenie right here, with  diffusion. I'll do it. Get the fucking light! Thanks. My pleasure. Sugar? Just a bit. You like jazz? Very much. Maybe we could go hear some tonight. Very well. What time do you think  we'll finish? Really? So am I. He's wonderful,  isn't he? He's so natural, like... air. I wonder what his sign is. Do you  know, Nicole? You don't have to be nasty. Yo, Wolfman. Is this my new mark? Until you change it. Where's my  fucking eyepatch?! Hey, Chad. Hey, whatya say. I'm Bob. I'm lighting this show. Chad Palomino; Actor. I know. Hey, what's your name? Maurice. Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any  relation? Probably not. Hey, smoking  crew guys, really. Hey thanks, Chad. Actually I wrote a  script. Oh, yeah? Hey, Bill. See that light over there? Uh, yeah. Lower it about three feet. Would you care to have a drink  tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you  say you and I have a drink tonight? That's OK, no problem. I'm just  slapping a little water on my face. So, it's going pretty good, huh? Yeah, you seem a little tense. But don't worry about it. Just take  your attention off yourself and put  it on Chad. Work off him a little  more. And listen, I know he's no Olivier.  But he's got something, don't you  think? Kind of a natural presence. So Nicole... anything else I can  help you with? Oh, sure. My eye is killing me. I lost it. That little light was set ten minutes  ago. Hey, you're not worried about the  time, I'm not worried about the time. I know you are. What do you think it means?! Oh yes you do, you know exactly what  it means. You don't understand me, Wanda! You  have no idea -- Hey, hey, hey! What the hell's going  on here?! Jesus, Wanda. This is a  very intimate scene and a lot of  tension on the set doesn't help. OK?  Now, Wolf, let's just go through the  first part of the move. Damian, on  your new mark. Good. Close-up, Damian;  Ellen in the background. Chad, what are you doing? Hey, that's my fucking eyepatch. Wolf, could I borrow it? Cause I'm  telling you, Nick; it really feels  right. I feel like this guy now,  man. I don't know, Chad. I don't think it  works. You're wrong, man. I'm going to fight  you on this one. Hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and I  don't want anyone wearing it. It's  insanitary. Fine. I'll get my own. Nick, send  someone out for an eyepatch. I'll  fucking pay for it myself. Listen, Chad. I didn't want to say  this in front of Wolf but it makes  you look a little... gay. Really? Yeah, a little bit. Jesus. You're right. Thanks, buddy. Good  call. One second. You need a rehearsal,  Wolf? Let's just fucking shoot it!! El Lobo! Call it, Wanda. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take four! And, action. Admired? That sounds rather  professional. It sounds like the champagne talking. Why didn't you tell me? Cut! Nick, could I talk to you a second? Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low  on that take. I'm out of here, man! What's the matter?! I like you, but I made a big mistake  taking this part. Have someone call  me a cab. Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to  me. What's going on!? I can't act with this woman. I know  she's a friend of yours but I got to  tell you: she cannot act worth a  shit! I'm giving her everything! The  whole thing I just did with the hair;  did you see that? I came up with  that on my own because I thought it  would help her. But no, she's giving  me nothing! I'm out of here. God, and all this time I thought... Why did you cast her? She sucked in  that Richard Gere movie! You're right. She is not the best  actress in the world. I see that now  but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm  asking you to please help me here.  We've got to get through this somehow. I'll tell you what this is about,  man. You know why she took a cab  this morning? Something came up. No. She was in my hotel room and she  didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm  sorry it had to come out like this  but I told her this morning "thanks  a lot, it was a lot of fun last night  but let's get something straight --  it was just a one-time deal," and  she didn't want to hear that. She  wanted more, you see what I'm saying?  It's rejection. Nicole, listen... What would you like to do? That's a fantastic idea. What do you  think, Chad? Hey, that's the only way I can work.  Let's take it apart, let's cut loose. Good! And we'll shoot it! Hell, why  not?! Roll that motherfucking camera,  Wolfie! Kiss my ass! Yeah! Let's go! Alright, now we're making a fucking  movie! Call it, Wanda! Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take five! And, action. Have you? That's, wow; that's  incredible. But that sounds kind of  professional doesn't it? Admired? Great! What's it mean? That sounds like the champagne  talking. No, you don't. You love me. Then I guess I have nothing else to  say. Well, I am surprised you feel this  way, Ellen. I always thought you  admired -- Hey, this isn't part of the scene. See, Nick! I told you this was about  rejection! You know, you are really starting to  piss me off! OK, guys, I think we can stop there. You bet your ass we can stop! Wanda,  call me a cab! Hold on, Chad. Let's just try to  calm down. Fuck you. I'm out of here, man. This  movie is bullshit. Now wait a second, Chad. There's no  reason for hostility. Shut up, you fucking loser. The only  reason I took this part was because  someone said you knew Quentin  Tarantino! You're nowhere, man. Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of  your shit, you hostess twinkie  motherfucker! What'd you call me? You heard me. Say it again. You hostess twinkie motherfucker! Alright, you've asked for it, Chad! You want to pick my brain?! This is  the way I direct hostess twinkie  scumbags like you! Get him out of here! Someone take  him back to his hotel! Chad... Are you alright? It's called "Tsunami." A Japanese  tidal wave hits New York. You've an  ex-Navy S.E.A L. frogman, working  undercover. You save the city. You'd  be perfect for the lead. That's my  number; call me, or I'll call you.  Either way it's been great working  with you, man. Nicole, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.  You were great in that Richard Gere  movie. I'm not lying. Christ, I tell everyone  how great you are. I've got nothing  but respect and admiration for you. Well, why do you think I wrote it?! It's about you. It's about how I  feel about you. Nicole. I've loved you since the day  we met. I didn't want anything to get in the  way of us working together. Why not? Next time. This is an emergency. ssss... kkkkkrrk. ssskk... ssssrrrk? Oh. Sorry. What do you want?! I need to use the bathroom. Kind of  an emergency. Well, fucking knock!! I swear to Christ, one of these days  I'm going to punch somebody in the  balls! Just as we pull up to your apartment  Palomino suddenly says he feels so  sick he can't work today. I don't know. Don't know that either. But I'm not  worrying about it. I had this dream  last night where I was on the set.  You were in it, and another woman,  someone older. Anyway, everything  was going wrong. The harder I tried  to hold things together the more  they fell apart. And you know what  that dream was telling me, Nicole?  You just got to roll with it. And  that's what I'm doing, I'm rolling  with it. So, we'll just shoot the  Dream Sequence today. Hey, Tito. You look great, man. I feel like shit. No, you look good. Thanks for coming  in on such short notice. This is  Nicole; she's playing Ellen. Tito. Listen, if there's anything I can do  to make you... if you need... uh,  just let me know. Put a stool in the bathroom. Did I just offend him? "Short notice?" Oh yeah? Was I freaking out? That's great: I freak out in my dream;  I freak out in your dream. No wonder  I'm fucking exhausted. Yeah? Alright, guys; special effects today.  Could be fun. Who knows how to work  this baby? It's the old T-160. I used it once  in '85. Damn. '85. What's this? That's where the gas goes. No, that's where the oil goes. Is it? I think so. You're right. It's coming back now. I'm going to let you handle this  one, Bob. This is your baby. And  Les, if he needs help you give him a  hand. OK, guys? We're all working  together today. Yup, all coming back now. Like riding  a bike. T-160, 1985. 1985, T-160. Way to go, Bob. How are we doing, Wanda? Scene thirty-one?! I left my notes  for Scene thirty-one at home! I didn't  know we were -- Oh, OK. Send somebody to my apartment  to pick them up; it's the red  notebook, under the bed. Good. Great. Good. We're all lit, the smoke machine is  under control; we're ready to go. Just need to see a run-through and  we're all set. I'm going to make  your job easy today, Wanda. Wandaful. Mmm, I'm glad you wore that perfume.  And don't worry about Palomino; I'll  take you to a jazz club tonight. Oh, by the way my eye's much better. What do you mean? So do I. Sure. Thanks. OK, here's the shot. We start wide  with Ellen standing absolutely still  right in the middle of the frame.  You got that, Wolf? Yeah. What happened to your eye? Nothing. It's a little sensitive  today. Can you see? Of course I can see! OK, Ellen is standing there. The  smoke is flowing in and: Ellen's  line. Good, Tito, that's your cue. You walk around her once, hold the  apple out, that's right; just beyond  her reach. You're staring at her  hard. Harder, good. Then stop right  here. Can we get a mark, please? Then we dolly in to Tito's Close-up.  Alright, Wolf? No, I think it's better on the dolly. Whatever. No, just the apple. And Tito, right  after we dolly in give me a little  laugh there. A little laugh? Big, little; anything you feel like  doing. OK? Good. Let's shoot one.  Call it, Wanda. Hold it, Wanda. Can we get a little  more smoke? Is that possible? Oh, sure. Good. Call it, Wanda. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take one! And, action. And... cut. Yeah, just a couple. I thought that  was uh... good. Tito, that was very  good, man, really. You didn't feel  like laughing? I laughed. Oh, OK; I guess I missed it. You  could make it bigger if you want.  And Ellen, maybe just a little more  tension when you see him. Right, maybe you see him a little  bit. You see him. It's Tito. Toto. Ellen, come on now; concentrate.  Remember; you're marrying Damian  tomorrow. You're a little anxious.  You have this dream. Let's call it  an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents  the anxiety. OK? It seems pretty simple. Good. And Bob, let's really have  some smoke on this one. OK, more smoke. I still think it should be hand-held. Yeah, well, I don't want it hand- held. I want it on the dolly. Where's  my notebook, Wanda? Good. Call it, Wanda. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take two! And, action. Cut. Yes. OK, Ellen, good. You're on to  something there. Well, it's not fake; it's real. Just  remember, you really want the apple.  Tito, I still think we could see  more of a laugh at the end. What kind of laugh? Just a laugh. Show me. Oh, OK. A laugh. I'm thinking maybe  like this. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Something like that. OK? And remember,  Tito, this is a dream. Not everything  has to make sense. A laugh right  there heightens our sense of... of... Anxiety. Exactly. Wolf, how was that for you? I still think it should be hand-held. Well, God damn it! It's not going to  be! It's on the dolly so just forget  about it! And Bob, what the fuck is that smoke?  Might as well get a couple hamsters  in here blowing smoke rings for  Christ's sake. The septic valve wasn't open. I got  it now. We're going to see some smoke  now. Alright, let's try another take. Nick, could I talk to you for a  minute? What?! In private. Alright. We'll see some smoke now. Way to go, Bob. I really don't like being spoken to  like that, Nick! Yeah, well I don't like your attitude! I don't have an attitude! The hell you don't! Every time I ask  you to do something all I get is No,  No, No and I'm sick of it! I hired  you to do a job; if you're not going  to do it you better let me know right  now! I'm sorry, Nick. I'm going through  some heavy shit. What do you mean? I can't really go into it. It's pretty  heavy. Personal? Personal, professional, emotional.  It's doing a number on me. And now  you're telling me you're going to  fire me. I didn't say that, Wolf. Come on,  I'm not going to fire you. You're  doing a great job here. Am I? Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without  you, man. You've got a great eye. I  just hope it's not the one under  that eyepatch. Listen, Wolf. Let me tell you one  thing I've learned; sometimes you  just have to roll with things. You  know? You're right. Roll with it, man. You'll be OK. Thanks, bro. That's where the oil goes. No, that's where the gas goes. I'm tellin' you, Bob. That's where  the oil goes. Lester, don't you think Bob knows  where the oil goes?! I don't remember using oil in '85. Maybe both the oil and gas go in  there? I think he's right. I think he is too. OK, three parts  gas, one part oil. Is my notebook here yet, Wanda? Good. Call it, Wanda. Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take three! And, action. Cut! Cut! Cut! I can't find the switch! Pull the plug! Bob! Pull the plug! I got it! I got it! I'm off the set! Mom! She was waiting outside Nick's  apartment when I went to pick up his  notebook. She said she was looking  for him so I figured I should just  bring her up here. You look really  pretty in that dress. How did you get here? How did you get out of your room? It was unlocked!? Mom, you've got to stop doing this.  I'm serious. I'm a little upset with  you. You could have gotten lost, or  hurt. I know, Mom; I've missed you too.  But it's not really a good time. Jesus, I don't believe this. There. How's that, Mom? Can you see? Shhhh! No. Now come on, Mom. You've  got to be quiet. Absolutely quiet. Good; real good. How's the smoke machine? Forget it. We'll shoot without it. That's the way it goes, Wanda. We're  just going to have to roll with it.  Nothing else we can do. We've got to  roll with it, right, Wolf? OK, here we go. Ellen, you've got to  keep reaching for that apple. I don't  feel that you really want it. I mean,  Christ, how many times do I have to  tell you! Alright, Nicole. What's the matter? Now wait just a second! I'm sorry if I was short with you,  Nicole, but I think you can see I'm  under a little pressure here. I'm  shooting a Dream Sequence without a  smoke machine, my mother's out there  thinking she's at a circus wedding  and you tell me the whole movie seems  fake! You did too. You said, "Everything  feels fake." Nicole, that's ridiculous. You're a  fantastic actress. All you have to  do is show me you want that apple  more than anything else in the world;  don't give up. Understand? You cannot  give up. Ready! OK, here we go. Everybody focus,  concentrate. And Tito, we're still  looking for that little laugh, pal.  OK? Call it, Wanda! Speed! Rolling! Scene six, take four! And, action. Cut! Mom, listen to me. I don't want you  to move from this chair. Do you  understand? Mom, I'm serious. Thank you. OK, good. Very good. Tito, I think we're having a little  communication problem here. All I  want you to do is laugh. OK? Why? I told you why. Tell me again. Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal.  It's a dream, alright. Strange things  happen in a dream. All you have to  do is laugh. Why is that such a  problem? Why does it have to be a dwarf? What? Why does my character have to be a  dwarf? He doesn't have to be a dwarf. Then why is he?! Is that the only  way you can make this a dream; put a  dwarf in it? No, Tito; that's not -- Have you ever had a dream with a  dwarf in it?! Do you know anyone  who's had a dream with a dwarf in  it? NO! I don't even have dreams  with dwarves in them! The only place  I've seen dwarves in dreams is in  stupid movies like this! Make it  weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone  will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a  dream, there's a fucking dwarf in  it!" Well, I'm sick of it. You can  take this Dream Sequence and shove  it up your ass! No. He's absolutely right. You want to just shoot Ellen, Nick?  She could be in the dream by herself. No. We're not going to shoot anything.  I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help,  but it's over. I can't take it  anymore. I tried to roll with it but  it's time to face the music; I can't  do this. I am not a director. The  shoot is over. I give up. Take the camera off the dolly. Start  putting it away. Roll camera. Roll sound. Let's go.  Right away. And cut!! Wolf, talk to me, man! Did you get  it? Got it, Nick! Everything! The Close-up? Perfect. See? That's what I meant  about going hand-held! You're a genius, man! What about the  focus?! Nailed it. Fuckin' A! How was the sound? I could use another but definitely  acceptable. Mom, you kook! That was incredible!  Did you know we were filming? You were great, you're a natural.  And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't  you dare tell me that felt fake. Oh, hold on. Let me think a second. Can I use it for the Dream Sequence,  that's the question. Does it work  for the Dream Sequence? We're going with it, Wanda! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! I need to record room tone. I'll  need thirty seconds of silence. It's for the sound, Mom. We just  have to be quiet. Speed. We have a new category this year:  Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being.  And the winner is none other than my  Best Bud, Nick Reve! Had any experience? Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger? Oh God, Wanda! I love your power.  It's like an afferdesiac to me! In closing I'd like to say to all  the people who told me not to make  this movie, who wouldn't meet with  me or return a simple phone call. To  my favorite professor at Film School  whose parting advice to me was to  take a job teaching at a women's  college. To Delores DelSporto, the  girl I loved in high school who left  me for a Jr. Varsity football player:  to all these people I'd like to say  thank you but I can't because what I  really feel like saying is go fu -- And, that's a cut on room tone.
