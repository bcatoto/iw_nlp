Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour. Thirty-five bucks. You haven't paid the cab. He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him. Mister D'Amour?Hey, anytime. Actually, no. This was enough. I'm out of here, man! Are you coming? Knew what? Trickery and divinity. Yeah, he says that all the time. I mean, there's no instructions-- What do you mean, they're not tricks? Take a look at this. doorway) And who's that? I could have lost my fucking hands. Nope. I love weird. Why? You ever been married? I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe. It'll be something hokey. I'm sure they'll have this place rigged. I think maybe he taught Swann. This is me. See ya around. Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix. Nix. I've heard a name. Someone they talk about in whispers. I gotta be careful. If Vinovich sees me talking to you. He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.For now. Are you planning to go back to New York? Another fucking magician. Jesus. And this Butterfield guy-- After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones. Where the fuck is he? New one on me. Okay. Let's see him. What makes you so sure? Tapert. So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield. What were you doing up there?You bet. Hello, L.A. Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled. How much? Yeah? Yeah. It's French. Thanks, Billy. Hokey enough for you? That's because he knew. He'd seen these files and knew. What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between -- Maybe they're not tricks. A Nix specialty? That's Butterfield... That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle. Which was presumably the idea. These are about Nix. Billy? This was on Miller's forehead. Any idea what it is? My life was too weird for her. Yeah. She was killed in a car crash. Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce. You heard right. How? Who is he? Nix? Who? They go together. Right. Right. D.A.M.O.U.R. D'Amour. Harry D'Amour. All right. It was... I told you -- Deep shit? Beats me. You did. Didn't you? Out! Out! What the fuck? I think so. I'm okay. I'm okay. I... have... to. ...yes? ... oh... God... No! No! No! Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot. I've got to help him. Hang on! It's all right. It's not hurting... Find Valentin! Find him! Get him in here! It's okay. Quaid and Jennifer-- And they all came... I'm sure. He's dead. Don't be. Nix can't hurt you now. Nothing you don't want. Nothing's going to happen to you. I'm here, aren't I? It's okay. He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he? What then? You said you weren't with him for love. Too much fame. Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours. So Swann was performing magic. not illusions? And what? You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions. He taught all this to Swann? Stuff? He was the real thing, right? Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal? Why don't you tell me the truth? Jennifer Desiderio, for one. She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon. I didn't leave. I was just digging around. Okay. I'll keep digging. What about Jennifer Desiderio? Just curious. Back to business. Ever heard of a man called Nix? Dorothea? So why did you marry him? You didn't marry him for love. Why? Because he had you? I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right. He didn't have a lot of fans up there. Forget the fee. If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money. If I don't... ...my gamble. Either way... I get to spend some time... here. I can be very persuasive. Well... how about some of the other illusionists? I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look... Are they treating you okay? He's good. Sure. Do you? When do you want me to start? I'm no bodyguard. Harry. Where do I sign? Sorry. You asked. He's an illusionist. It's not exactly brain surgery. But obviously you still care what happens to him. Does that mean...? And you don't ask questions? Why not? What's the connection? You don't? Did your husband know Quaid? No. Not yet... Are you finished with me? --vanished. He got up and walked. I got a file on him two inches thick. He's a petty fraudster. This is something else. Ever heard of someone called the Puritan? Tapert's got nothing to do with this. He came here to get his palm read. I'm a private detective. I was hired to follow somebody for a few days. A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud. Great accent, by the way. Is it Brooklyn? With what? Just tell me about Swann. Or are you too scared? I'd like to hear them. You tell me. No? I thought you'd maybe have a theory. I heard he was the best. What about Swann's miracles? So could you walk on water? Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real? Heaven and Hell? You believe that? What about? Shut up. We've lost enough lives already. We've got to get you to a hospital. Shit... I want to see Swann face to face. Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake. Was that Swann's idea? And then... because I was getting too close to something -- --or someone, you called Swann You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes? You rigged the illusion to fail, right? No. Shut up! Yeah, I know. When will she be in? I want to speak to Dorothea. No. I like to know why things happen. Fuck regrettable! I want to know why. Left alone? Somebody's been murdered. You didn't hire me. She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her. What for? Why'd you come here? What the fuck are you doing here? Who is she? Are you sure? It's not a bad place. Warm. Great view. Any movie stars buried here? What's the difference? When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician. I saw him in Vegas once. Philip Swann? Havanas. You're not the smoker. So who is? Somebody's been smoking in here for months. Nah. You're driving it too carefully. Whose is the car? I'm going back to New York in-- Shit! I'm outta here. Then what do you want? Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay? I get a few drinks inside me -- What are you, my mother? Go away. Shit. And what does Jennifer think's real? Does anybody? What's her problem? I won't say anything. A Mister Quaid? Who is he? The Puritan? Hold on. Not much. Yeah. You could say that. What? You need an ambulance. Have you been in? Are they all in the business? I only wear ties for funerals. Well... nobody. For what? I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys. Sure. Vivovich. Not the Walter Wilder? Was he taking a lot of risks? I'm in from New York. I came to see Swann. Harry D'Amour. That. Where'd you learn that? Try. Can you do it? He did something with the ground. You didn't try hard enough. Fuck. Jesus... what the hell's going on in there? In my time, and nobody else's. Nobody's better off this wav! ... no... They got here before us. Jesus! Who else did? Did Valentin? Did she know where Nix was buried? And you believed him? Is that all? And he didn't have them? And you're not? Is that all? Didn't know you read minds. Oh Jeez. Help me. And she shot him I I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix. So Nix won't come looking for her? Oh yeah? Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now. That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it? Or murdered, like Nix. You know, it's such a fucking waste. You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick. I don't think so. You need me alive. How the fuck do you do that? Look, Ma, no wires. A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive. What? A couple of weeks. There's other guys as good as me, Loomis. I got to go. I'm late. No. I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation. And he's dead? Is he the Puritan? Who's not? Swann? What is? Why's that? What about Philip Swann? Well, you didn't forget me. I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield. No.Who is she? One question. Yeah. But not as cheap. Call me. Call me tomorrow. You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on? The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession. Get your ass back to Mew York.What about death? About? What do you mean, "all of us?" He won't. No. He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit. Like you. I saw him on T.V. Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life. I know him. I saw him.Liar! Wait... you still feel something for that bitch? But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was. You know I'll kill you when we're done. I have to. The woman has a new love in her life. Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me Because you've got nothing else to live for. You could still help me do that. I should have been honest with you, right from the start. I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways. I was born to murder the world. Swann? What are you doing? You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit? You don't think I've got it to give? I've got so much power to give you, Swann. All you have to do is...beg.Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm. Yes. Yes. Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there. Ask Pimm. Yes... I'm not afraid to die. There's something terrible... coming home... You can't change it. You have to walk... ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell. It's your destiny. Accept it. You're drawn to the dark side, over and over. And it's drawn to you. You don't like that. You've taken some strange journeys in your life. My God. Too late. Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?No. I'm not going near him. I'm putting in a new illusion tonight. Will you be there? I just saw him. Somebody killed him. Yeah. Remember Quaid? The usual. Full house. Standing ovation. I tell them it's magic... I don't know. Yes? I can't... I can't go any further... This is where we killed him. At a guess... they just resurrected him. That's where we're all going. You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour. He's better off this way. Looks that way. Yes. No. I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick. No illusions. Just the truth. Are you ready for that? No. At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone. Jelly. Shit... He had something. He showed me how to bend the rules. A little levitation. A few fireworks. Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe. That's why I liked Nix. He promised me all these explanations. I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service. It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die. I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that. So I like playing games with people. Gives them something to wonder about... You think I'm an asshole. Will that do? No? I don't know what else to do. It's me betrayed him. Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her. I did it for Dorothea. He deserved it. Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour. Magicians get burned. Why? So you can fuck my wife? Now I'm going to have to kill you. You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour. They'll never find out. No! Yes. Yes. Not true. Why would I want to? And? Binding you. Don't touch me. He's got... got into my head. No! Fuck you.Oh yes. We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together. She has no real grip on reality. Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever. Right. And he's dead, isn't he? I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know. And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told. Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.Oh Christ! Oh Christ! I swear... this is the place Swann told me about. The rocks... Not yet. I'll tell you. I don't know. Don't. Please. Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann. I left three messages already. It's better he's gone. He would have done more harm than good. Crank call. I'll get the number changed. Good. There. Yes? ... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more. I'm sorry, D'Amour... Don't bother. Him too. Help me. D'Amour -- Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over? Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter? No. It was mine. I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after. I tried to pay you off. Yes. Yes. Are you satisfied now? Leave her alone -- You want more money, is that it? I can't let you in. I'm afraid she's not in. Why people die? Give it up, D'Amour. Go home. What for? You need to stay busy? Yes. It's regrettable She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain. Enough churning over the past. She wants it all left alone. A ticket home, You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief. Here's thirty thousand dollars. Looking for you. I tried the hotel. Swann's wife. Are you a believer, then? I don't think the dead much care. Probably. Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real. Never call him that. He's strictly an illusionist. Are you a gambling man? You know of him? You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. I work for the best illusionist in the world. Maybe I just bought it. Mine. Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day? I'm here to offer you a job. We've never met. I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour. About last night. It's one in the afternoon. Mr. D'Amour?No. There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course. He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer. That's what they call the Repository. Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room. It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation. You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists. Except most of us aren't gentlemen. For an introduction. People are pretty cagey. Who do you know? He knew Swann way back. He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit. You know Vinovich? You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way. What a tragedy. It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business. I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you. At birth. I don't know you -- What?
