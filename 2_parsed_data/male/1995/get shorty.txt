You're right. We'll get it later. And that's for the airport. Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president? Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down? You get life for kidnapping. Trade for what? No. What's this? And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then? What about him? After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other. Farrah. Come here. Come here, Farrah... That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy. Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done. Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding. I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa. His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie... You see the paper? I mean I don't care. I guess still in the locker. He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it. They all sound big at the talking stage. Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo. Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard. You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some. About sixty. I think I pulled my quadriceps. Not too bad. I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace. Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off. I have to ask you for that key. You spotted them, huh? So you didn't have the key with you.You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him. Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something. Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons. Calm down, Bear... The money. Fuck. I gotta think... Plan B. Here ya go, honey... You get the money? Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight. I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere. Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline? I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day. He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat. Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew. Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings? Who? Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room. Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him. I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot. You guess? You mean you don't know? So where's the money? Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big. And I mean high up in it. That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer. Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies. You see that? The way the man just went right over? Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him. You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar. He's around someplace. Maybe your nephew panicked, took off. Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal. I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it. Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way. Sure. Family. I know how that goes. Your who? Man, I can't wait for you to be dead. Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado. You broke in my house and I have a witness to it. She's great. Gimme the money. In the can. That the money? I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel. You know Laurel Canyon? Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping. That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies. She can't talk right now. Three. In just a second. Two... How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One... Tell you what... The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo. I need the money. I really think I can be of service on this one. That's all. There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done. Who? Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script? With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is? What about her? I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle. So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole. So whatta you think of the script? I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan? I wonder, would that work? You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep. No shit, come on. How you gonna do that? Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy. You must bring something heavy to the deal. Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace. I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has. You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him. You can talk to me. What's this movie you're doing first? That's the magic number. It's not the kind of thing you do. It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about. Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up. He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer. So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him? We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer. How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double. All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up. Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest. Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that. Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it. Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy. You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this? You positive about that? Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy". What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now. You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account. Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one. What I been wondering is where's he been.You say look at you? What? Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money? Or else what? So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here? Never heard of him. Who? Okay. So who are you? Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real. What three hundred grand? Depends. Who's this? Who is this? Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -� I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -� forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right? You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go. Why haven't you left? Yeah? Which terminal? 'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me. Don't insult me. Get up and turn around. I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me. You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that. Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city. I don't like waiting. He owes me money. Ray Barboni. From Miami.You're kidding me, right? I reserved a Cadillac. What is this? No shit? What're some of 'em? So... how many movies you been in? How 'bout when you went down the stairs? What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay? Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car. You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead. What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back? What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in? You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that? I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right? Bear, you're not really gonna �- It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne. What? First you and me gotta get a couple things straight. Where's Karen? Gimme an hour. I'll find it. Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it. Karen? You okay? I don't believe this. What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo? I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is. Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you? What money? Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know. That's all there is to it, huh? You know how to write one of these? She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good. Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores. She's... young. Get something going there. There's Ilona. Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy". Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy. Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers". I put a gun right here... ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that. Yeah, we're getting Martin. That's right, me. It's what he said, I'm his associate. I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit. That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you. That's what I thought. So let me put it this way... But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him? Harry, let me answer that. Whatever you want, Ray. I like it here. Sovereign. I checked the bag at the airport, when I came. Why would I do that? So what brings you to L.A., Bones? How'd you get in here? That's what I'd do. Make sure I got the right guy next time. Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it. It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something? I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here. Not yet. I just started. I'm a producer. I'm in the movie business. That's right. Movie producer? Yeah, why not. What've you got? Leo spanked a waitress? Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key. Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money... Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died. Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble. Forget about Leo's money, Harry. I found him. Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting. Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up. Is he giving you a check or cash? Here's your keys, Harry. Hey, Harry. That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink. You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears. Never say anything unless you have to. I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut. You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.' That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am. No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down. Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action... What's he doing? Following a guy? Let's see how we get along. Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do. But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it. I'm not gonna pop her, Harry. So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie. He drown? So what's the problem? She looks familiar. No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney. Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone". Who's the star? "Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title? What's it called? For a movie? You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with? You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not? Harry, look at me. I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean. Once. Maybe a few times I have. Not really. They always paid. What I did till recently. After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next. I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen. I'm not the guy, Harry. You mean, Leo? Part of it, yeah. The shylock's the good guy. I said I had an idea, that's all. I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens. Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list... That's right. As a matter of fact... Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money. You just did. Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing? You make movies, huh? Come on, Harry -� Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position. I want you to. You're not looking at me, Harry. They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore... A marker's like a check, Harry. Harry, lemme give you some advice. We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is. You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino? I want you to keep looking right here, okay? You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to. We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer. Where you been, Harry? Twenty seven hundred. Ask your man here. 'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.' Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway. It was in the Herald. Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month. Yeah, he told me. He died. Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya. That's not bad. I think you got it down. Compass. Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans. Buddy? At that point, basically, that has to be it. It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation. Good-looking, too. Like Karen. Yeah, but you haven't found him yet. The guy took off for Las Vegas. I believe it. That's not bad. Now you're squinting like you need glasses. What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed? No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it. Martin, look at me. Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure. Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami. One we're producing. I'm thinking of a movie. So you want to know. So you don't know what I'm thinking. You mean like we don't give a shit. We talk different? Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act. You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone. I'll find you, Leo... At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving. Sit down, Leo. You can keep what you won today. That's yours. I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass. Here's another tip... Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here. From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty? You've been losing. You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want. You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank? I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are. I know who he works for. Where's your phone. Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me? You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine. Couldn't find my toothbrush. I'll be right back. I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared? You bet. Karen! What the fuck are you doing?! You okay? I'll go. I'll go. I don't know. It's not Dave. It's a movie. You sure? Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies. Why not? What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway? What happened? I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -� You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor? Oh. You thought I was faking? Yeah. There's a girl in it now. That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right. Although I've added to it. How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life. Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty. I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together. How'd you meet Martin anyway? Depends, who pays? The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back. Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot. This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset... Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time. I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny. Why does anyone want to be in movies? That why you came over here, to ask me that? Sounds fair. There a part in it for you? Not yet. I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name. What do you think? I got you a copy of the script. You been here the whole time? Yeah. Right. Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican? Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner. Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you. Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped. That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie? You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read. How come you stopped making movies with Harry? "Cotton". Man, can you scream. For any movie. Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -� which by the way was a better book than a movie -� did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look. Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top. Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real. Rough day on the set? No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here. I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night. Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'? A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years. A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad. That's right. Three percent. Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay. No, it was open. It wasn't locked. The door from the patio, in back. I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer. I'm thinking about producing. I'm going into the movie business. Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now. How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him? You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing. You said don't say nothing and I didn't. Don't say a fuckin' word. That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep? Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that. That's what the guy said. Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films. What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it. They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?Get him out've here. That's the idea. I'll think about it. Something shouldn't be there. By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used? Your wife a Lakers fan? You have a card in here? You're an investor, is that it? What're you doing in Los Angeles? You live in Miami?Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer. Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway. Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now. Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.That's great, Harry. So what's the -- Hm? Yeah? What three words, Harry? What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick. Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.I went to UC San Diego. We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money. I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars. Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think? Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here? A zillion, huh? That's a lot. Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker? You gave him the money? He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money. He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand? Yayo. Where is he? Where is my nephew?C-18. I don't know. The airport. Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred? Leo, I don't know. You're gonna just give me five hundred grand? You serious? Chili Palmer showed you my script? Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it? I'm working on a few things. Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people �- It's a different kind of deal. I can't do it. That's correct. Look at me. Look at me, Ray. Ray. Look at me. Or else use your fucking imagination. Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else. Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm. Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player. I work for Harry Zimm, alright? Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real. Hello? You there? The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession. Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you? Are you the guy they called Ray Bones? Ray Barboni? Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie. Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names... Who? You have it? So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him. A meeting with who? You and Karen? Really. I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies. Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport. Get the fuck outta my chair. Yeah, Chili. Hi. You're fifty feet in the air! How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there? His shrink's trainer. I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing. I had to tell 'em something. What? You're kidding, right? They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are. Read it. It's a grabber. What do you get out of this? You don't even know these guys. Just a thought. That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -� Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script. Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along. The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back. Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it. She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades. "Ride the Clouds". Good picture. One of his best parts. Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir. Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it. It's not bad when you know what it's about. "Mr. Lovejoy". A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy". Because I need half a million to buy a script. Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs. These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -� this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer �- Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it? Really? You ever been arrested? Ever shot anybody. What does that mean? You pack a gun? I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying. Is that right, that's what you do for a living? So you don't work for the casino? But you work for the casino? You wouldn't be talking to me if you were. Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner? The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast. That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy. That's it? That's your movie? So he comes to L.A... Keep going. Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone. It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken. I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops. You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her. Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores. I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen. Fuckin' basketball game. You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken? Why do I have to keep looking at you? I know what a marker is. Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information? Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this? That's what I'm doing. I'm looking at you. Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack? Have we met? I don't recall. Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do. What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them. So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.' 'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.' You heard me, Pick 'n' Save. Pick 'n' Save. She's scared! Fear is an emotion! Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking. All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene. Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now... She's gonna talk to Martin? Yeah, but whose point of view? How honorable of you. Yeah, what'd he have to say? So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy? I mean morally. Murray was my friend. I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris. Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was. Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there. What do you want, Doris? Come on in. Hello, Doris. Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick. 'We?' He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want. Oh, yeah, sure. No problem. You go on off to bed. Yeah, that's what we need. More agents. That's where you got the idea? He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far. Sit down, have a drink. Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks. I'm going. Anyone skim the pool? It needs it. You don't? What happened to Muff? Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on. I don't hear anything. What's wrong? Shylock? What money? Mob guy? Which two?But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be. You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it? It's all mine. How? By taking my money? It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake? How'd you know I was here? Who told you that? I'm up twelve grand today. They report it to the IRS. I didn't know where else to keep it. Where would you?Mr. Barboni is a good customer. Works for Jimmy Capp. We call you a taxi. Maybe you don't see my sign? It's not one of these?Whatta you think, Chill? Wow. Mind if I take it for a spin? What's that? Very nice... Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting. You're not going to tell me the rest? Okay. I'm listening. So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look? The wife sues the airline. This is a gutsy babe. How do I know that? I turn it on when I confront the guy. That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing. How about this? Wait. How about this? Like this? I'm looking at you. Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do? What happened? The pressure got to you? With what? Wiseguy money? One of mine? If you'd like to tell me, yeah. No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious. Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads. It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views. A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech. Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play. Yeah. That was a good party. The three hundred large. What other money is there? I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock. I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they? Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love. I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with. Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too. I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey �- This your ride, Chili? Yeah, Karen knows him. I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to. Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away? I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories. Of us. Karen. Wow. Look at you...Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it. You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh... Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'. Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect. Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife. What Get Away jet? Personally? How'd you know he died, he tell you? You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over. You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie. By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco. Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately. I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man? Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time. Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me. Get in line, bro. The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner. What, like that's supposed to mean something to me? Who the fuck are you?Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit. How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies. What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star? Whatta you doing out there? He already knew it. All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't. No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead. I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time. I told you not to -� In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down. No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe. Hey, Chili. Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that. Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat. You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat? What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job. Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
