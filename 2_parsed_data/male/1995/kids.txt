Now you gotta be careful. You're clean. Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections. Were they wearing condoms? With how many people? Have you ever had anal intercourse? How many times have you gone unprotected? Yes. Altogether. How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with? How old you?Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'. That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural. Nah. Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles. Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude. Yo, you got any weed around here? Yeah probably. About ten. Fifteen is good. How much you gonna take? Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties. Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big. Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs. So really, it's good luck. I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did. I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off. So. You never know when you can end up like that. So. What are you talking about? Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs. He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage. Why I give pennies? Why I do what? You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted? Bet. How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law. She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them. I know what you mean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's only 13. Darcy? Oh. You like her? Who? Man, this guy is really good. I hate this game. Yeah me too nigga. Yep. That girl you boned last year. Remember? Can you do it man? No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"! And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl. And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right? Well, those guys share everything, right? Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know. Activate in the form of, a glass of water. You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything. Unzip my pack, yo. Three pennies and a ball of lint. Yeah, I feel dehydrated. They're gonna tell their grand kids. That Telly. He sure was good in the sack! Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is. It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first. It's no big deal, right? It is right. Why? Did she suck your dick? Telly. Den less go Joe. He lives on 76th? You think? You think he's got any herb? What for? That guys a dick. Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec. Get another forty. Smoke a blunt. Shit. Did you tell her that you loved her? She's probably smash you in the fucking face. You mean like fucking two virgins at once. What do you mean? To what? Virgins? Yeah. Yeah. Right. How? What? Let me smell it again. Oh man, that's the best. Oh man, it smells like butterscotch. How did she smell? Did her puss stink? Yeah. How long did you fuck her? Oh shit. How long did it take? She can fuck? Well, how was it? I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up! You fucked it? Shit. Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe. What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches. Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here? I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice. No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care. Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka. I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken. Na. Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight. Yeah. Maybe Nasa. I don't know. Right here. Nothen' B. I'm gonna fuck you up bitch. Sup. Sup. Sup then? Sup? Nuffin' G. Just forget it. Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.Here. Swallow. Come on Jennie.

Feelin' the effex. Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle. Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?Yeah. Do it again. Yeah me too. Man we fucked him up. Yo, we might have killed him.

I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now. I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit. Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid. Yeah? What?! Holy shit. That's all true? Oh god. That's horrible. No. Yeah? I hate 'em. Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade. How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too. Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me? Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this? Hello. That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes. Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub. I don't know, eight or nine. You want a wip-it? What are you guys doing? Hello? Hello?Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK? I can't man. What man? What is it?Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell. Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier. Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy. I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes. Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth. Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her. Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl. Am I getting warm? Are you in trouble with the law? Did you and your boyfriend just break up? No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right? Miss, would I be prying? Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does. A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul. Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all... You're OK? Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe. Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.Hold up man. Why not? You stink. You are? Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park. You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight? Fifteen for me. I don't know. How much do you want? Shut the fuck up. Yeah. Good luck? Shut up. Right. So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks. Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by. That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do. Yeah. Why you give money. That. I don't understand why you do that. I guess so. I gotta stop off home too. I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me. I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her. At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin. I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection. And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on. I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt. She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her. It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember? Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent. Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now. Darcy. Benny's little sister. I wanna fuck Darcy. He looks like my uncle. No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends. I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know. But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic. Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to? Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire. Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring. Right. Right. Yeah. The cartoon? You down with the boost? You got any money? You thirsty? Yep. Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it. I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost. I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy. A little bit. But I didn't really want her to. Yeah. 78th. Probably. I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out. I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer. You wanna go to Paul's house? Are you hungry? What do you want? Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys. I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect. That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen. I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit. Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies. I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit. And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl. And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby. And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup. And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little. Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right. I can tell that she had just entered puberty. You know what else? You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom. Hell's yeah. She was so clean. But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good. Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time. Did what take? Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow. Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck. Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon. What do you think? Was up bitch? Of course I do. I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle. Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me. I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about. I just know. I know you'll love it. I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it. Trust me. Don't be nervous. No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all. I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head. I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed. Do you like kissing me? Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring. Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise. Come on. You can rave on another night. Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out. You should come back with me to Steven's house. Yeah. I can understand that. She won't? Why not? Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you? Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up. I was lookin' for you all day today. Yeah. Yeah. After I saw you last week. You know I've been thinking about you lately. Is it cold? Yeah. Come on. Come on. Come swimmin' with us. Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us! Hey. What are you doin' right now? Of course I do. You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise. What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change. I want to make you happy. That's all. I don't know. I just think that you would love it. Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it. You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff. Because your a virgin? Why? What do I want to do? You know what I want to do? I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg? Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg. Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it? Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg? I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office. No. I was just kidding. Yep. So that's why Casper is how he is. You've heard the stories right? It's not his fault. He had a hard life. He still does. You think so? All right. Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks. Not too late. Not too late. I'm gonna go out for a little while. Mom. But then I won't need your money. Hi mom. Yep. Where does everyone sleep? So, how many people live here now? Nah. Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to. Paul it's Telly. Open up. It's me. Telly. OK. Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid. Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please. Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.I'm sorry. The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should... Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection. Have you ever had anal intercourse? Were you protected?
