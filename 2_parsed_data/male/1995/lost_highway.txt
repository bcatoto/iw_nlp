Dick Laurent is dead. What are you going to do? Read?... Read what, Renee? It's nice to know I can still make you laugh. That's why I married you. What's that? Who's it from? Does it say anything on the tape? Well, let's see what's on it. Come on. Maybe. Good book, huh? Same one you were reading the other night? When you didn't come to the club. I called, you know. From the club.  You didn't answer. You were asleep when I got home, yes. I had a dream about you last night... You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you. Then there you were... lying in bed...  but it wasn't you... It looked like  you... but it wasn't. You're up early. Who the hell owns that dog? What's that?  Another tape? Don't you want to watch it? Well, do you wanna watch it? All right. So? That's it. Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom. Very strange. The angle.  The high angle shot on the tape. How'd the camera get so high like that? And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean. Like you'd get if it was hand held. Right ... This just glided along. This is the bedroom. Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you? This is our bedroom. There's no other bedroom? No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed. You're a musician? Yes, I thought my wife ... What's your axe? Tenor... Tenor saxophone.  Do you... Tone deaf. Do you own a video camera? I like to remember things my own way. What do you mean by that? How I remember them.  Not necessarily the way they happened. Do you have an alarm system? Why not? It kept going off for some reason.  False alarms. Might be a good time to try using it again. Anybody else have a key to the house. Maid?  Relative? Let's check the doors and windows... See if there's been a break-in. We'll keep a watch on the house. As best we can. If anything else happens, you'll call us. Al hands Fred a card.  Ed hands Renee a card. Thanks, guys. It's what we do. I wish I knew. What? You don't remember being awakened?  It looks like you were aware of someone. Or something. No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember. Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently? Or not so recently? No, not to me. We'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you? We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled. Where would you feel safe? Did you use the alarm system since we were here last? The first night ... Not the last two. Why not? I forgot.  Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid. I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on. We'll find out, Mrs. Madison. We've met before, haven't we? I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met? At your house.  Don't you remember? No, no I don't.  Are you sure? Of course.  In fact, I'm there right now. What do you mean?  You're where right now? At your house. That's absurd. Call me. Dial your number. Go ahead. I told you I was here. How did you do that? How did you get into my house? You invited me.  It's not my habit to go where I'm not wanted. Who are you? Give me my phone back. It's been a pleasure talking to you. Just a minute. Andy, who is that guy? I don't know his name.  He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think. Dick Laurent? Yes, I believe so. But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he? He is?  I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead? I don't.  I don't know him. Dick can't be dead.  Who told you he was dead? Let's go home. Now!  We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place. How'd you meet that asshole, Andy, anyway? What job? He's got some fucked up friends. Stay in the car! I told you to stay in the car! I thought there might be somebody inside. No... of course not. Renee! Stay put, killer! I didn't kill her! Tell me I didn't kill her! Have you reached a verdict? Yes, we have, your honor. Please hand it to the bailiff. And what is your verdict? We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. Fred Madison, the jury having found you  guilty of murder in the first degree, it  is my order that on a date to be  determined, you be put to death in the  electric chair. How could I miss it?  The TV won't quit with that stuff. Andy's from Utah.  He says there you have  a choice... You can die by hanging or by  firing squad. Andy would go for this, don't you  think?... Firing squad, definitely. The heart, I guess. Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be hung, huh? You might be right, Raquel. Guess who? Make yourself to home, fella. Here he comes. See you soon, Sammy.  Don't think takin'  a jolt is gonna get you outta payin' me  back the twenty you owe me. Don't take it personal, pal. Un fuerte abrazo, amigo! Hang in there, honey. Keep an eye out for me, Sammy G. Show 'em you got big stones, bro. Line check. Okay. Any final words, Sam? Something wrong? My... My head. Headache, huh?  Too much sun, I guess.   You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it. No, no.  I want to go in. What's botbering you, Madison? The pain is getting worse.  I need more aspirin. I can't give you anymore.  I'll talk to the doctor. You sleeping okay? I can't sleep. You'll sleep now. Take him back to his cell. What is it? Aspirin... fly head.  I gotta have more aspirin. The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning. But my head... Shit, that wife killer's lookin' pretty fucked up. Which one? Who are you?  What are you doing in this cell? This is Johnny Mack at station 8. Yeah,  look, somethin' crazy's happened.  No, I  mean, Madison ain't in his cell.  No,  there's somebody in there, but it ain't  Madison! Right, right.  Okay... Captain  Henderson's comin''?... Right. F-u-u-u-ck me! Now, Mack, what's the situation? I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself. That's not Fred Madison? No, sir, it's not. Who is it? I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson? Yeah, Mack? Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here. Repeat that, Bill. Warden, it's not him.  It .was not Fred Madison in that cell. Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be? I don't know.  The guards say they've never seen him before. Where is he now? He's in the infirmary, being examined. Did you ask him who he is? He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway. If he's not Madison, then where's Madison? I've got men searching the building and the grounds now. I want to take a look at this man myself. What is this, Rogoff? Who is this man? He's not Madison? A headache? Where the hell did you come from, mister? Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton. He's twenty-four years old.  His birthday is April 21st.  He was born and raised right here.  He lives with his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue.  Pete Dayton was arrested five years ago for auto theft, for which he  was put on probation for one year.  That  was his first and only offense.  No  record since then. How about Madison?  Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts? Nothing, Marsh.  Vanished.  There's an  APB out on him.  His photo's been faxed  nationwide. I had a call from the governor's office about this. How the hell does she know? There's press outside right now. How the hell... 7 One of the guards must have leaked it. What's the word on the street? Only that Madison has apparently escaped. Nothing about the other guy. Good, let's keep it that way.  Keep a lid on Dayton.  Nothing gets out about him. I have a statement to read... Fred  Madison, an inmate being held on death  row has, apparently... has escaped.  An  all-points bulletin has been issued to  authorities not only statewide, but  nationwide.  We are confindent that he  will be apprehended very soon.  No  further details are available at this  time.  Thank you very much. Warden, nobody's ever escaped from death row before.  How did he get out? I'm Warden Clements.  This is Captain  Henderson and Dr. Rogoff.  Please, sit  down. Mr. and Mrs. Dayton, as you were told  over the phone, your son, Peter, is here. He... He was discovered this morning...  in a cell on death row. A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison. The wife killer? Yes. ...Tell me, what was Peter's condition  the last time you saw him? His condition?  What do you mean? His physical condition. Same as always.  Pete takes care of himself. Was he in a fight? That doesn't sound like Pete. You don't know Fred Madison? No... Only what was in the news. Do you think Pete knows him? You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday? What about yesterday? Sometimes he stays at a friend's. Any particular friends? A girl's, a buddy's.  I don't know.  He's  his own man; he comes and goes as he  pleases. Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can. Mel, let's get Peter in here. Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this? Where ... am I? My head hurts. A man named Fred Madison was occupying  that cell.  He's missing. we're trying  to find out how it is you were in there  and not him. I... I don't know. Do you know Fred Madison? No. We need to find out what happened here. Have you made any charges against him? No. Then he's coming home with his mother and me. All right... but you see our  predicament... Legally we can't hold  him, but he may be able to help us...  perhaps later.  For now, he's free to  leave. You just gonna let him go? We'll get a tail put on him. Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay. No... I don't feel so good.  I would  like some aspirin. Thanks, Al. Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to. Yeah. Where's Pete? You talk to him? How're you feelin'? Better. Arnie called this morning while you were  sleepin'.  They miss you pretty bad down  at the garage.  I told 'im you still had  a "fever". Okay.  Thanks. Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya. Yeah. You really don't remember the other night, do you? What night is that? The night before you showed up in the slammer... No... I don't.  Why? Hey. You look like shit. Just haven't been feelin' well. I don't think so. Where to?  Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too. Hadn't slowed her down none. Sheila'll be at "Tops". Okay. Goin' out with these clowns for a while. Do ya good. I hate ridin' in this fuckin' car. Take it easy, Pete, "V" loves this rod. This rod is a fuckin, embarrassment, Carl.  Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"? Listen. No, I'm okay. Yeah?... Nothin'. Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin". Sure. They're comin' with us. Sorry...

EVER!!!! I won't ever tailgate. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS No. SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A I'll get a manual. and study it. Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate. I can see that. I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h. Eight, nine car lengths.  A hundred and sixty-two feet. At sixty? Fifteen car lengths.  About two hundred and seventy feet. What'd I tell ya. Wait a minute ... Thanks, Mr. Eddy. No... Thank you!...

You don't look so good. I gotta headache... What's goin' on? The police called us. Yeah? what did they want? They wanted to know if we'd had a chance  to find out what happened to you the  other night.  They wanted to know if you  remembered anything. But I don't remember anything.  What did you tell 'em? You came home.  Your friend Sheila brought you here. Sheila? Yes, there was a man with you... She  brought you here... She didn't know what  else to do. What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this. Who was the man? Never saw him before in my life. Did you tell the police this? We're not saying anything about that  night to the police. We should all  forget that night. What happened to me? Please tell me. No. Why didn't you tell me you brought me here that night? To my house... my parents told me.  What are you tryin' to hide? Sheila... Tell me... Who was with me?...  Who was the man?... ...When you brought me home!  What was he doin' there? What are you cryin' about?...  Sheila? How ya doin', Pete? Okay. I'm sure you noticed that girl that was  with me the other day... Good lookin'  blonde?  She stayed in the car?... Her name is Alice.  You know I love that  girl to death. If I ever found out  somebody was makin' out with her, I'd  take this ... ...and shove it so far up his ass it  would come out his mouth... Then you  know what?... What? I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes. So, Pete, you're lookin, better.  What have you been up to? I'll get it. Hello. Okay. Are you positive he knows? So what do we do? We should stop seeing each other. Have you partied with him? You like it? What deal? What's he do? Pornos. How'd you get in with these fuckin' people? How'd it happen, Alice? In pornos? Why didn't you just leave? You liked it. I don't want you to go away. I love you, Alice. Andy? Yeah.  Call him. Okay... Okay. Why are ya goin' so early? What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?

I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete. You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right? Yeah. That's good, Pete.  Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine. We've met before, haven't we? I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met? At your house.  Don't you remember? No. No, I don't. We just killed a couple of people... What? You heard me... We thought we'd come over and tell you about it. What's goin' on? Great question!! In the east ... the far  east... when a person is sentenced to  death... they're sent to a place where  they can't escape... never knowing when  an executioner will step up behind them  and fire a bullet into the back of their  head... it could be days... weeks... or  even years after the death sentence has  been pronounced... This uncertainty adds  an exquisite element of torture to the  situation, don't you think?  It's been a  pleasure talking to you. Pete... I just wanted to jump on and tell you I'm really glad you're doin' okay. Alice, I... Alice? Alice... Is that you?  Are both of them you? Where's the bathroom? Alice? Why me, Alice?  Why choose me? I want you... I want you... Hello. Here I am. Where's Alice? Alice who? Her name is Renee.  If she's told you her name is Alice, she's lying. You just got in before the big storm hits. I need a room. Hey, Al, look at this. It's her, all right.  Fred Madison's  wife ... with Dick Laurent and Mr. Dent- head over there. We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place. You know what I think? What's that, Ed? There's no such thing as a bad coincidence. Renee? What the fuck? What's going on? You're coming with me. What do you guys want? Now you can hand it back to me. You and me, mister, we can really out- ugly the sumbitches, can't we? Dick Laurent is dead.
