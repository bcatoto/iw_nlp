See you in an hour ... Losing control -- malfunction in thermal chamber -- for Christ's -- Emm --! Five -- four --  three -- two -- one ... Three -- two -- one ... Three -- two -- one ... Emma ... Emma ... Brenda -- ? Mother. I thought you were burglars. Something in the wind? You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely. 'Her'? Dr. Peel? May I help you, madam ... I'm afraid that's impossible. You are female? Then you can't come in. No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922. Doctor Peel, I presume? I was about to throw in the towel. I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since -- Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think? Congratulations, you've penetrated a  bastion of male privilege. I guessed  you weren't a stickler for Tradition,  doctor. Dyed in the wool. But I can admire  someone who doesn't play by the  rules. Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing. I say, this is all terribly formal.   Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel? Much better. I didn't. Mother did. I expect you'll like him. Tea time -- four o'clock.  Mustn't be late. A word of warning. Don't take the macaroon. Mother's favorite. ... Showers followed by sunny periods. All happy families here, Mrs. Peel.  God, you're quick. Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker. A series of bizarre shifts in local weather  patterns ... Global warming? Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush  English village transformed overnight  into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer? Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died. Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor  again, Mrs. Peel -- One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another  special reason we wanted you to join our  happy family; rather curious, actually ... Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel.   With a twist. You're our chief suspect. Think she really killed those agents? Amnesia? Insane ... ? Why? Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr.  Darling. How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling? Peel? Did she know? Anyone particular in mind? You're a lady of hidden talents, Mrs. Peel ... Scientist ... ... marksman ... ... swordsman ... ... To what do you attribute your  overachievements? Really?  I fail to see the connection. I take your point. Yes indeed. I need protection. Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man  worth meeting. No point setting out  half shod. I couldn't agree more. Thank you,  Trubshaw. Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a  hand-made shoe. As unique as a face  or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA? Thank you, Trubshaw ... Do you really think so? Press that button, would you? Tea? Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt your flow of oratory ... Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you. A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor. The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen. I'm hoping you will. As per mother's instructions. For a man in my position -- They call me in when they've reached a  dead end. Freelance. Like yourself. After our fencing match, I was rather  hoping you would do the risking.   More tea? I meant me. According to Mother, Sir August owns  half of the Highlands. A millionaire.   Former head of Special Projects at the  Ministry. Now ... Not so much eccentric. More barking  mad.

British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British  weather has been tampered with  by ... aliens. Small talk.  Try the weather. This way, miss ... Eh? In here! You don't get rain like you used to in  England. A good shower that's the ticket.   Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells  the namby-pamby in a man. Out in India. So character-forming for the  British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The  rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen  inches overnight. A whole week of lovely  rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ... You You mean you don't recall?? Ah, Lady June ... Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised. There, look! Imagine being caught out in a blow  like that! I say, this is a bit much. 'The Merry Widow'...? ... Hello ... Hello? ... Who the hell...? Who is this? ... You must leave the test area. I repeat, leave the area ... Help is on the way ... Manners, Mrs. Peel. Ah, Brenda ... Mrs. Peel? Strange. I wasn't about to. I might say the same. Why should they think that? Frankly that's how I remember it. Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel. Did he say who? An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...? I must say, you look more your old self -- Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion? I can't wait to see afternoon. Ladies, gentlemen and bears ...

A cuckoo.  The first sign of spring, and ...  A cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is  no longer secret. Agents are investigating  us. Their names are John Steed and Emma  Peel. I believe we have a traitor among us  ... perhaps more than one ... That remains to be seen. When we find  the traitors, they will be dealt with severely. These agents.  Where are they? Here. In this building. By our estimate, they  will enter this room in thirty-five point five  seconds precisely ... I am sorry the party is over.  But we  shall meet again. To each of you a gift. A token of my appreciation. For you, Mrs. Peel. Hm ... A Veuve-Cliquot '56 ... But he bites the end of his Monte Cristos ... ? Clearly, we're dealing with a maniac. Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry. Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ... What on earth? Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ... Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ... Not again.  There's got to be another. way to go about this. Now, now ... 'I can't give you anything but love, baby...' Naughty teddy ... No! You can't ... Ask not for whom the telephone rings, it rings for thee ... But I've got rid of her.  She's ... Go to the window ... To the window. For you, Mrs. Peel. Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly! Ask Mother. Mrs. Peel -- ? Ask not for whom the telephone rings ... No, please! I beg you ...

In a blue funk.  Can't  take chances. I'm looking after  things while he's hiding out ... You're probably wondering how I  can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new  prototype from the boys in X division.   Micro-sensors in the system read  signals and road information. Converts  the info into miles per hour.  Ultra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart. We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel. So you say ... It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here. Don't bother.  Here's a bus ... We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ... Impossible. Is there anything that isn't? Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ? But if someone miniaturized the process... Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research. Where would they aim for? The hot and cold war ... Shame. I was recommended. By a friend. Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June? Seriously? You don't say. How real does it feel? There are limits? No need. I'll call again. A day in the country ... ... And by you, Mrs. Peel ... ... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything  points to you.  No sisters?  No  undiscovered twin? According to Dr. Darling, you're a  psychopathic personality with  schizophrenic delusions, suffering from  recurring amnesia based on traumatic  repression, leading to outbursts of  anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D. Oh, well ... Just my type, Mrs. Peel. Do you always drive this fast? Turn! Are you alright, young man? I think so, thank you so much ... Oh, dear -- Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy. I feel sure of it. I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you? She was ... You with Mother or Father? Both, actually. Good.

I may be able to help you. Wonderland Weather Ltd. This way ... Over here ... ... Mrs. Peel? I think I'm seeing double again. Now this is more like it ... Mrs. Peel ... ? Mrs. Peel ... ? Mrs. Peel ... ! Mrs. Peel ... Your lipstick ... Not again. It's a trap. Tell Mother, beware. Tell Father. I wouldn't shake that too hard. The weather might turn nasty. If nature gives a man a collector's mind,  it doesn't matter what he collects.   Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings.  A true collector grows more obsessive  as the years pass. We have met ... Listen... Very much alive. Darling, it's me... For you ... all for you ... Don't be afraid, darling. Don't run away. I forgive you,  Emma. I know you left me. But  I still love you.

I thought you were someone else ... I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ... No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all. I think you owe Mrs. Peel an explanation ... You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband? Guilty until proven innocent? '... Sunny intervals leading to sudden storms and gale warnings for all areas. ... Outbursts of rain, scattered hailstorms and freezing fog greeted the World Council of Ministers as they arrived in London for their conference ...' Orders. Nothing personal. Careful. You might fall. No trouble. Always. Except ... ... when I don't. It comes down to one  thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust. I could be convinced, if ... I knew who  poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ... I need proof. It was longer. On the lips. Much longer.  Approximately ... fifteen seconds. Keeping a stiff upper lip? Not for a moment. Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel? I thought you didn't. Winning isn't everything. After you -- Mrs. Peel ... You don't trust me? No -- don't answer it ... That's it. The phones trigger the explosions -- Get down -- get down -- it's going to explode -- ! It's your mother. Mother? How did you find me? I told Mother I took care of you. I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ... Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who? Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ... Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies? Very well.

Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls. Colonel Jones at your service, Mrs. Peel. Just a moment -- Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible.

Overtaken by Peter's work on the  physics of climate change ... Do you also know that during your  final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance? Father. She gave him an 'all clear'  after a security test by Dr. Darling. Makes two of us. We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ... You didn't tell her? I was getting to it. The World Council of Ministers meets  tomorrow to convene the new global  defense initiative -- There's a reception this evening. Colonel  Jones thinks it advisable we attend. Under the circumstances Mother didn't  see fit, but I think I can get you in ... I had a feeling. That's why we're  in a hurry ... May I have the honor, Mrs. Peel? I'll see to it personally. What's that you're wearing? Intoxicating. Here, have one of these. Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's. You first. ... In the uncertain climate that threatens  this global initiative, no magic umbrella  can shield us. Only our own vigilance. Security and  stability are our watchwords. Snuff. I must insist you try some. They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel. Oh, hello ... We want Mrs. Peel. Dead, I'm afraid. You disobeyed an order, Steed.   Mrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot  be trusted. I think she can. Can you? I shall summon security. Bad news. Father's looking for you.   Where are those bloody ministers? It's almost May, for heaven sake. Quick --it'll protect you -- After him, Mrs. Peel! Go -- ! Goodbye, Mrs. Peel! Can't you throw her off? Where'd she go? Happy landings, Mrs. Peel. I thought it was Cinderella who lost her slipper ... I'll be back ... Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather  may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ... No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well. Oh, and by the way, I think it's about  time you got rid of that chip on your  shoulder. A microtag. One of Mother's little toys. There you are. Free at last. Where's Mrs. Peel? What? Ah, here we are ... 'X' marks the spot. The shoes were  delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the  site of a former Ministry installation... Privately owned by ... Very good, Mrs. Peel ... You're not venturing alone, surely. Of course. I was hoping you could tell me. I'm going to follow up on a hunch of  my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is  innocent and you have a mole. In your operation. Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have  been a worthy opponent. You have  tracked us down. You are within an  ace of winning. Quite right, but we still make the rules. People, too. You and I. Together. But first you  must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel?   The answer is obvious ... Yourself. Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel. We've been expecting you. We hope  you'll enjoy your stay with us.  Decontamination is almost complete. And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive. He tells me you're very beautiful. Relax, Mrs. Peel. We're hundreds of feet below ground. The Ministry made it impregnable. No one can save you. Darling Emma -- Not really. Not quite. I'm afraid you still don't see ... Valentine Peel ... Yes, I remember him quite well ... This is where he used to spend his days. We have an old photograph somewhere ... Absolute wizard with makeup. His favorite roll from Shakespeare. Prospero ... 'The Prospero Project...' ... From The Tempest. A banished duke, ousted by his brother, marooned on a magic island. Who controlled the weather. 'O Brave New World that hath such people in it.' The shoes were delivered to an island  in the Serpentine - former Ministry  installation ... she said to tell you I said it's not goodbye yet. Listen, I'm going to need some help. In a hurry ... Steed How did you guess? You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ... It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry. Mother betrayed me. She was  going to replace me with a younger  Father.  Errand boy that's all I was.   'Find Steed...' Well, you found me. Have a sniff of  this, why don't you? Careful, the  scent can be overpowering ... Dr. Darling, this is Father. We have an intruder. I repeat -- Blast. What to do? Mrs. Peel! The things I do for England ... Oh, dear. Someone's going to pay for this. Congratulations. The clouds are on course ... Not yet! They haven't heard our terms ... ! But all those people -- ! Valentine Peel. I see you've gone  back to using your original face. Perish the thought. They said you were a very naughty  boy. I was at Harrow ... Bang-bang ... you're dead. One shot -- for emergencies. Rules are made to be broken. I do. Did I? My mistake. Mrs. Peel -- ! You must be joking ... That will do. You are, and it's behind you. I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel? Emma! Emma ... Mrs. Peel? The plot. Hello, we must be going ... 'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -' A fine night, Mrs. Peel ... English weather. You know, after  all we've been through, I should  say we deserve a long holiday ... As a matter of fact I have ... It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel. Not quite. Our chaperon. Still a little warm, Trubshaw. Is this the '28? A little more ice, I think ... Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ... Thank you, Mrs. Peel.
