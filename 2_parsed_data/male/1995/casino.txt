Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky... It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers... ...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino. It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done. Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing. Look at yours. Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers. They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here. So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it. I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History. ...he did what he was told. You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?! Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much. Give me that much at least! I was in the building! Was I at that dinner? Was I at that dinner? Was I at that dinner? Was I at that dinner? Just tell me - He's lying. Liar. I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?! You were never my guest?! Good to see ya. William would you... Hello, Senator. I can't do that. All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should... get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad? Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help? I mean, the heat he brought down is murder! We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that? Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake? First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year. It's a pity in this... I'm serious. No interference. It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way. But what happens when they do find out? But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... He even played golf with the President. A powerful man. As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy. Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing. Hey! Stop - Okay, Randy. Thank you. Congratulations. Oh, good. Fine, fine. How's your family? Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes. ...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I - ...been right, but who knows? The worst was Blue. ...stupid things. I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp. Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport. Right back. Right away. 702 472 1862. You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone. I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me. ...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately. Lester... ...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone. Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam... Hello. M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein? You fuckin' piece of shit. You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here. She's my wife. Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me. He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks. But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond. Well... Yeah, sure I do. Why? So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box? No one else, including myself? Ohhh... You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave? When did this happen, honey? I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll - What happened? What happened? Who did this to you? Wh-wh - Amy! Amy, open the door! Hello? Hello! Ginger. Oh. Have a good day at school. Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch. I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch. I'll be right there. She's there with you? She's there with you? ...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is. Well... How'd you know I was here? No, I'm not okay. Nick? Yeah, uh, who's this? Hello. She's driving me fuckin' crazy. I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know... She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy. Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy. And what'd she want? Yeah. I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you. Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you? You're gonna bury us both. What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here! You never - ? ...you? Do you remember what I told you? No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told... Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you. Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right. I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on. What are you - I - Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass. I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody... I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem. I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick. What people? Why? What - what, Caesar's? Yeah. And at the... ...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf. The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care. Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses. Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody. I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it. This guy is gonna run to the FBI. Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy. That's right, yeah. Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that. Okay? ...don't do it to me... Please... I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you. Listen, I would - All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation? Now, what does she have to do with all this? My wife? Yeah. All right. All right. Yes, you lost your control. You lost your control. What happened to me? What happened to you? Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad. Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad. I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened. That's all taken out of context. Okay. ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it. I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about... I'll be honest with you. I don't wanna come along with you. No, I don't wanna come - Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place. It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license. And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand? I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head? What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI. Hey. ...very difficult to get in. It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation. It's... Hello. - no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy. Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them. It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care. In so many words, yes. Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is. Nope, there's no way. Yeah, I believe it. You got banned. Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it. I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you. Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you. I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book. You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already. Between... You're still eight pounds over. What's the reason for this? Okay. If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again. So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out. Then he called me a faggot. ...and he tells me to go fuck myself. He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely... No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did? You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya. Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place. I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that. And I didn't want any of those agents near my place. It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy. ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas. When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.' Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message. And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known. Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle. Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit. Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here. No, of course not. After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it. Honey, come here. Ginger. Somethin', huh? Hey. I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him. But nobody had to take care of Nicky. While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead. Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy. Eight. How did Nicky collect? Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us. I'll take Columbia for twenty. Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it. Where the hell did you learn how to deal? You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me. But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved. ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details. No problem. Sorry. Okay, thanks. Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted. I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that. I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him. Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest. I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here. No, that's quite all right. Yeah, I heard a lot about you. How do you do? Seven o'clock. I'll come by. Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right? Well, that's why they paid so well. Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam - Next morning bright and early, I get the call. ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car. This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine. I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas. Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it. And they were usually right. They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened. Half - I'm comin' down. Half of everything is mine. Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff. She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind. Do you unders- You've got to stop her. Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her! Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill? No. Just stop everything. That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris. ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer. She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter. Listen... 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough. I... Why is she eight pounds over? Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'. Okay. Right away. Okay? Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away. Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on. No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten. I'll be right down. Oh, no. What is it? L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life'] I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy. Call security. Why not make them happy? Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants. I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week. I wouldn't give the bum a mop job. We can't get rid of him? For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit... I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work. They had all the pieces they needed. After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway. If she calms down... If she calms down, I will let her in the house. Should I let her in like - ? I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff. I'm afraid to let her in the house. Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you - I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm - I'm not - You'll wake the whole neighborhood! You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that. Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna - Just wait there for me! She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's. You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker. Now you need approval from him to go home? Get the fu- You threatening me? I'll fuckin' kill you in this place! Get up and go home right now. Get up! Get going! Get up! Get - get up! Get - Get up! Get up! And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me? Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house... You want your jewelry? You understand? What? Let you go? You fuckin' whore! You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you. Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch. Let me tell you something. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. Listen, you fuckin' cunt. I should have - I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again, I'll f-, I'll f- ...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind? I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door? Are... I mean, it could get us both killed. What if he won't stop? ...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done. I know you were with somebody. Who was it? I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be. I just hope it's not them. Who were you with? Mm. You know why I want to do it. Just do it. Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line. What did Jennifer have? What'd you have? And where'd you go? So, who'd you go to lunch with? I put her to bed. You threw it away? Hi. You didn't answer your beeper. Get out of here! You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here. You're not takin' Amy. You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here. Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there! Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh? Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch. Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want. You're lower than a dog! I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place! I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch! No kidding. NO KIDDING! Take your fuckin' bag and get out of here! I want you out of here! I want you out of here! Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here. You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now. I'm just tryin' to figure it out. Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what? Around ten thousand? At the most, which is impossible for him. But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand? Yeah. First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days? I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much. The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know. But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense. Mm-hm. Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch. Twenty-five thousand for clothes. With the money. So, what'd ya do with it? All right... Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five. That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't. ...the rest of the two million is still there? And... ...twenty-five thousand? It's under... How serious? ...under? What's it... What about the money? Uh, where's the box? Uh, I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know. What do you mean? ...please. That's all I'm askin' you. ...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away... Listen... Hello. Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want? Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes. I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be? Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me. Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I - ...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes. ...on the stuff involving crimes. So on... You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in... How could you say that? You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody. You can do it. You can do it. Yes, I - yes, I do. Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff. You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones. If not for me, at least for Amy. It's okay. Look... ...you gotta get a hold of yourself. Listen. Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know? I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think - What? What?! Yeah, how do I know? What? Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em? Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too? Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.' You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him? He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.' He didn't say that to you, did he? Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for. You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you? Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you? What are you talkin' a- ? Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it? That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that? Huh? Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat? Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for. Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean... Why do you need that much? Twenty-five thousand? For yourself? Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there. What do you need? Okay, want to go with Mommy? ...they didn't know what really moved her. But as much as they loved her... She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her. So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money. Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks. All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Now look, pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important. The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank. You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises? It's nice isn't it? It's chinchilla. Want to go? Let's go back in. You sure? Right? You're with me now. It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right? Maybe you shouldn't drink so much. Why're you crying? You all right? Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you. Want to take a chance? You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine. No, I - I... mean... that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway? It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation... based on that mutual respect... I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that. I - I - I... Yeah, I know all that. I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much. And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore. I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother. I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me? I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family. We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around? Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up. The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be. And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot. The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep. ...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything. But mostly... ...pit bosses, floor managers. She took care of the dealers... That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash. Any change? She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money. See you, Ginger. Ginger's mission in life was money. ...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me - We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me. Bullshit! Bullshit! - you could put 'em on your expense account? Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so - What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for? Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a That's amazing. Eight children! How many kids do you have? Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out! Get out! Go on. Let's go. I'll regret it even more if I keep you on. I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin' I'm firin' you, you - Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here. You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win? The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions. It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you! Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win? Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels. Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won! You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on? Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me? Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are? Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this. Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand? The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front. These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off. What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden. What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there. Mr Rothstein. Green? Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing. I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go? That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches. I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance. ...worst possible time for me. All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want? Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand. So, you're a righty? Can you do it with your left hand? Can't do it with both hands? I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands? We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over. I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost. Is this yours? Your pen? Excuse me. Get out of here. You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw? We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it? And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?Thanks, Nick. I didn't give 'em the m- Yeah. A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money. That's what I did. ...I got muscled on the street. When I left here with the money...Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures. [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey. You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission. A record of the arrests...No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't. Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife. That's right. Now this is just a signature card.You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me. Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes? You gotta go back out there. What expenses? You gotta go back there and talk to that guy. Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?Ace, listen to me. No, Ace. What can I do? I-I'm sorry, Sam. Yeah, refill'd be great. Sam? You can't talk to me like... What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me? Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss. Well, I've been busy. Hi. Good. Yes. You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss. Yeah, that works out.Speeding? Hold on a second. Wait, hold on a second. All right, take care. Yeah. Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again. No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this? No, you're not calm. Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here. Watch it, partner, watch it! Excuse me. Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' - I can't. Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca- Go get a bag, man. Jeff, would you go in with her? That's not a problem, that's not a p- Please. I understand. Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise. Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh! Hey. She's on the account. There's nothing we can do. Okay. Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house. All right. Okay, okay. Hey! ...fuckin' jerk-off. You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you... Pitch-black?! It -There's nothing we can do. She had the key. Come on. I'm sorry. If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair. Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things? That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway. Hey! Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry. It looked like a fuckin' gun! What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.You've gotta be kidding me! Leave me alone! You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with? You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?! Fuck you! Fuck you! Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you! Nicky, I'm sorry. I did - I didn't - Nicky, I did -It's instinctive, you know. You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does. Now go out there and show your dad what you can do. Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game. Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.Great! Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you. Yeah. Fuck him. Fuckers! Is that the last one?Carmine's gone. He's gone? We're waiting on Carmine. Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? Carmine left? Oh. Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?We can't help him if - Stay out of the way! Calm down! Calm down!We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a - We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting - We're - we're placing you under arrest for -There was nothing to it. It was my pleasure. No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please. Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children. ...Well, I've got a large family.Seven o'clock? Okay. You come by the house? You see? Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week? Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan? Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it? Okay. Frankie, you're a good boy. You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand? I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me. I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay. Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky. Are you sure? Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem. I want you to tell me the truth, mind you. It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth. Frankie, I want to ask you something. You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better. And I mean... that's no good. It's in all the papers. Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it. Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that? E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!'] ...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand? Fine, fine. Hey, Frankie. And how are things going down there? Uh-huh. Good. Fine. Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you'] Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains. Okay? Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him. T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here'] Ace. That's enough now! Ma che cazzo! You got a round figure on it?I'm a little in shock, quite frankly... Why are you doing this to me? I can't believe you're doing this. What are you talking about? What? This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town. There's gotta be a way to work him back in. But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner. Thank you.Come on! Yes. Yes. Get lost, Ginger! Get lost! That bag's full of fuckin' chips you Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me. What money? I've seen you stealing from me. What's the matter? Ginger, honey. I'm sorry. Thank you. Very nice.Yes, don't worry. They checked in alone. ...they're in Penthouse K. Listen...He's not here? Carmine left? Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine. Oh.Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off? Yeah, that's my pen. Why? What?You got it. Schmuck. All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick? I'll call you right back. Mm-hm. 1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b- So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes? Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay? Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't... She's not here, Sam. Hello. Hey, little Dale Evans. Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck? Okay. Yeah, yeah. I know that. Yeah. Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing. Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay? No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face. You know where she gets this from! Shut your mouth! We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay? Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right? Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about. Huh? Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl- No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy - You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive. She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here. 'Go! Go! Go!' You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now? It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know. He's sittin' by the phone - Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I - I just talked to him. He was just on the phone. Right. Don't give me any of your shit! Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going. We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk. You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back? You got money. That's a - That's a good look. What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean? Every time I ever see you, that's what I see. - with stupid braces on your teeth. Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security. Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas. ...all the luck in the world. God... I wish you... So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it? That's right. Do you know that? Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too? Don't make me come there. Answer me. You are. No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you? Okay?I understand. No problem. He's good. He's fine. Hm. I'm positive. Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know? No. I ain't see anything like that. So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too. Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business. What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed. I always tell you the truth, Remo. Of course, Remo. I'll tell him, Remo. I know. What're you gonna do? I know. Yeah, I heard, yeah. I'll take care of it, Remo. How are you? Take him out! Take this motherfucker out! No more fuckin' dirty work! Fuck you, you motherfuck! No more! You see? Watch! Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right? You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy. Take it easy! Whoa. Calm down. Calm down, calm down. Shh! Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint. Don't know. Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about? Yeah. They'll do it. Angelo and Buster. Oh, he ain't nobody. What? Yeah, but they keep askin' about it. I know. I know. Nah. You would've heard somethin'. I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up. He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. You must have drunk too much. Let's get out of here. He's here. They're havin' a good time too. Mm. It's up to you. Yeah, but they're complaining. Yeah, thanks a lot. Fine. Everything's goin' good. Nicky sends his warmest regards. Remo. This is Nick. And this is Stacy. Hey. This is Shelly. I took care of everybody. She asleep? What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds? This peter's a motherfucker. Get up. Get up. Smarten up. Of course. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, how come I laid nine?Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here. She didn't know who to turn to. She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage. Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right? Yeah, she's here. Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me. ...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute. Well... Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay? It's me. Sammy. Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know? But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh? I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back. I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right? She was afraid to call you. I just told you. She called me. Ginger called me. Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy. Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker. Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me! That's the only reason! Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?! You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you! Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you - Back - Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it? You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself. Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television! You wanted to go on TV. You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?! They think you went batshit! I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?! Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible! You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?! No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal! What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out? Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head? Don't ask questions. Just be there. ...hundred yards further down the road. No, a... Meet me at three. Practice enough this week, you prick? I see you, you motherfuckers. Peekaboo, you fucks, you. The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too. Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself... Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal. A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me. It's none of my business? And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out? She came to talk to me... ...to me. Hey, she came to talk... The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem. No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point. Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident. Yeah. You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife. ...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?! A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'... Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore. I lost control? Yeah. What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me? Yeah? Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad. Yeah, that's out of context. Okay. You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.' That's quiet? Fine. All right, fine. Just say so. You should say so. Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license. You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it? Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know! If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you? There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way. Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time. You think he got the point? Hey, Ace. Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine. No, no it's okay. Listen... Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot? Hey, Rich. I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em. In other words, I'm fucked. Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like? Motherfucker. Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this? ' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas... and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.' Do you believe this shit? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? All right. What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all. That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone. Why, somebody's complaining? Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right? So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him. But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons. Thanks, pal. All right, Ace? I'm sorry about this. Really. What? Ho- Hey, come here. What? No. So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place? Four aces, Doc. ...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players. To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers. It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him. With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her - Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand? Yeah, right, I'm sure. Ohh! But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to? So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose. Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything. I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there. Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home. You mean, I have your permission? What do you think about me movin' out here? What's the matter? You got a problem with that? Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here? Yeah. Okay, Sammy. ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim. You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you. Listen... What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?! What happened to the fuckin' tough guy? Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?! If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight. It was eight. Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game. They payin'? If his girlfriend was knocked up. He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon. You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that. ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it. Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night. Matter of fact... Yeah, thanks. Fuckin' kids at home! Here. Get the fuck out of here. Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?! You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?! No, no? You didn't? You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off? Yeah? Mm. Mm. Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal. I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso. Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep. You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what? I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail. That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it. Yeah. I think I want my money back. Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though. I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President. No, I don't want one. Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'? Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash. I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark? So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker. Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere. But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right? You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you! You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand? Go over there and apologize. Go! Get the fuck out of - Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick! Fuckin'... Is that what you did? You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself? He tries to do everything... Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born. ...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know. Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'... Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great. He's comin' over. Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck? Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem? Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to. I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me. ...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant. Oh, thanks, Eddy. I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know. Uh-huh. Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left. Yeah, I'm over here with him. I'm over here now. But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out... Want me to take this for you? Yeah. All right. Mm. Mm. I'll be right out. Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world. I mean, unless Ace made his bet. But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost. Definitely the most important guy in this room. Okay, yeah. All right. Be careful. All right, all right. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out! How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?! Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut! Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol- Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you? I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you? Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it. I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb- I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death. What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef? I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him. It's what you want? Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh? Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya. A sponsor. Is that what you want? Come on. Don't be scared. Yes, you are. Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this. Don't cry. He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that. Everything went to his head. Yeah. Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - - didn't he? Yes, you did. You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing. You did. You're right. No, he wouldn't. I would have. And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously. Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off. Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too. Hm. You know? See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust. Let me think about that. Yeah. Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead. What were you gonna say? Go ahead. What? What? I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere - And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay. I'll be there. You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do. You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear? It's all right. Yeah. Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy. You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff. And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse. All right? Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him. Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried. I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens. Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace. I know what you mean. Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what? No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all. You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much? I can see that. Sure. Sure. I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does. You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but... Oh, you did? I didn't know that. Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you. I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but - Okay, Sammy. Pleasure. Very nice to meet you. All right. Are they out now? They check in alone? - back to Nigeria. Yeah. All right. Boy, look at this place, huh? Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you? Oh, there aren't? What's that? Huh? What's that. There's no more. Thanks, hon. Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know. There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more. There's more! Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her. What a smart kid you are! Okay, eat. Why? You know why, right? Two? How many of these you gonna eat, huh? No, no, no, no! Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit! Frankie! I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot. I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad. Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here. Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out! Get out. Get out! Get out! Shh. Hide her car in the back! Dominick said they're in the motel? Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at? And you make it disappear, you know what I mean? And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.' Yeah, but I'm not sure yet. You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at. Who's this guy? Who's this guy? Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'. I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do? I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know? Yeah, what's to stop him? You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back? Yeah, what'd you tell him? Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say? Go fuck yourself. What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'. Sue me, you Jew fuck! You should pay as fast as you collect, you know. So are we. Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they? They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready. I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him. Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here. But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back. ...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop. But he never talked. ...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs... I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together. ...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions. Pleasure. Stacy. Hey, Shelly. You walk past me? Yeah? Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that? Every night, on the couch. I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff. Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs. What's takin' so long over there? Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around. You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in. Come here, come here. ...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here. You jag-off. You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'? Ace saw Vegas one way. Hold it, hold it. Here. 'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten... Kill you, You motherfucker you! Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor. Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker! Charlie M? Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name! This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights! Fuck me? Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on. Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony. Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?! Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money! You're a little confused? I'm positive. I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it. All right, yeah. You got that thing for me? How you doin'? Tony.Mr. Chairman - Denying? No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here? Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records. Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on? Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip. What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.] I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.] ...done right, you gotta do it yourself. ...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth. You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this. All right, all right. But I - I - I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth. You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me? Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right. Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset. ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel. I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes... I'm sorry. I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'. Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head. I'm sorry. Receipts and bills and... everything's here. Oh, sorry -Here we go! Now move along. Yeah? Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy! Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?Yes, you were. You were in the m- You were in the building. You were wandering around. You were wandering around. You were wandering around. The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein. Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point. Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time. That's right. I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers. Hey, I need a room. Need a room. Hi, Ace. Do I hear a motion seconded? ...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application. Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...I-I'll do it. Okay. Just take it easy. Who's this? He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted. He wants a fifty-thousand marker. Now, he's really pissed. The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we... Sam, we got a problem. Here we go. Good luck. To Abraham Lincoln. This woman's an institution. Fuckin' asshole won't budge. We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite. Certainly. Senator. Nice to see you, Senator. He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin. We need this guy. ...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room... You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need... Having a good time? Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh? Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.It's always been our policy - But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired. ...and she doesn't always - Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows... ...position... ...trying to offer you the respect that your... Well, sir, I was just... Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out. They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere. What do you propose? The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.' And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run! These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from - He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this? He's out of his fuckin' mind. Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it. You got it. Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out? And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license. You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog. ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers. On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . . Philip, if you would rise. This is a very auspicious occasion.My fuckin' head. I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it. Yeah. Well, I'm a little confused here. You sure? What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'. How you doin'? Hey.Kill me, you fuck, kill me. Charlie M. Ch-Charlie M! Fuck you!This is not the way to treat people. You might regret this, Mr Rothstein. You're firin' me? I really think you're overreacting in this whole - I really think you're - Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes. Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam. Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you. Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more. Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry. I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you. All right, I will, I will. Yeah, okay. Well... Okay, I'll - Loose machines are right back over there. It won't happen again, Sam.You bet. Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor. Thank you for your time. Well, could there be any position... further down the trough? You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar. But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back. Are, uh - - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro? Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges. Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines... and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired. Hey, house is doin' well. Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant. Oh, thank you, sir. Hey, it is my pleasure. Mr Rothstein... I'm Pat Webb.Thank you. Yeah. I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake. I just wanna get out of here. Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland... Can I get my winnings? Yes, uh... Hi. Yeah.
