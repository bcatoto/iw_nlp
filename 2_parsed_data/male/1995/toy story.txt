Which one can I open first? Here! In the car! Woody! Buzz! Hey! Wow! Bye, house. But what if we leave them behind? He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone. Right here in the van. Mom, have you seen Woody? Pizza Planet! Yeah!!! Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom. Yeah?! Can I help pump the gas? I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there. Okay... But Mom, I can't find him! Mom! Do you know where Buzz is? Just one? Can I bring some toys? Pizza Planet?! Oh, cool! To infinity and beyond! Oh, yeah! Okay. Yeah! Can we leave this up 'til we move? Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom! Wow! Cool!Mm-hmmmmm. Merry Christmas, Sheriff. Rocky! The ramp! What are you doing over there? I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you. Well sure, look at him. He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife. Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight? I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.Me? No, no, no, no... Are you? We're not aiming for the truck! This isn't flying. This is falling -- with style! Not today! You did it! Next stop. Andy. Woody?! What are you doing? Woody! The rocket! Look out!! NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!! Hold on, Woody! Woody! What?! Woody! It's the moving van. Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing. But why would Andy want me? Yeah, right. No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy. Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference. I can't help. I can't help anyone. Years of Academy training...wasted!! But -- the hat looked good. Tell me the hat looked good! The apron is a bit much, it's not my color... Look at me! I can't even fly out of a window! Oh, I'm a sham!! Don't you get it?! You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! One minute you're defending the whole galaxy... ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters. Shhh! Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed. Woody, stop it!! Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that! It's not working. I recharged it before I left. It should be good for hours -- Shield your eyes! Woody, we don't know what's out there! Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport -- I've set my laser from stun to kill. What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I was -- Spaceship. Where is it? I don't see the -- You mean it has hyperdrive? Sorry. Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit. Well, then let's climb abroad. Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply? Go away. Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy. My fault?! If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place -- Sheriff, this is no time to panic. According to my nava-computer, the -- But we're not on my planet, are we? I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet. Then we've no time to lose!! Trouble?! Where?! I could have stopped him. You mean that happy child? Sure is a hairy fellah. Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device? I'd better take a look anyway. What's going on? Where? You're mocking me, aren't you? Don't even think about it, cowboy! Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh? What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip?! Why, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. All right, then, I will. Stand back everyone! I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed! Can! Yes, I can. They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly. Excuse me. Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger. Toy? Alright, everyone. You're clear to come up. Watch yourself!! I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion? HO-YAAAHH!!!Something's screwy here. Everyone, it's Woody! Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good! What's with him? Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards! Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock! Oh, that is disgusting. He's in the psycho's bedroom! No, no, not the ear. Gimme the nose. C'mon! Oh, quit your whining and pay up. Heh-heh. Miss. G-6. I got dibs on his hat! Sorry there, old Spudhead. Oh, boy. Will ya take a look at all those presents?!Murderer! Son of a building block, it's Woody! How 'bout three out of five? Are you peeking? Ohhh! You sunk it! B-3. Let's string him up by his pull- string! Hey, watch it! I can't see a thing! How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy? Will you quit moving around?! Huh?! Huh?! I told you he was guilty. That ain't no happy child. Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you? Oh, really? I'm from Playskool. Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody. Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear? Oh, ya big lizard! Now we'll never know what it is! Toss 'im overboard! Come on. Let's get out of here. Save it for the jury. I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep! You murdering dog! Wait just a minute. What are you trying to pull?! You are a liar! Did you all take stupid pills this morning?! Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz? And now you want to let him back over here? Wait! Wait! I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?! That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer! Who is it this time? Yeah. Like the attic. Heh, heh... Laser-envy. A lunchbox...?! Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!I'm sorry. It's just that I get so nervous before I travel. Aa-a-a-a-ah! Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?! He tortures toys -- just for fun. Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do? And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not actually from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but... Have you been replaced? Outta my way! Here I come, here I come -- Oh, no! Hey look! It's Buzz! Hey, Woody!? Where'd ya go? Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?! Yes! Yes! We promise! But what if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Were you scared? Tell me honestly. ROOAAAARR!!! He got it, Woody! There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel. Oh, I don't like confrontations. I thought he was at summer camp! Woody? Who's up there with you? They're getting bigger.I can't quite make out -- Juvenile intrusion! Repeat! Resume your positions NOW! Mission accomplished. Well done, men. Pack it up, we're going home. It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame! Repeat! Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame! Okay, we're on the last present now... Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now. Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo. Yes SIR! Sir! No Sir!She's lying! Whatever she says it's not true! Patient is... ...pre-e-epped. I'll have to perform one of my...operations! She's sick! Look! Janie! Oh no, Hannah! Whaddaya mean, you don't know? Did I get my package in the mail? W-w-w-we? It's busted. What?! Huh? Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY! Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl. You'll blow up. I know you're tired! I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me? Yessss! Ah, ha, ha, ha...I got it, Woody! It's too short! We need more monkeys! We believe you, Woody. Right, Rex? It's Sid! What the heck is up there? Wait! There's a nice little one over there! I can't hold on much longer! Woody! Speed up! See? It is Buzz. Now give back the lights, Potato Head. I knew you'd come back, Woody! Woody?! Heh, heh, heh! Golly bob howdy -- Woody, what are you doing under the bed? Got it. Bad news?! Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want. I'm red this time. Right here, Woody!Say, isn't that mistletoe? Whoooooah! Oh! Bo! There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention. We're almost there. It's a long story, Bo. I'll explain later. Here, catch this! Uh, let what? I don't -- Uh, what do you mean? Who? You'd think they've never seen a new toy before. Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I... Oh, hey - it was nothing. Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo. Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?! Uh, Buzz?! We missed the truck! Ha ha!! To Infinity and Beyond!! Hey, Buzz!! You're flying!! Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up! Ha-ha!! Hold still, Buzz! The match! Great! Well, thanks for the ride. I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me! Nice work, fellahs. Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch! That was a stroke of genius. It's ok. Everything's under control. Shhhhhhh! We've got to get out of here...NOW. Yes Sir! Buzz!! What are you doing? I thought you were -- Why would Andy want you?! Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear. Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy. No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY! You are HIS toy. Whoa, hey -- wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger. Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly. Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house. Oh, come on, Buzz. I...Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help. Come on, this way! Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius! Sh-h-h-h-h!! Quiet, Buzz. I think you've had enough tea for today. Let's get you out of here, Buzz. What happened to you? Don't tell me what to do! Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled! Back! Back, you savages! Back! Get away! Hoo-cha! Hoo-cha! Oh, you idiot! You're a toy! Use your karate chop action! They're gonna eat us, Buzz!! Do something! Quick! I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH! I sure hope this isn't permanent. Oh, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death. YOU are the one that decided to climb into this -- Alright Buzz, get ready... C'mon, c'mon, that's it... Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf. Wait a minute! No Buzz! This way! There's a special ship. I just saw it! Ow! Watch where you're going! No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back. No one will see us there. Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home. Buzz! Buzz, come back! WHAT?!! What are you talking about?! Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me -- This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!! Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!! No. Oh. Oh, that's good. Right? Buddy? Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz! Buzz!! Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble! Buzz, I would love to see you try. 'Course I'd love to see you as a crater. THAT is Sid! No! No, that's Scud, you idiot! That's why. Sid. Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS. Oh, no, no, no... Buzz, look! An alien! You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act! Hey, guys! Look! It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear! Oh, yeah, tough guy?! And another thing. Stop with this spaceman thing. It's getting on my nerves. Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me. That wasn't flying! That was falling with style! Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it. Can't! Can't! Can't! You can't! No, you can't. He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly -- The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present. T-O-Y. Toy. Yes. They're Andy's toys. Well, let's see, we've got double A's -- Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot. Hello-o-o... So, you see? We're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz? You bet. Gimme a hug. Hi! Oh, what?!...What?! These are plastic. He can't fly! It's not a laser! It's a little lightbulb that blinks! Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me! No, no! Turn 'em around, turn 'em around! Stay calm, everyone!! It doesn't matter how much we're played with. What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us. That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish. No, no, no, wait! No wait! You don't understand! Buzz is out there! We've gotta help him!! No! No! Don't leave! Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here! No, it's not what you think, I swear! No! No, no, no, no! Nothing. No, I'm not! Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead. No, no, no! You got it all wrong, Potato Head. Buzz is fine! Buzz is right here. He's with me! Good going, Slink! Now, just, just tie it on to something! Now, it was an accident! Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me Wait a minute. You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head? I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny? Alright! That's it! All right, that's enough. Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy -- A lunchbox?! Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move. I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried. Yeah, hey Buzz. Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake. Gimme five, man! Hi ya, fellas. To infinity and beyond! Ha ha. That's very funny, Buzz. This is serious!! Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best. C'mon, they're not lying down on the job. Okay, save your batteries! If I send out the troops, will you all calm down? Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about. C'mon, guys! Every Christmas and birthday we go through this. I was close to being scared that time. Oh, how ya doin', Rex? Buzz. Buzz Lightyear. You are not worried, are you? Andy's coming, everybody! Back to your places. Hurry! There. So did I tell ya? Huh? Nothing to worry about. Last present! This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet! Sargent. Establish a recon post downstairs. Code red. You know what to do. Okay, thank you. At ease. Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky? That's right. Your toys. Somebody's poisoned the water hole... This town ain't big enough for the two of us! Reach for the sky!! Sid!!! This is ludicrous. Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl. Uh-oh. Slink! Hang on! Speed up! Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too. Boy, am I glad to see you guys! We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz? Oh, shut up! In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy. Uh-h-h-h...nothing! Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose. It's just a mistake. Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!! Sh-h-h-h-h!! Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news. No, Slink -- Hey, Slinky?
