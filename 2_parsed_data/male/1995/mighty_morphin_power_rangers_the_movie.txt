In a time of great strife, a legendary interdimensional being known as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against evil.  with the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an unstoppable fighting force.  In time of great need, the young heroes could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as "Zords".  while the identity of the six remained a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of Legend, earning them the title...  The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. YeeeoowwWWWWW!!! We're OUTTA here!! Once we hit the target zone we've got fifteen seconds to make the drop. Step aside, pinheads. The Stealth Eagle is about to fly. Ditto for the Swooping Swallow. Bulk... where'd the earth go? Five seconds to the target zone! Aisha  you' re  on ! Be the eagle.  Be the eagle. Be the swallow.  Be the swallow... Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!! YEAAAAAAHHHHHH!! Let's BREAK!! Okay, so the firemen landed four out of six inside the target -- How `bout a show tune?! Somebody wanna keep chose bowlers in line. Hey dad, get with the program! Ladies and gentlemen, it's Angel Grove High And that's one!  A perfect landing! Three for three.  Look at `em go! That's five perfect landings! Now it's all up to Tommy Oliver. Looking good up there. Thanks, man. Congratulations - the Observatory's got a new lease on life. Awesome!   Ryan's Comet is passing over in two days! You read my mind. Let's roll! Stealth Eagle, huh?  The Lame Duck is more like it! Let's take the shortcut! Whadda you figure it is?! Hey, ya got me. ... I'll be damned. AHHHHHHHHH! We're here at the World Center Construction Site, where a mysterious object was just uncovered in a freak accident in which one workman suffered minor injuries... ... Angel Grove Police have cordoned off the area until it can be determined whether or not the unidentified object poses any threat.  The injured workman was quoted as saying... It's one smooth move and then you've gotta explode off the top. Nice and easy. Hey, no Karate on the patio! Actually, Ernie, it's Tae-Kwan Doe. Well Tae-Kwan-Do-it some place else. So, what're the plans for the weekend? I'll be at the Observatory Sunday. That's right - Ryan's Comet. We should throw a little comet shindig. Any excuse for a party. The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye. We could smell it's breath. There's a spot over there. Rangers, we need you at the Command  Center,  L.R.N. ! We're on our way. What's happening? Ay,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi !  Our thermionic-sensors have been hit by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil! Rangers, you must act swiftly. The planet is in GRAVE danger! Six thousand years ago a morphological being known as Ivan Ooze, ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror. Finally, a rebel factor known as the "Order of the Meledon" lured him into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground. In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove. The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released! To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices. Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension. That's a good question. Uh... Kurt...  you might wanna take a look at this. No need to wake him.  In fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself. After two thousand years of searching...  I have finally found you. Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball! SILENCE! Mordant's my second cousin three times removed on my mother's side.  He`s just visiting for the summer. Don't you ever have anything nice to say?! For your information this is not just your average, run-of-the- mill tub of snot ! WHAT! Ahhhhhhhh. Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE is back!! I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of all that is good and decent.  It is a supreme honor to finally meet you. How can I ever repay you? Do you recall the name...  Zordon of Eltare? I want you to destroy Zordon, so that my evil may once again reign Here's his address. "... left off Interstate 12?!" What's an "interstate"? We shall leave you to weave your wicked ways. What is that odious stench? Smell's like...   TEENAGERS! Remind me to have a word with Alpha about his teleporting calculations. ... Let's take a look over there. It looks like it's been opened! Hey! You had me scared there. The only thing I've seen is you teenagers. And you know... if there's one thing in the world I reeeeally hate.... It's TEENAGERS You're too kind.  Allow me to introduce myself.  I am the infamous, world-reviled, universally despised, IVAN OOZE! Well, pack your bags cause we're sending you back where you came from! Gee, a teenager with a big mouth. Not much has changed in six thousand years. We're the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! Ooooh, where's my autoqraph book?. Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is still using a bunch of rug-rats to do his dirty work.  And speaking of rats... From this moment forth, the world as you know it SHALL CEASE TO WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE! He's  gone. Let's take these beasts!! Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here! Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin! Well...  ALMOST nobody. Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.  I guess if you invest your money well over SIXTY centuries you can buy something pretty nice. HI ,  YAH ! Welcome to Wiener World.  May I take your order, please? You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself. Put a cork in it "Z" .  Ten minutes out of the egg and I'm already listening to one of your lectures. It worked for six thousand years. Don't remind me! Do you have any idea what it's like to be cooped up in a rotten egg for six thousand years?  It's BORING!  Not to mention I've had a Charlie horse since the Renaissance!  But now the tables are turned.  Now... ... it's time to pay the PIPER! Oh, the things that I have missed.  The BLACK PLAGUE! The SPANISH INQUISITION! And now, finally, I have the strength to DESTROY your pathetic powers FOREVER!! YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS! I've got a NEWS flash for you You put your left probe in, you put your left probe out, you put your left probe in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey- pokey and you turn yourself around... IT'S MORPHIN TIME! TRICERATOPS! TYRANNOSAURUS! MASTODON! WHITE TIGER! MORPHENOMENAL! Let's teach these vermin a few manners. Hold it... I heard something over there. Activating Audio Enhancer! They're on the other side of that wall. Anybody see them? Activating Power Scope! THEY'RE ABOVE US!! SABA SABER? We've got company. Bad move, Willard! STEGA-STINGER! Coming through! Target Neutralized? Not the brightest of beasts. Alpha, come in! We'd better get back. Something's wrong! Come on, guys... Guys! Alpha, are you okay?! I'll GET you my pretty, and your little DOG toa!! He must've blown an anitromic demodulator! Oh, no... Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate! ...  Rangers... thank goodness you're safe. We have to get you back inside your time warp. I'm afraid that's impossible... The power has been destroyed. It's gone... The Zords, the weapons...  all of it. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are no more. ... You must be strong... Ivan almost overthrew the planet once...  and now I'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through. what're we going to do? I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham! I do not like them, Sam-I-am! Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!! Thanks, Billy. There has to be something we can do. Come on, guys, think! Zordon's going to have my orbicular spheroids when he hears out about this! This is an emergency reserve of morphonic emissions.  It should be enough to get -you there. There is one problem.  I only have enough reserve to send you Phaedos...  I can't bring you back. So how do we get back? ... You'll have to pray that the legends are true. You're sure you want to do this?! The Rangers share purposeful looks. It's our only hope. Safe journey, Rangers! BE CAREFUL!! Ay, yi, yi, yi.  They're DOOMED!! According to the TX Tracker, they're headed for Phaedos. I'm gonna fire that slimeball so fast his not gonna know what hit him! Hi, honey, I'm home ! How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me! Sorry, slick, there's been a slight'change of plans. The "booger man" is taking over. Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives! Ooooh, that tickles! My turn. Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs. We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place. Ah yes, the RANGERS!!! SHUT YOUR BEAKS !! Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, find the Power Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART! Mordant, go with them and report back to me! Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens! Everybody okay? Ay, yi, yi, yi!  The filamentary transistors have malfunctioned! Why you low-frequency, battery operated -- WHOAAAAAAHHHH!!! I think so. This puddle thing is really getting on my nerves. ... Incredible... Let's see if we can find this Master warrior. Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer. You want me to place a few calls? No need.   I'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove. No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting. Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?! But boss, what about their parents? Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire. I understand you're looking for a few new assistants. Well put your mind to rest `cause now you've got the best. What is this?!  I advertised for brilliant and good looking assistants! Hi, I'm brilliant. And I'm good looking. And I'm Little-Bo-Peep. Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over? A stellar idea, Skull. Not so fast, greaseballs. You'll have to do. Hey. You okay? It's the best thing that's ever happened to all of us. ... He's gonna make it, guys. We'll get this warrior...  save Zordon...  and send that SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the SEWER he crawled out of. TAKE COVER! WE NEED OUR POWERS!! HANG ON, KIMBERLY. You're trespassing. Now state your business. We're looking for the Master Warrior.  Do you know where we can find him? The Master Warrior doesn't entertain visitors  - Zordon? Huh ... Oh, uh, we re, ah... Boys and girls, girls and boys, gather round and feast your eyes. This ain't sludge and this ain't guck... this is the one and only Ivan's Ooze!  Yesireebob.  It's ooey, gooey and even kind of chewy.  But best of all it's Here you go!  No pushing! There's enough for everybody! So where'd this guy come from? Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information. If we told you -- we'd have to kill you. INCOMING! Come on, come all -- it's an COZE ... Not bad. Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time. Where did it originate? And how do we do that? Look, Zordon doesn't have much longer to live.  And for all we know, Angel Grove could already be under attack.  We don't have TIME for this. ... Not bad. I see... an Ape. I see... a fox That's gotta be a frog. It's... an eagle? ... A falcon? Dad... ??! DAD?! You seen my parents? I can't find my dad either. What's going on?! Ooze, ooze, ooze rules!! That guy was the student body President Who is this lady? Here goes! Show off. You can do this.  You can do this.  You can do this... ... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers... I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen. ... We must try to communicate with them. Perhaps if I could locate a vertical-deflector then I could assemble a holographic-comlink. Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi . I can hardly walk... Do you guys really think we can pull this off? Maybe if we had more time. ... I wonder... We've been relying on our Morphin Powers for so long... maybe we've forgotten how to rely on ourselves. We should get some rest. Ladies and gentlemen, Simon says...  STOP! Simon says... stand on one foot! Simon says... Quack like a'duck! It just slipped out. SHUT UP!! You didn't say "Simon says". Simon says SHUT UP!!! This is the Iast time I use parents for anything! Let's pick it up here!  I've got a schedule to keep.  In twenty four hours the ooze is gonna hit the fan! Hey, boss! How did you fare? So they've been destroyed? What do you mean "basically"? Did these sticks make a whistling sound? Dulcea! That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!! How could you let them get away?! If Dulcea leads them to the Great Power, everything will be ruined! They must be OBLITERATED! I call upon the Powers of Darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold! And now the coup de grace, to lead my tribe to victorious battle! Queen Tengu, lead-your warriors to Phaedos, FEAST YOURSELVES UPON How the heck?!... What's going on?! OOZE!  OOZE!  OOZE!  OOZE! Thank you!  Please!  You're too kind. Finally. a little appreciation where it's deserved. We love you Ivan! Right back at ya!- Now, WHO MISSES SCHOOL?! NOT US! AND WHO MISSES RULES?! NOT US! AND WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME IN Can I have a word with you guys? What's really going on here?! Where are everybody's parents? Like we said before, that's classified, top secret... Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a load of garbage all over them. Well, why didn't you say so?! They're at the World Center Construction Site. Uh.   OOZE RULES! OOZE  RULES ! Dulcea... how do you and Zordon know each other? So...  what happened? How about Major Moron? How about the two of you shut Up and pay attention!! Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric Dad...?! We have to get out of here! Dig... dig... dig... Dad?!... It's me, Fred! Dig... dig... dig... Did I say anything? By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates. ... I just pray we're not too late. Let's give it a whirl. Angel Grove Police have been fielding hundreds of calls from concerned citizens as the number of missing gersons continues to grow Hi, folks, Ivan Ooze here.
