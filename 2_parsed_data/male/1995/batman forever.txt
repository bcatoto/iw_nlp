All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested. What now sir? Enigma. Mystery. Of course. 13 is M....MRE. Recognition, of course. But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean? Master, Bruce? No demons, son. Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them. What? Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man. What? Perhaps the fall... Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed. Old habits die hard. Are you alright? How are you feeling, young man? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady? Dr. Meridian... Why, indeed? Which `they' might that be, sir? I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time. _No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_! Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car. Actually, he took the car. I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling. Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick. No. You said I. I killed them. What did you say? Ninety-three, including the sauna. I don't know, sir. Your dear parents. Suddenly gone. So much loss... Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears. Apology hastily retracted. If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize-- Scholarly research? I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile. A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time. Hardly a worry, sir. ...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment? It's a wonder you sleep at all. The dreams again, sir? Just checking, young sir. Master Wayne's dead wives. May I help you, Master Grayson? Al? Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.Help Chase. I'll be back. I haven't had much luck with women... You are direct, aren't you? I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic. We all wear masks. Try a fireman. Less to take off. It's the car, right? Chicks love the car. Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor? What's wrong? Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian. Why's that? ...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work. And you are? Exactly! I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I? Wait. I have a riddle for you. Death. Death. Without taste, sound and all around us. Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap. No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.Tonight's a good night. Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase. Are all the Batsuits destroyed? Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma. And another name for Mystery? How about, MR. E. Letters in the alphabet. Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card. What do maniacs always want? All the answers are numbers. ...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman. I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me. Oh my God, Alfred. ...A bat. ...Afraid. There's one other thing. I feel.. I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne. But all this. It's like the life of a stranger. As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news. Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that. How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...? She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her. Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family... Why do I keep doing this? Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs. Maybe they're right. Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred. The _Rolls_? He boosted the Jag? Is that all? He ran away? Is he all right? Don't be ridiculous. He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents. It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them. Take any three you like. After you get settled we can... Gee, I'm not sure. Alfred? How many rooms? Total? I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me. In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong. They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear. ...The night Batman was born. What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember. Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me? I wonder if she'd go out with me. She has an excellent mind. It'll never work. How's the sonar coming, Alfred? Then you'd have nothing to complain about. I think they're getting worse. Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization. Banzai. Slanta. Nostrovia. What? Oh, it's very impressive. What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party- We'll talk some other - Call my secretary, she'll set something up. Factory looks great, folks. Keep up the good work. Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind? I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed. Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are? Mr...? Chase. There's something I need to tell you-- I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years. ...Not the bat? The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight. Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater... It was my fault. I killed them. I don't-. My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling... I don't want to remember! There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I... And the beast slouches towards Bethelem. Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman. Can I? So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman? Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me. Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain. I'm not- What? I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home. Why do I feel like the other man, here? They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather.... A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them.... The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles? Who's your decorator? U-Haul? I said I'm sure he did. He sure did. Fast work. You just moved here. But... Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along? Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep. Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis. That kid is amazing. What? This isn't normal? I'm sorry. Who are you? And into a black dress. But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes. Look, I'd love to keep chatting- No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch. Oops. Times up. To kill me. It's a stretch but I'll manage. Not much. So, this Riddler, he's dangerous? So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right? Wacko? That a technical term? Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes. Still play with dolls, Doctor? On occasion. Usually at night. Just ones this beautiful. Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion. Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us. Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me. All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse. And when you finally get Two-Face? Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know. We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school. How about Richard Grayson, college student? What the hell did you think you were doing? You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice. I want better for you. What I do isn't about revenge. Absolutely not. Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse. Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now. Excuse me.Four seconds from... Up here, Al. How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there? Big house. How many rooms? How ya doin', Al? Bruce, you can't. But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us. You can't-. I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own. ...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him! You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name? Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault. Back off, man. Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back. I need to be part of this. Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me. I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him. I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya. Okay. I'm outta here.I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle? Rinka. La'chiem. No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms. Skol. Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together. The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way... And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are... So glad you could come. No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you! Wait. You can't go. Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves! What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol. And some people have been trying to keep us apart. Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone. Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip. Bruce Wayne. In the flesh. Can't tell if you don't say please. Yesssssss. I know! How could I forget? Who is it? Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be. What do you think of my new invention? I don't think so. Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons. Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject. Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours. New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah. Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt. Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet. A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either. I'll show you it works. Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred? ...The Box can change their lives. Our stock coupons will spike. Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king. Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the... Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?Wait! You said you'd let me go! Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face. Please. I swear I won't say noth- I got family. ...Please. ...You gonna kill me?Oh please. You're blind as a bat. For _me_? Really? Tell me. Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now. Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks? You sunk my battleship. A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add. A-14. Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will! Go ahead. You can say it. Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours. Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you. About what? Not until you do that thing I like. On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie... Woah. Harsh toke. Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive. Here. Get a good seat. Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman? So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment. Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus? Yet so bright and chipper and conservative! It's so you. And yet so _you_! Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely. You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...Never heard of a double-cross? Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul? That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better? The coin _wants_ to decide. ...or death. What say we flip for it? Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject. _We_ sure are. A hit. B-12. Miss. We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad. You're a genius. Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy. Everything. Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right. Don't bogart that 'trode. Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again. Where are you sending Batboy this time? No. Wait... Holy shit. Let's see if you bleed green. A man with a death wish. Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list. How'd you find us?
