Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter? I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards. Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards. I don't know. Madison lives two blocks from their present location. There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you. If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself. Recognize this? How would you like your old job back? Whatever. We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android. My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate. On my life, I promise you I will. She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did. Don't worry, they have no idea where you are. Sid 6.7 is now armed. Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted. So were the first two cops to arrive on scene. Fine �� you want to stay here? This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use. She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick. If you can catch him. Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist. LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building. These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they? Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane. What about them? Don't give up, Parker. Not ever. Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first. New scar �� you making it okay in there? You were supposed to act as if everything was real. What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for? Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you. You may not believe this, Parker, You all right? Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach. Why didn't anybody tell me?! I think we both know who did. What's so urgent? You think he's smart? Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either. So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality? In other words, we collectively don't know shit. None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach. Any idea what Sid's going to do next? ... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty�four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in... I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.You already have staked your reputation. Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too. Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose. The fail-safe on�line, yet? He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards? I wish we could hear them. Why would they be going there? What are they doing in Los Feliz? But only you will know he's not human. Yes or no, Mr. Barnes? This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one. We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life. Catch him and your record's clean. You mean a nano�tech synthetic organism. Why wasn't I told? I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you. Not if you're with him every step of the way. That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby� trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter? You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field. We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re�assignment. Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell. This better not be a wild goose chase. You know how much man power you're talking about? Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where... Enough to level an entire city block. It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter. Did you find out where the bomb is? What did you find out? Barnes, where the hell have you been?! If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence. This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release. Think you can do it? Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do. I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive. Neither will the public. The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage. Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world. What the hell happened? Don't remind me. What did Cox pull him out early for?He hears...everything. I understand... I understand perfectly. I'M WHAT?! I'm still making adjustments... The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism. You need a maid. Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is. How do you kill it? This is supposed to be years away. It feels so.. .real. It's nano�technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules... Get that fucking thing away from me! Do I get to see it or not? Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours. If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR. He's developing a hemisphere imbalance. I wonder how that... How should I know? I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world. I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please! Help me get out of here. Of course you are. SID �� NO!!! I think I understand what you have in mind... All my work is my finest. What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here? My God... You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you? You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired! It was you, wasn't it? All they want to produce around here is mediocrity! Think hard -- it'll come to you... Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?Jesus Christ. I know who the dominant personality is. Lindenmeyer. I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else. You son-of�a�bitch, I'm going to kill you. It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying. In English, please. Can you tell us what's on the disc? If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself. When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head? Then I guess we're even. You son�of�a�bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How? Where's my gun? Their weapons missing? She wasn't part of the deal, Cox. What she's going to do is get in my way. Jesus Christ. Can you kill it? I've seen worse. It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee? You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games. Do me a favor �� keep sending them. You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year? But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days. I'm getting by. Real, my ass. It's an overblown game. Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho? He was a computer program for crissake. Why'd.. .you pull me out? Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today? You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to. Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates. Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena. If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel. No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target. How much C-4 is missing? Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards. Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been? How do you know I won't run? What happens if I can't catch him? Not from in here. Only because I got pulled out early. You won't want to watch. Turn around. Then shoot him already. How's your pulse? Where the hell are you going? Sid? Lindenmeyer? ...I think so...You? Because this pain�in�the�ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not. And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7. You don't know? You mean there's something you haven't asked me? A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where. Nice work. See something? Think he's keeping track of his creation? Part of him is. I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious. I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember? Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him. You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now? They're going to fry me for it, anyway. Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!! If you're gonna do it, better do it now. Both. Authority still makes me nervous. Real effective security... You like baseball? Start of what? What's the problem? Tell him. You know I am. Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it? Nothing. This is my area of expertise. Stop me. Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while? Relax. I know what you meant. Don't worry about it, all right? I forgot what real coffee tastes like... Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does. Welcome to police work. You better like coffee. Sounds to me like a well�educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next. What does that mean? You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. Where to? Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house? She's beautiful, you know? Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter? Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere. Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone. What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son�of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else. Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality? This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you. Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts. Hamlet. What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7? For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ. ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977. Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one... I've been in prison, remember? I'm surprised you didn't write one about me. Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him... You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think? What are you doing? Do me one favor �� if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it. What happened when he was 17? Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file? I know who would know. Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends. Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene. Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody. Fine. Never felt better in my life. See, I'm a good liar. Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it. Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive. Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie. I don't need a baby�sitter. I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that. Enough! Go to hell. Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more. If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence. You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it �� I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you. John died. A little less than yesterday. You actually listen to all those tapes? Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend? What are you talking about? Aren't you going to watch with me? You are going after Mayor Bennett. I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it? You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?! Where did you plant the C-4?! What C-4...was Cox talking about? Where did you plant the C-4?! What C-4...was Cox talking about? Why's that? DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD! You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!! You and me have nothing in common. The only thing I want to hear is your silence. Where's John?What I need is a nymphomaniac. I know. I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you... ... and you get nano�death. Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones. Separate the character module from the neural net... As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away. It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs... It's a physiological machine. Coordinated by polymer neural net. Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea. You're...such a wimp. Bastard... Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. I haven't been working on anything. HEY!!! At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about? Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow. As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever... You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived. What do you think I'm doing? Glad to... How can I ever thank�you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl? I am beautiful, aren't I? What do you expect me to do, thank him? You catching my drift? She's some of your finest work, Daryl. I had something a little different in mind. Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours? Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you? In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away. I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive. It was me, what? True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime. Should I have? Don't be angry with me, Daryl. BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD! I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now. Beam me up, Scotty! Thank-you, Daryl. You had me going for quite a while there, sport. I've got some final preparations to take care of�� Checking his watch, he stops suddenly. Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his Re�Election Rally... There you go �� best seat in the house. It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale. My...secret. Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night. Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night. I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you�� You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me. I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to? Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends. Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands? I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison. You know, we have so much in common �� we have such history together ��I've been thinking we should become friends. The symphony of collision... Performing solo. Enjoying the concert so far?It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform. I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene. I was assured the problem was corrected. Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real. Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember? As a matter of fact, I do. How does he know who I am? You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood? You've had a year�and�a�half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer. ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired. Of the six prison inmates you've tested �� all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -� only Mr. Barnes is still breathing. You embarrassed me in front of the highest�ranking law enforcement official in the country. Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me? Do they have to look so...robotic? As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you. ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month. To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
