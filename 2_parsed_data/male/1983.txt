Yes. In the Arctic ice. Lyssa ... Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress. Take the western passage. You have the power. Will it . Will your power outward. You must move away from the Center. I love you, Lyssa, I love you ... I will find you. I will be with you. Where is the Fortress? Lyssa ... Lyssa. Where are they keeping you? Have they harmed you? Lyssa ... Lyssa ... I can't wait either. I lied. Thank you, but I can wait. Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush. Never mind my ears! Go away! We're not married yet . What ? If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it. Well, you're beautiful. That's worse. Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin. Oh. That. I know what you mean. I had nightmares all week. I don't have to go through with it either. I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa. I won't leave you here. They have Lyssa! It was a platonic kiss, Father. I forbid you! No! You cannot know that! You're coming with us. What use is my sword? I can't reach her! She can see the Beast! She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it! Where the spiral begins. Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them. The Beast will kill her. Let us wish him peace. You will tell me her name and we will go together. I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man! Traitor! She'll marry you in hell! Then we must reach her before she feels that pain. Never. Can she be forced? Lyssa? Why ? Yes. No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress. But you suspect. Why ? The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here? I cannot reach her. I will find her! She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her. She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is. Darkness. Tunnels and corridors. Wait. I can't reach her. They know when they're going to die? Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons. Nor will I, till my bride is beside me. Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us. Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us. The Fortress moves? She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible? Lyssa ... Lyssa ... There is nothing. You won't have to. You have rope? But there is another entrance to this place. Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands? In the old books. It's called a glaive. I have no extraordinary powers. We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me. The new Queen lives. The White Castle has fallen. Each to his fate. It is today? Saddles. You have done it? What will happen? Slayers! How did you know? I cannot. I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her. I cannot betray my bride. I cannot take comfort when she has none. I ache with it. Yes. Yes. Yes. I don't think that. I know the cruelty of such a fate. You and I will guard the fire. Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying. I have need of friends. I was hoping I might be your friend. He saved our lives. What business? Perhaps he expected to eat it. A forest near the Valley of Needles. I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep. There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for. Make for the wall. I'll catch up. I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord. Subject to the King, no doubt. At the gallop! We could reach it on fire-mares. Go. I command you. The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it. Go, join them. Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things. Hand over your dinner. These we'll pay for. We must try to get horses. I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you. Forgive me. It's childish to cry. No. I'm not hungry. Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain. I'm all right. That I promise you. To the place where Death lives. So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons. You will follow me. I know you. Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for. Fame is what you leave to your sons. Fame. I don't think you'll grow careless.Each to his fate. Yes. It is today. I road them often in my youth. They can be saddled. Do not let the waters touch you. We must enter the swamp. I found the body of the Seer in the stream. And mine goes with you. I cannot go with you, my friend. A small house. No. We'll meet you at the inn. The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it. I am Quell. Me. May I eat with you tonight? Would you settle for a boar?What else is left for a man without friends. Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you. What ? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues. No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men. My friend . Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ... Once is enough, thank you. Staying alive. I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction. For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now. Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect? It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death. Where is this place? Help! Help! I'm drowning! My heart stays here. Quell? And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination. A venison pie as big as a house. Can't I come, too? Where are you going? I'm glad. I'm very glad. What is that awful looking place? Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life. I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera. You! A boar ? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar. Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals. No, no. I'm with you, boy. Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so ugly . And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh? Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ... What? Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air? Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything. What? Now you poke me in the nose as well? First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend. A foolish wish. And you, Quell? One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred? If I could wish ... ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ... ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house. Smart lad. Bring me my spices! I am Ergo the Magnificent ... ... short in stature ... ... tall in power ... ... narrow of purpose ... ... wide of vision. You do? What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy. Sugarballs? Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops? No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little. Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin. Let me climb to the top and sing to it. Look at its beauty. Look at its grace. Hush! The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent. Oh, my poor stew! I am being exploited! Where are you going? Food for crows. And do you think I live on air? What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves! I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers. Put me down, you lout! Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs! They'll trample him to death! Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ... ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it. And who is he that they should join him ? He was aiming a huge spear right at me! One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me. Me ? Travel with you ? I am Ergo the Magnificent ... ... short in stature ... ... tall in power ... ... narrow of purpose ... ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye! My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!Modred! Impossible! Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back. I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in. You were lucky. I lost thirty there. You were attacked in the forest?They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle. Can you see? I will seek the Fortress for you. Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then. With an old voice? Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing. Perhaps. If the pay is good. A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories. Naturally. You're resourceful, my lad. I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves. We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise. Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men. Yes, my lord. Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I? What kind of friend do you think I am? They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain. A flicker of talent. Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination. Yes. It will double our range. I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap. You've eaten nothing. Well, I'm not impressed. Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves. Not sleepy, either? They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them. When did you last sleep, boy? I compel no man to follow me on this journey. It should be an interesting journey, then. And where do you lead, boy? And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you. They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes. Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all. Hah! You don't know me, boy. How did you know I had sons? Fame? Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun. Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us? Look at its insides. I can't hold the weight of both of you! Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence. Passable, pimple, very passable. Oh, my poor stomach. I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you. Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison. We have plenty of hares. Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food. You had better manners as a pig. But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy. That is true. Kegan! Look. I'll stay behind and keep them busy. It's a hundred leagues from here. Each to his fate, lad. Fewer will survive them. Her name is Death. She has the power to kill. That creature helps no one. And none who go there return. The Widow of the Web? The leader of the Dark Ones? No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us. We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake. There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here. We'll find her. Knowledge I wouldn't want.You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command! You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa. You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one. You will go alone. You can't reach her! Through the door. Quickly! Of course it was. You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three. A fine match. A girl of some spirit, your daughter. That I am, my lady. I knew. It is important to assure the succession. Modred has treated with the Dark Ones. We will hold. Their power is not unlimited. The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers. It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered. Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen. He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner. We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win. How many did you lose? Yes. We lost five.He will not come. You will be my queen. Then he will die! These walls do not lie! He will betray you. Then look! You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.I can. Because I choose it. It is my fate to die in the Fortress. You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now. Cut. Cut ! Use your sword. I chose the wrong passage. The spiral begins in the west. She must make a glaive. Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her. They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ... He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful. You must never know her name. If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance. From here, I must go alone. He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious. He thinks you betray him with Lyssa. Colwyn! The waters deceive you! Yes. You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting. No. She must agree of her own free will. Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen. He has come for Lyssa. There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time. You will know, in good time. I'm not sure. No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks. She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast. The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all. Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below. What do you see? Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death. You choose these? You have not slept in two days. No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us. Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice. It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs. You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer? Reach out farther. Call to her. I am too old to climb down a rope. But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down. There is no other way. With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here. Your powers are greater than you know. Have you ever seen one of these? This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours. I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come. Turold's son was to marry her. Does the Queen live? No. He will master the leader. He is the King. He didn't join them. They joined him. If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death. The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill. The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us. The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power. Yes. It is the Western Ocean. It is the time. You know the voice. The new King. We seek the Fortress of Krull. Go now. Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends. It is too late. He has drunk. Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much. It is not necessary. They will not follow. We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn. Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me. Few have survived it. She had another name once. Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name. She has the power of vision. Yes. I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help. Yes. Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved. Many have perished in that maze. We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision. No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen. You will come with me. I cannot stop the sand. Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here. A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you. Could I lie to you and still see your beauty? There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa. The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here? Knowledge. Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see. You see? It is no trickery. Where is he? My son. You said nothing. You told me nothing. We had no children. No, she was not as beautiful. Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed. The most beautiful woman in the world. It is fifty years since I spoke it to you. Ynyr!Don't feel bad. It hasn't adjusted. No, I'm fine, thanks. I'm only walking him. You caught him. You have to be exhausted. We're ready for you.And Philip will be there to film it. Now that's the end of it! He's going with you, Doctor. Absolutely. Good idea. It would make a marvelous attraction; the only Great White in captivity. Go on, Doctor. What's your plan, Brody? What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon. I know, but you're just going to have to find another way. So you better start. Can't help you, Mike. Don't have the manpower. Have you checked the bars? The guy's irresponsible; he's done this before.Yeah. Down there. Coming with us? Overman's buying. You buying?Me? I don't know. Twenty, thirty. I love them, think they're the greatest. Never know down there. Helps to have a friend, sometimes. Well, don't worry about your fiancee. We'll watch over her. Aren't you suiting up, mate?It's disappeared. That? What?It's easy. Put a net on the derrick. Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up. And a missing man. We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon. I'll need more men to look. I don't understand. Overman's too good a diver to disappear. How many sharks have you killed? She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you. No. I'm fine. Only to myself. I want that shark, Kathryn. It's a construction job. I'm the only one that can do it. I am. You're not. Me. That's right. ... Okay. Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right. Come on! It's all controlled from the Control Room. You wanted to know about a cave? What did you just say before? About water flowing through them? I don't understand. Thirty feet??? What do you mean, we don't? What's the big deal? A shark got Overman, and we got the shark. So? Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will -- I can't! My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it. I can't stand it! I can't take water, Kathryn. I have to get out of here. Hydrophobia... Well, that's why you got it. So tell Calvin. ... He ought to put him in here. I don't want to see them, Kathryn. I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade. No, I'm not going through there. ... Mean through the tubes? Sure. Let's go. Okay. What's up? You don't. Me, too. How's your patient? Sean, that's right... You want me to stay? We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water. After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away. Just the two of us. No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me. I can use a shot of what he's got. You amaze me. I'm more scared than you. Change your mind? Why? 'Cause they're hungrier? Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime? Kathryn... Should protect you a little, from the compression. If that thing gets ahold of you. Bracelets. Here. Oh, yeah. Really nice. Who's your designer? Sassoon Shark? Kathryn, you're crazy. Really crazy. A suicidal maniac. After what happened to us? You're going down there again? It's never over... Here comes another six years of bad dreams. God, they're horrible. I hate them. Did you see its eyes? How black they are? The look in them? It's all right, baby. We're safe... I think so. I'm not sure... Are you? You would, wouldn't you? I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care. No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming! You'd think you're gonna leave me? I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber. What mind? If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this. And leave me down here??? Where are you going? Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle. Swim where? Out there? Oh, no, forget it, not me! You go, I'm staying. You sound like Houston Mission Control. What the hell does it mean? ... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here? What's wrong? Let's not talk about that now, okay? Oh, yeah. Very. I know, I built it. I've just never seen it this way. Let's head to the gate and work our way back. ... Friggin' fish. Baby goddamn scared me to death! Damn it! Yes. No. That's cute, Kathryn. Real cute. What do I do now? I don't have a choice. Where's the rubber band? They're coming with us? Not enough loving. Sure. Want to try that new Italian place? Okay, forget him now. I'm going to pick up Sean. Take a ride? It's his work. Yeah, you really don't like him. And what else is bothering you? How come? You called, Doctor? Honey, I gotta go. Don't let him get you. Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around. Yeah. Damn it. I can't understand! I gotta go, hon. Pre-opening jitters. Look, Kathryn. They're jealous. Hope I make it through both. What is it, 97 days? Want another one? Better than catching Sean's herpes. How you doing, Kelly? Sean. Sean, where are you? Thanks. Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while? Show him around for me? He's missing. Sure. He's big, Hutton. You never saw anything so big. Watch yourself. I'm sure you won't. But you're going to have to wait till we come up. Then you can film all you want. No way. After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it? Five hundred yards. It's large enough... That's impossible. If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh? Tell me that. It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool. I'll remember that, my Lordship. Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it? How come you're so brave with all this stuff? Oh... Polar bears in Georgia??? What the hell's there? So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia? Yeah? Well, in that case, have a drink. Buzz off. Hey, I don't want to hear. Yeah, poor bastard. Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it? Why don't you throw in another shark? You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen. Make sure you put this back. Yeah, well I didn't! Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane? Hey. All right, hit those lights too. Let us know as soon as you have anything. Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it. That's impossible. What kind of trouble? Yeah, right. That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara -- Sure. She still talking to you? It's all up to Kathryn. Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her. Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas. In one of those chapels. He can meet us there. This company's expanding. They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California. I think I'm gonna be going to Waco. It's not that easy. Worked construction every summer to get through school. Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this. Finish school first, Sean. Then make up your mind. If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time. Okay, you two, have a good life without me. I gotta go. You know Overman? Come on, let's go. Just find your own. Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea. Gee, it's good to see you! He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean? We were lucky to grow up the way we did. That's Dad... Big bust! He confiscate their water pistols? How is he? Still fighting crime? He needs a haircut. Hey, I'm proud of you, kid. How'd you do in school? In a restaurant. You sit there and they swim around you. Yeah, we'll find something for you. Shoveling shark shit or something. Look great, don't I? Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!We see him, Mike. Between the stadium and the ski show island. Right, Mike. I know. But we show it's not closing. It's not closing, Mike.Shit. You see the three-quarter socket? Sure am. It's Miller time!A piece of pie on Sunday. He. She. Let's blow the bitch up! We can assume he's back in the water intake passage. He's big as a bloody bus! I've heard of a White that big, in Australia... Is there such a place? A cave or something with such a flow? Well, Doctor. You've got your shark. Believe me, I am. Hello. I think his nap's over. And here I thought I was charming you. The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey. He knows I have it, so he watches out. Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos... That's because I am the shark. Philip. That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else. Some miss all their shots. You were quite daring in capturing him. Very skillful indeed. And I like you. I like it when they wake up. Not at all. Could be a new dance... Walking the Shark. Just watch it when he does. Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog. How's sleeping beauty? Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise! I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves! Don't be so concerned about them. Worry about yourself. Afraid I can't do that. Why? Let's hope he knows that. Lunch for Whitey. Something to munch on in case things get dicey. Shark bait. Draws them over for closeups. So do I, love. Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America" Well, then I'm going to film it. A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack. You know how many are born? Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers! Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known. It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes. Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard. You can get killed! That's preposterous! That's a load of codswopple. A Great White doesn't fear man. It doesn't fear beast. It's an orgy of food and blood. Unhappy combination. Most likely one's inside the other. Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it. Maybe you'll get it one of these years. Pack up, boys. Flipper's a flop. Well, I have to get this into the networks. If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all. No, no. That won't do. I thought they were clever. Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here? Okay now. Have Flipper flip or something. Yes, aren't we all. Fine. Have them do some. I just did. Can you make them do tricks? On the telly. We're to film him for the evening news. Always do. I'll stay out of your way. I won't interfere. I'll go with you. You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm. You have a man near it? How far away is filter number four? Filter system number four. Is it large enough? Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate. Reach for the limit I always say. Tradition. Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries. Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard. What I was born to do. The world's southern most reaches. South Georgia, Antarctica. Polar bears. No, South Georgia. Thanks. Bullshot. I will, old boy, tomorrow. Our work is done here. Just came to say goodbye, and good luck. That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely. Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw. I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year. A Great White chopped him in half with one bite. Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back. Watch it, Brody. You're ruining the shot. Precisely. Aww, can't I keep it? Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy. I say, love, is Flipper ready to go? Calvin said it was all right. Bring the crane over. Come down. Easy down. Absolutely. The audience will stain their drawers. I did. She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that. Give me a 400-foot magazine; we may be down there for a while. We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.Take it up! Take it up. Let's go, let's go! No... It can't be. Now what's this do? Can hardly wait to do it again. I'm not acting! I don't want to go in it, okay? No, think of something else. Not for me. I don't go in the water, remember? No, Kelly, I don't want to... The one that goes underwater? I don't know, what else is there? No. Of course not. Don't listen to him. He's - he's... ... my brother. Why you sonuvabitch... As always. You were great out there! This is where to be. High and dry. Well, I needed a cold shower. Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't. I can't even drink it. That's too bad. I don't like water. I don't like being around in. I never go in it. Are you really? Depends on big brother. I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great. I don't know, it depends. ... Massachussettans aren't. Massachussettans aren't. Yeah, from Boston. Puppy love. This time it's real! We can have a double wedding. No, really. I've never met anyone like her before. This is it. We're in love. Yeah, he'll really go for that. Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding. Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity? You and Kathryn gonna stay here? Mike, this is fantastic. I mean, you're responsible for building all this. What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together. Boat building. Don't hurry back. Something wrong? I want to see Kathryn. Who's grown up? Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins. Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring. Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games. Yeah, right. Took it this morning. So was Dad. Great. I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes. ... I'll go to McDonalds. Sharks??? Got a job for me? Damn! You sonuvabitch! Look at you!Back, Kelly. Lean back! Don't you dare. Now what? Balance, Kelly. Bal-lance! I am serious. Remember, skiers stay up longer. I thought I was your boyfriend. What're you doing later? The space shuttle has landed!Aha. James giving some woman the old heave-ho. Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions. I can't talk about it. She's fine. Well, actually we've broken up. It's all over. I'm not sure I can face it. Not too bad, thanks. How have you been?Congratulations. Who with? Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary? Who was the old one anyway? Attributed? I see. Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.It's everything we wanted. A very good read. A terrific piece of work. So, here's to you and Suez. James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are. Congratulations, and I really mean it. You know the lingo. Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership. Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages. Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why. Your readership will be first and second year American collage students... And you'll join me in a sambucca? Are you going to have coffee? Good. Yes...You're not a socialist then? And some of that. Sorry. I'll have some of that. Would you like a dessert...I'm having one. I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team. What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees... I know, I know! Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War. James Penfield. He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'. One of the best chapters in the book.What went wrong? Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation? Yes. Well, we were just... I will, thanks. Thank you. Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance. Yes. Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends. You're kind to be so encouraging. So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty. Thanks. History books are first onto the bonfires. To Ann. Please do. I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was. It's fine, thank you. Yes. Well, I am a great admirer of your work. I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school. I'm a journalist, not a historian. There are questions of method, and approach. I wondered-- What a shame. He was delightful. It's kind of you to see me. I'll suggest it. Remember though, we're news, not features. It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police. Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks. Terrific. Very good. But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent. Penfield. James Penfield. Thank you. Exactly that. No. That's terrible, Charles. What happened? How's Mary? Keep me company. Working hard on that book I was telling you about. Coming to the meeting? Charles! I didn't know you were back. Have a good holiday? And to history. Thank you. Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down. I think that's wrong. A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back. And the Americans were good allies. Simple as that. Freshman and sophomores... Thank you. Yes, please. I'd want to set out events as they happened. The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal. It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do. Then there's the essential-- No. I'd want to-- ...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez... ...break away completely from-- No thanks. I'd like to break away-- Hello. We don't seem to get much time to talk. Shall we have a drink or something? Why not. That'll be fun What did he want? Might? Might? Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow? He's all right, the professor. I haven't seen much of you. I haven't really thought about it. No. We talked about history, and Siberian Geese. I think she liked me. I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend. In radio we're different. You don't trust me. Too late. Just my luck. Me too. Why not stay? Again? Very thoughtful. Who? Both dead. How nice. Oh yes? No, there's a fourth. Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way. Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting. You're at the centre of the world. As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it. And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting. Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off. Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office. There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism. You're a processor of semi-official news. Some people leave at this stage. Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure. You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length. Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do. Professionalism. Too bad. What did your father do? You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian. Really? I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good. Oh, but he was terrific. I couldn't bear for it to end. I thought it was tremendous. What did you think of that Wadja film? Can I give you a lift? Thank you. We met last week, at the Wajda film. You won't remember. We didn't actually speak. That's her. You're a piece of shit My God. You even cooked up that Norfolk trip. Fuck off. Are you up to something? Yes, finally. I'm not sure. I'll ring you. Perhaps I will, then. Will it be fun? Sorry. Got held up. What are you doing here? Hold those rights. The torture of small children-- What have you been up to? We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake. You've really got it all worked out, haven't you? Ha ha... You're so gross. Mmm... Let me see. Oh yes. Jeremy, just let me see what you've got. Let me see. It's shit. Come on. Hand over. The Argies. To the Fleet. Bastard. C'mon. I don't want any Jones about this. Blas� and epicene. Nonsense. Not yet you know any of these people? To the airlift. Not here. What about the Cromwells? All right. Suez. 1956. Not at all. History. Oh, I see. Okay, I will. Thanks. I'm waiting for your mother. Hello. Next time tell her I've gone away. I'm not here. Terrific. Not bad. Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster. Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging. What is it? I'll ring you in the next couple of days. I've got to be going. I've got a meeting tonight. No, thanks Dad. Yes, you said. That's good. I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad. It was just impossible to get away. So how is she? Dad. Now listen... She said that? U-huh. I dunno. Ploughman's Lunch. Yes. No.A glamorous young lady way above his station... It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news. He needs a poet's advice. Of course. Committed to memory. Forever. It's terribly good. I've known Susan for more than fifteen years. James, we're old allies. It might have worked. Really. I would have been delighted for you if it had. But she wasn't interested. Not my fault. And you were obviously getting nowhere with her. I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that. Susan and I are very old friends, James. Big mistake, I think. You might have learned a lot. Six onion bajees! Great girl. Did you shake the mother off? Still in love? I'm off. Let's meet. You promised to tell me about Norfolk. Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton. Perhaps you should come too. Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained. Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in. One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police. The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man? On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights-- Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle. Purdy's come up with a real dog. Worker's rights in Argentina. So I've been running round getting people to do things. But no one's keen. Workers rights. When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights? I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--" Far too long. That's enough of that. No need to thank me, if you don't want to. Just pay for these drinks. According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often. You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend. She's very nice, apparently. Lives in Norfolk. And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there. It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal... She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot. Ah, ah. There's more. The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter. Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez. It was 1966, the tenth anniversary. ...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington. Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you. You're so hard. All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up. I expressed an interest... Get way. You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying-- You approve! Uh-huh. Tell me what you think of this first. Now, top secret file. And the Argies. To the Fleet. Name so Susie Barrington. Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist... No jokes. James is in love. We were just chortling over that. Blas� and epicene. It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today. One or two. A grey lot. Some social democrats. Some diligent anti-communists. A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA. Any sign of the goddess Barrington? To the airlift. Then one of them was sick all over your new dress. It's because he desires you. The women get all the breaks at these conferences. Promise. We'll see what we can do. You'd look naked without one. Voila! They won't let you in without one. Darling Susan. You look like an angel. But where's your hat? We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you. In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift. And you're so beautiful. What are you doing here? Darling Susan.No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea. Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years. And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London. I'm not telling you how to run your affairs. I'm just saying ... I don't mind. I'm giving you permission. You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife. Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive. In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs. A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was. Ploughman's Lunch. Traditional English fare. What would you call it? I'll tell you another thing. We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that. Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects. We've got the lot. Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films. That food you're eating. Well, it's worth seeing. I just might give you a ring when we get back to London. There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave? Have you ever watched a commercial being made?The bed's all made up if you want to stay. Or a beer. I've got some in. Now, are you going to have some more tea? And Joe Ramage - do you remember him? He comes and helps out in the shop. Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy. The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work. Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her. Tell her you made it. She'll like that. Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like. She keeps asking when you're coming... Come into the kitchen. I'm just making your mother's tea. Hello, Jimmy.I'm terribly sorry. He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back. It's that lady from Norfolk again. Fifteen news items. I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk. They're all old pros. Take a look at these.They don't count. It goes from Henry VIII. Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II. Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens? What period? Have you come to talk about me? She's not my mother, anyway. My mother's in Italy. Why not sit down and wait? She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. . Hello. No. Ah, Susy, it... 'Night. Don't close the door. Don't turn out the hall light.The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader! Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor. Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again! Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared. You cannot escape your destiny. I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. Yoda will always be with you.Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. I told you to remain on the command ship. It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.Who are you? Where am I? I can't see. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Hey! Yeah, sure. Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. I thought she was with you. Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here. I don't know. Fly casual. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? You got her warmed? Luke. Why don't you leave that crate and come with us? Oh... great! You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. That bad, huh? Where's Leia? How are we doing? Fine. Together again, huh? Luke! All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way. You love him, don't you? I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew. Here's the terminal. Charges! Come on, come on! Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. I'm sorry. Ahhh... What's going on? It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. It'll work. It'll work. Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand! Leia! You, too. Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. Well, look at you, a general, huh? Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando. It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. I'm trying! Lando, grab it! Lando! Let's see. Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. Come on! Come on! What did he say? Proper?! Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? What are you telling them? All right, hang on. On second thought, let's pass on that, huh? Good, I hate long waits.We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it! We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. All right. Stand by. Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Good luck. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! No, wait! I thought you were blind! Lower it! Han! Chewie? All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Here goes nothing. Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down. All wings report in.But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her. Leia! Leia's my sister. But I have no sister. Yoda spoke of another. I can't kill my own father. But I had to help my friends. I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it. I can't do it, Ben. There's still good in him. You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. Han, don't. It'll be all right. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. We got separated. Quietly, there might be more of them out there. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. Vader's on that ship. All set. Yeah, she's comin' up. Hi, Han... Chewie. I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend. Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. The same as always. Wouldn't miss it. Are you all right? Han! Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. No, you don't. You've always been strong. Then you know why I have to face him. Yes. It's you Leia. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. He's my father. Vader is here...now, on this moon. I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Tell me. What do you remember? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? I see them. Wait, Leia! Never-r-r! I will not fight you. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. I will not fight you, father. Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. Come with me. I know, father. Well, I'm sorry. Unfortunate that I know the truth? Yes. Yoda, I must know. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. Master Yoda, you can't die.Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Oh, Artoo, hurry! We're coming! I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god. Here we go again. In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge. Your Royal Highness. Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Disintegrated? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Oh. Well, yes. I am See-Threepio, human-cy...His lightsaber. They are clear, my Master. I have felt him, my Master. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, my Master. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? What is thy bidding, my Master? As you wish. Yes, my Master. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... You cannot hide forever, Luke. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. There is no conflict. Obi-Wan has taught you well. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. If that is your destiny. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. So, you have accepted the truth. The Emperor has been expecting you.Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. There it is! Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. I'm going in. Good shot, Red Two. Red Leader standing by.Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Told you, did he? Your father he is. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.Nope. Never. No, no, on the football field. They called me... ...The Smallville Flash. Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school? Brad. Aha! What'd I tell ya! Not enough vodka in it. S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing? Tuesday. Mr. Roebush? What are you talkin' about? What? Yeah? What do you want? The kid needs a man to show him -- For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent. A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport. All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here. Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row. Hiya, sweet thing. Little guy's getting' hassled, huh? Kent, you still here? Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could. "See" I mean, Hahaha! Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours. Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance. But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --The kid will do fine on his own. Give it your best shot, Ricky! I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids. Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way. Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad. I seem to be. Brad Wilson. But if you wouldn't mind settling for me -- No, well in this case I think I can speak for him. I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know. Superman will be there on Wednesday. Gee, I always loved porch swings. Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day. Uh-huh. Can I help? Call me. Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but -- Old ties are hard to cut. You know, I was just thinking, Lana -- -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis -- Me neither... Well, this pate is rather...unusual. No, thanks. I meant all the choices here. All this -- -- cole slaw, guacamole -- This is some picnic! There's a lot of choices here. Me?? Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream. Gee, I haven't done this in years. But all he had was chocolate milk. Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself. You thought that? Oh...I came close once. Who? But Lana, you could -- I didn't -- Too much mayonnaise? It sure is. The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and -- Sure, Lana, I'd love to. You're welcome...?? You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman -- ...uh, chairperson... You always did. Can I give you a hand with that? Lana Lang. How great to see you. I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run. Uh...excuse me, folks... Oh. You're going away. Let me do it for you, Mr. White. Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think? Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but --- Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem. Sure. We get together sometimes. What! Well... Not quite like this. Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary. You're the best, Lois. So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements? Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate -- Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ? What are you doing? At one o'clock in the morning? What's that? Mmmmm . . . It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible. Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are? Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . . The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint-- -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast! A television set? Not counting this week. You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . . Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks. Dishwasher? Any luck? What kind? Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman? Name?The boss wants to see you. Gus? Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise? Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'? How many sugars? They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where. No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could. They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got. Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent. There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number. That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65. First paycheck?Man, you don't never pass out, do ya? Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail! Brad? Brad is not a good name for a cocktail. Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name? What? What did you tell me? There's no vodka in it. Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong? TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!! Roebush! That's the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before... Omigod!! What's tomorrow? Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss. First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh? Buddy, are we in trouble. What about this week's check? Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum! I know, I'm the fault. Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet. Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs. They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it! Thirty-five. Nope, but -- Kitchen. . . Technician Yeah. Gus Gorman. Say who? Say what? Yeah. A raise . . Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here. One. And a half. So where is all them half-centses? Who gets it, the company? What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach? Everybody loses them fractions? I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool. First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80! Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax! Sonofagun! Look at this here! Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got -- Hey, what y'all doin' up there?! You want to mess with Superman? Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot. You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet. Yeah, sure. Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train... Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do? I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out! Stone mutha. I told you it wasn't no jive. Yeah? How's it look? Anything. Everything. I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer. Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it. A computer. Fair's fair. Don't be getting' racist with me, man. Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody. 'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans. Now...when do I get a taste? The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set. Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'! Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes. Then how's all the people gonna get their oil? They ain't got captains? Huh? He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of... Greed! Let me tell you something--- That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me. I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig. Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin' It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby. well. I know some stuff too, y'all. Uh...what channel were you watching? Turn on the T.V. Hey, boss. Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where." He says I'm a genius, your don -- Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba! See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into. First question got to be "Where." Yeah, yeah, I can do it. How do you do that? That what they call you? Me? How? But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing? Wipe 'em out? Columbia. Which country? Decaffeinated too? Man, what is this? Black or regular? I'm tryin' to. 'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses? Or socks. Yeah? What do you do with 'em? Uh... Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but... Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and... I was afraid you'd say that. Hey, is there a bus station around here? Whatcha wanna stop here for? Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand. We back in Metropolis? We gonna crash? Watch out for them air pockets! I ain't about to argue with you. What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies? Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on. I know, by computers. And do what? What she call you? Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'. Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story. Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay? Wow, what a beautiful sunrise! The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is -- But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right? I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school. It was hot! Why do I have to do this? A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures. The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker! What about me? I didn't have my camera with me. That's his sister. Vera Webster. Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.Kent! -- but you deserve the vacation, Lois. I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this. Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK Personally, I think it could be a terrific story! Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here. You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film. What about you? All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it. A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera -- You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!! Who's the other woman? Who is she? Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean? Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s. Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion. The picture looks blurry. Where's the handle? Why do I have to do this? Couldn't we just get a computer to do this? How'm I supposed to turn this thing? Okay? Goodbye. 53. Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---Hi. Mister Kent. Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman! Could you get me Superman's autograph? Mr. Kent, could I ask you something? Do you really know Superman? Mr. Kent! Superman was here! Mom and I do this all the time.Join the party, genius! Come on up! Can't wait, pal, can't wait. Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent. Can you do that? But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it. Exactly. Stoned mother. Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it. It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it. Tell me more... What will it get me? What will it do? You designed it? We've already got some. For what? A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans. Blueprints. What do you want? Is this whitemail? Is this blackmail? I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail? I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon! Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal? And then shut down the pipe lines. You catch on fast, old buddy. Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps. And do nothing. Just sit there. Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney. Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it. KRYPTONITE! Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed. God, that's what I keep you for. Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space. What are you talking about, fella? I did. isn't it neat-o? Just the man I wanted to see! What? When? Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you? So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal. Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells... Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons. Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan? A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail." And you are going to do it for me. Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean. Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. Columbia. But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me. You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you? Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon! Plants. Plants always make an office cozier. I don't think you understand. Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee! Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow? Yes! That never occurred to me. Her ya go, buddy, single-malt. Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect. I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers... Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice. Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from." You want to be rich, right? You've been a naughty boy haven't you? C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty. Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question... Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree? Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician? My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow. Missing???? It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said. He's coming! He's going to hurt me! He's the only one who can operate this -- Wait for Gus to get here, sis. That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All... And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business... Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all. Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving... So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage. We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite-- The planet Superman came from. Krypton. I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet. Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him. Nuts... Nice try, Butch, but it wouldn't be effective against Superman. You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to! He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it. I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea! We already have a super-tanker. TOMORROW THE OIL! You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!! Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small... Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist. Computers talk to other computers, right? Storms! Floods! But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more. Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands. Get a hold of yourself, Vera. Nobody else ever will.He's bound to slip up sooner or later. Hello. I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it. In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up." Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work! Embezzled, Mr. Webster. Stolen from the firm. 85,000 dollars.Suit yourself, Gus. Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation? Thanks. Let's go Just a second. No...I just have a little stop to make. I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing. No, we're just going down. That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore. Hey, you're perfectly safe. How you doing down there? The bridge...? I'd better get going! It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic: Hey, Don't I always get there in time? Come on, relax. There's no rush. You just did, with that great dinner. You know, I really wasn't expecting all this. I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry. See you around, pal. We've already met. Anytime. I'd wash that out with some iodine... Okay, Mercurochrome. That wasn't me. That guy's gone. And you're next Webster. I don't know you, lady. No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you? Okay, what is it? You want a ride? Tell me. I'm in no rush. So what do you have in mind? Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
