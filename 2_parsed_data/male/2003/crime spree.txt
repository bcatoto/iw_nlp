Yes I did. Lose ends are messy. I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life. Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes? When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook. Yes I did. Lose ends are messy. I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life. No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it? Remember? Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you. A pass. Where are the tapes? You're fucked, Sami. You know it. That's why you're here. No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place. Okay. Okay. I believe you. You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired. Yeah. I figured I'd be hearing from you. Agent Hadley. Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are. We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it. Too many people know about my involvement in this. What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs. Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back? I can't bring the Bureau into this. If I do the tapes become evidence. This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison. You'll never get out of the city. I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go? What? This? Where did they go? Not today. Where are your friends?I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano. To tell you that we're interested in the property. I'm not here to negotiate. I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills. Supernumerary. It means better than expected. Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the -- I'm good. Really. No thank you. Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards. Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony? What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take? They knew who you were when they broke in your house? Why didn't you tell me about this? But you were there? Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it? Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother? You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me. Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it? Good word. They're gonna be what? Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property. He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory. And? I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today. Frankie, come in. Good to see you. You want something? You have something for me? This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris. I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made. Where are you staying? I only have your word for that. And the other half? And for my help I would get what? You want me to help you get out of the country? I assume you want something? I don't think it will be a mystery much longer. You rob an associate of mine... a friend and-- Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes. Don't bullshit me, Laurant! I know about the Van Gogh. -- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock. It's Daniel. You don't trust me? What? C'mon, Laurant, America? Uh, yeah. Where's your brother? Thank you. How about if I call you? I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word. I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris. Half the tapes. We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home. He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years. I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery. Not such a good friend. May I reach in my pocket? I guess we're going to find out. What kind of business? For what? If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again. Tonight? Jesus! Raymond, grab the tapes. We're leaving! Why is everything an argument with you? Because you're the closest. Get that, will you? Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car. Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now. We're leaving. Raymond get the bag. We can't. Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one. You know what makes a good get away driver? Being able to get away! Cut his pants up the leg to the groin. Bring me the scissors. I'm going to kill him myself! Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead! Cops? He said to go fuck yourself. We'll see. I just want you there in case there's trouble. Hopefully no one. In English. Sami doesn't speak French. We'll think of something. We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card. Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us. Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires. I can't believe you didn't check. You didn't buy batteries? Turn on the flashlight. We still have to get out of here. I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi. We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house. What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel? You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better? Do I? You're sure? Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito? You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you. Everyone get some sleep. We're leaving in the morning. That moron. I think he's already figured that out. Besides, we don't know the city and-- I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes. You better. I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today. You haven't answered my question. If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing. Can I trust you, Sami? What'd you get? He's been shot a lot. He's used to it. Hello? Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond. No? Has to be. All you are is a professional ass-kisser. I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to. You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us. You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you? I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie. It's not? Good idea. Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door. This is Zero. There's just one more thing I need you to do. I'll tell you when it's time. There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do. Fine. Ten o'clock. We had a deal. -- Did you set it up? It's me. Fine. How much? Why haven't you turned us in? I'm from Belgium. I've got a way with people. Don't bullshit me. Guns. Can you get them? I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.Hard to say. He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car. -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car. I just thought that-- Maybe you should call the police.Good song though. But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss. Okay boss. You didn't say find them. You said, "get them." Okay boss. Where are they? Well, I must say you're handling it very well. Boy, you must be pissed. Everything? What'd they take? French guys? You mean like from France? Hey boss, it's not a science. You said don't do it, boss. Go look. What room number? What hotel? Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found? Are you forgetting who supplements your income? And the other car? What'd you guys find?That's an excellent plan. Very comforting. What for? I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list. I thought they came with batteries. Do they come with batteries? I'm trying. It doesn't work. Go where? The police are outside. What do we do? I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels. Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right. And he gave it to us. 145 Ridgeway Road. Bastaldi got the address from you, yes? What about transportation? I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem. Oh, then we will have the house wine. Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago. That's brilliant! Care to elaborate? Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I? I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city! This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is? I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself? This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war. I don't know. Maybe if we did just leave -- Okay. I will have a beer. What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine? I see. A master criminal. What is it you do, Sami? We both know I'm already dead. When we get to the next corner jump out. Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate. This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven. I've never driven a Cadillac before. I'll drive. Relax. It will be fine. Oh, man... this is bullshit! You can't trust anyone these days.Okay, we're square now, right? What? We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime. Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred. Hey you guys are becoming famous. I was just watching the news and-- Yeah? A thousand dollars? And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee. I ain't no rat. You got money, right? Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you. I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya? I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible? Man, I can get anything. What do you want now?Oui. Should I call you back? Oui. No. Oui. Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy. It's me... It's Elvis... Maybe if we gave the tapes back -- We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up. I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine. Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night. This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew. Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this. I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it. No. The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is. It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road. You think it's smart to tell him we're French? Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go! I was told to take what we have and go. There must be half a million dollars here though. There has to be. Oh yeah. The map said to go left. How about Canada? No. How much? How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick? What the hell is he talking about? Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd. Give it to me, Sami. Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine. The baseball is mine. God, I want to go home. Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself. Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings. Why would they want us to rob the Mafia? Mr. Taylor? C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do. -- I want to be Elvis. You lived there. You know the city. Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them. Today's your lucky day, Sami. Going somewhere?Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car? I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut? Hector, don't interrupt me. -- Don't think. Okay? You're not good at it. Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car. Fuck you, grease-ball! I'm telling you that's my car! And someone's gonna pay for it! No. It's mine. Anybody know about that car outside?Why do I have to pick up the tapes. I'm just setting my boundaries. I'm not any closer than you are. Why do I always have to answer the phone? Why not just steal another one? She probably hid it at her place. The six of us could find it in -- No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison. I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane. Yeah. We just go home. No problem. You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people. I'm not going to leave you. I knew I should have driven. This is the only American car you've ever driven. I'm the driver. I am not comfortable with this. I'm not a good liar. She took everything! Didn't even leave us cab fare. What are we going to do, take a taxi? I don't know. It's gotta be millions. I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly. There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism. A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther. The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow. It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment. You see that car? I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you. I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother. Mr. Zammito? I would like to thank you for your hospitality. If you are ever in Paris here is my number. How are we going to do that? Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No? Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France. No thank you. I am Raymond. Thank you for allowing us to stay here. Glenmorangie is very good. J&amp;B? The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine? He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth? Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us. It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us. The money isn't here. How do we know what room she's in? What? I think we went the wrong way. Watch this. Feel free to correct him if you want.You didn't have to kill Sophie. You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them. What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal? And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am. What about me? Aren't I a loose end? You didn't have to kill Sophie. You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them. They don't have a murder weapon? A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene. I can get them -- but what do I get if I do? Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted. Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you. You killed her! Wired? I ain't wired. What are you doing? If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue. Do you know who this is? So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother? Did you have to use that much explosive? I will. Does it really matter what I say? No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead. Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room? What? Some bread and... Anybody hungry? What's he joking around for? He's been shot. Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy. Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs. It's not your fault, Daniel. Hadley -- All right, knock it off. It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up? We have to find Sophie. They'll be waiting for us at the airport. No. Chicks dig me. What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something. How'd it go? I don't know. Daniel, how would you say it went? That's Frankie Zammito. The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia. I'll be Elvis and you-- We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here. After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window. Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five. It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here. We've got to get out of here. Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool. Yeah, but you did do it. So let's deal with that. No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family. C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money. This kind. They don't serve wine here. Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave. You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing. I'm Sami. Marcel sent me. No! No. No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball! This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball. Hey, you know you can't this in France. It's good. You guys used to work together? "Vase with twelve Sunflowers." No, that's not Mr. Taylor. We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe -- Do you know who that is? Okay. You can be Elvis. It's my idea. I've still got a few legal problems back in the States. Me? Yeah, I can see that. Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run. Glenmorangie. I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself. I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him. You're not helping. I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on. Where is it, Sophie? Wait here. Holy shit. Oh, you think? I'm glad you didn't get something flashy. He speaks about himself in the third person? He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi. I don't know. It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here. You wanna tell him? They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why? Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us. I can't even hear myself think. You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that? Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really -- Algeria. Why? Who are you waiting for? I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be. It's three in the morning. Not much else to do. I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe. It's not your fault. No. Who's gonna see it there? It's okay. It was a long time ago. No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy? I don't remember. I was drunk. You ask a lot of questions. Something like that. Something like that. So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed? Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's? No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight. You ever hear of jet lag? When do we go? Thanks.I don't know. I didn't look. The Holiday Hotel. A Wallet. A hotel room card. Some cash. No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this? Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this. Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.No shit? Yeah. How? I don't know what you're talking about. Uh huh. I'll get you the papers tomorrow. I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here. It's for you. A car. You gonna forget about the money I owe you? A little? Yeah. I'm going home today. What do you want, Frankie? You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'? She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs. Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother! Frankie, I --I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago. All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris. Jesus. What kind of FBI agent are you? Hey man, you can't do that! I dunno. They left about a half hour ago. Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something? Cool. I know where she went. Yeah, I dig him. No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one. And the Vodka. What about the money? You want Zero to kill him? We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks. We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass. And if there is, then Zero can kill someone? No one? Then why is Zero here? Where are you from? They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key. And how do we do that? We don't know that for sure. What does arresting us get them? How are we supposed to sleep with this noise? Zero did not put it in his bag. He put it in yours. -- Zero isn't interested in your life story. Who gets killed? And you don't speak French?
