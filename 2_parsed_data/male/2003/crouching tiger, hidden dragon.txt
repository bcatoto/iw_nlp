Well, Li Mu Bai can do it. She's crazy. You should have killed her. I'll go and make up his room! Much better. You've been gone so long. You're back!Then leave her to me. This Jade Fox is a woman? Why were you spying on the Yus? Wait! I'm a friend!And if I use them to kill you? Why do you want to teach me? Go ahead. On guard! Stop talking like a monk! Just fight! Do you think you are a real master? What's it to you? I do as I please.Let's go! I'm just playing around. What's it to you?Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you! If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me. I studied the diagrams. But you hid the details! Yes, you do! You are still my disciple. It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it? Wherever we want. We'll get rid of anyone in our way. Even your father. You're already a thief. They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword. Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun? You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me. You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat. Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule. You're home late... or should I say early?Are you related to Li Mu Bai? You don't seem to understand. In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance. Hello. What is your name?That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good. Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you. I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets. Why should I? You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness. Real sharpness comes without effort. Then tell me where Jade Fox is. Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword. All of it is simply a state of mind. Where's your master? Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword? Tell me, who is your master? My name is Li Mu Bai. The Green Destiny is mine. Jade Fox can't be your master. Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move? Who are you? Why is the Green Destiny in your possession? All right. Hurry. I will hold on as long as I can. Then you have no use for the sword. Kneel! What I've always wanted, to teach you. Let's end this here. Stop it! You don't deserve the Green Destiny. I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you. Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit. My life is departing. I've only one breath left. Shu Lien... My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master. There is no antidote. Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here? I'll look around and catch up later. We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in. You're right, but I don't know what to do. I want to be with you... just like this. It gives me a sense of peace. Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble. Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it. Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence. My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real. All right. I'll write you an introduction. Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me. She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself. We'll keep our eyes open. Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl. Just be patient with me, Shu Lien. I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues. For her, they might make an exception. If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon. That's not for her. She should come to Wudan and become a disciple. She needs direction... and training. You did your job well. But, this girl... I saw her last night. True. But I must borrow it for one last mission. Jade Fox must die at its edge. Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl? I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it. Well, we had talked... I don't know it was stolen until I got here. That's not what I meant. I don't care about the sword. But your men are watching over Yu's compund? Have you questioned him yet? It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's. Were you involved? Did you see who posted it? So I shall avenge my master's death after all. I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking! Jade Fox? Impossible. What have you discovered? Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu. Perhaps. First I must visit my master's grave. It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death. And yet I'm thinking of quitting. I must pray for his forgiveness. It's time for me to leave it behind. Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade. I am. He has always been our greatest protector. Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me. Something I can't let go of. You are leaving soon? No. I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment. Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow. I couldn't bear it. I broke off my meditation. I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back. During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared. I had come to a place my master had never told me about. I left the training early. Yes. Fine. It has. How's business?"A faithful heart makes wishes come true." Jen... I will. You must decide. You might get tired of this life. You might begin to miss your family. If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too. She would miss us. Jen... I want you to be mine forever. I will make my mark on the world. I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend. Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish. Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped. He didn't die. He wasn't even hurt. He floated away, far away, never to return. He knew his wish had come true. If you believe, it will happen. The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true." It is trouble for me. Your father's men are still looking for you. They're still out there, circling closer. I am a man. And now I've found the brightest star of all. Out here, you always fight for survival. You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance. Slowly, your gang becomes your family. All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier. When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars. I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan. I used to look for stars alone. I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them. I've been riding in the desert ever since. I don't take orders from anyone. I'm sorry... I guessed wrong. I though you were a Han. Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse. No more hitting on the head! All this trouble for a comb? Still in a bad mood? At least you're speaking. What's your name? You've got quite a temper. It's better this way. Well, there used to be! What's your name? I'm Lo. The Hans call me Dark Cloud. I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning. You're tired. You need rest. Your horse needs water. There's a creek up here. Let's stop a moment. With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here. I can't wait any longer. I was wrong to let you go. Come back with me. You'll be happy in the desert. You'll be free there. Jen!What do you have in mind? This is a delicate matter. Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai. Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this. When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots. Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him. I'll give him an earful! Don't be coy. I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time. Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something? Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying. Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter. All right. I'll act as the sword's custodian. This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon! He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it. It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
