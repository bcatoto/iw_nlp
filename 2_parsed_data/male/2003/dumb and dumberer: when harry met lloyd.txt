Yeah, I think. Yeah, we're closed. So go away. Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away. I have five kids at home, I know how it works. I'm just not "it". Okay guys? Two fifty. No, I'm not it.Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys. I'll tell you why! Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che. Sleeeeew sheek baw... Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww. Then I'm in. Just like Jerk-Off. But I came here to learn about America.Oh my god, are you alright? Actually we have something for you. You're it. Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else. Hey look, it's our teacher. Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins? Okay. I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal. Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window? Coming. Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants." Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay. Very good. Back in a jiff. Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom? I'm fine. She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened. That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class. Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? You had questions? Yeah, but I'm buying. Ooh gross. Gotcha. O'clock? Excuse me? We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special. Oh, you want to talk about your delicates? Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin. A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake. MS. HELLER said not to talk to you. Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip. Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica? Heddo Jeth-ica. HARRY Dunne. Four colors? Neato! Yeah. How'd you know? Depends how you define 'new'... In the new library there. Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes. Famous? I've never heard of it. No, I'm fine thanks. Well la de da. Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat! Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie! Is it okay if he spends the night? Mom, you know that never works. Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas! I know I am, Mom. You know Mom, like in the pool. Wow just like Marco Polo. Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure? I'm just not ready. Is it true what you said to Captain Rob? I know. Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal. Sorry, Charlie. No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it. Well, what should we do? She's one of a kind. What? The one on the left. Right. Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again. Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS! Well, that's too bad, this is his day. Hey there goes Principal Collins! Oh, good. There's Jessica. Start the tape, Lloyd. You're a great teacher, Lloyd. Oh my god. Can you believe your ears? Guys, this is much better. LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want. Wait, wait! Ready Lloyd? Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did. That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade! And like she said, do it before the parade. That's what Jessica was talking about! What? What did we do? Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend. What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again? That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this. Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes. Do you know what this means? I don't know who we are anymore. I... found that rock. I made the polar bear pants. But my mom gave me the map. You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship. Well, I'm listening now. You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me. Hey, look. Ice cream. Cute puppy. Hey, let's go spy on them. No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land? PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend! Hey, it's Jessica. It's okay. I want the rush. Are, too. You're it. I know I did. Yeah, that's why I asked. What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it". Who? A blimp. No. What happened? Me, me, me! You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends. Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what. Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink. Do you hear something, Captain Rob? Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"? Go away, assface. You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom. But- LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom. Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones. What are you staring at, you ugly monkey? Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face. I bet you want your head scratched. Do you want me to pet your head? Hey, where did you come from? You have beautiful eyes. Yes. Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes. She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her. I don't think so. I kinda screwed things up. Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here? Shut up! You can't marry my mom. Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to. Some what? I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means. Yea! Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now. Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment. Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up? Who's your partner? Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner. Wanna bet? How do you know it's for us? What? Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure. Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord. ...cause you said... LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed. There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear. Owww. My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today. I don't know. Owwww. Owww... refreshing. These are really cold, huh? Can he do that? You're it. Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again. Nice jugs. A. Slushee. Don't tell me. Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States. Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart? I didn't know that. ...and who was Benjamin Franklin again? What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun? No. HARRY. Collins is a great man! Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet. I learned it from listening to you! I hate you! Shut Up! Buttlick! You're not my real dad. Shut up! Will not. LLOYD, she's my mom. She did not. What? If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank. Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin. Yeah, go-cart accident. I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg... What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure... No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand... Just a guy I hang out with. Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob. Go fish. Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class. Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed. ...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells... We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking. One day they'll find a cure. The second R is silent. It'll be like taking candy from a stranger. Can we eat there tomorrow? Oh, is this your special place? Wow. Who's Principal Collins? God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly. Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great. Me too! Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear! No. Why not? Don't we want them to talk to us? What? My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school. No, it's a treasure map. I think it's just over there. I go to school where I live. Home school. Til today. Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid! Probably because we've never met. Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep. HARRY Dunne. That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket. We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub. The name's Walter. Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.What are you talking about? Can you believe it? I don't know if you'd call us "friends"... Duh. I'm in your class at school. Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?That's gross. Hey, where'd you go? You take her. Try one in a million! That's the one I wanted. Damn! What are the odds? Okay. Which one do you want? Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition? I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget. Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women. And with that complete loser He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention. How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea. Roger that, Wilco. Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English! PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be. HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not? Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started. HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington! A float! She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is. We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class. Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done. That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him. Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on. I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes. Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us. It was a diamond and you swallowed it. But I ate your Mom's pie. I lugged it all over town! How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it. Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape. Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen. You thinking what I'm thinking? He must be on his way to pee out a fire. He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope. Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night. That must be her boyfriend's car. No. Look. D2. Am not. Sorry, no further questions. You certainly did. If you have to ask, you don't know. Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward. Hello, he only invented money! George Washington! A turd. A raft. Nothing. Why, whaddya hear? By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon? The answer is George Jefferson. No one knows? HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny? Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one. Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language! Captain Rob came back? JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend. Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map! HARRY! I found the treasure! HARRY! HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible. So, have you given him "some" yet? Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey? Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face. I bet you want your head scratched. Hey, where did you come from? You have beautiful eyes. HARRY, can you hear me? Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say. You're always your harshest critic. I'm sure you're overreacting. Just wanted to see how your doing. Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate. It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision. Sure I do. On one condition. You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it. Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some". Who cares? Chicks are for fags. Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay? That's a cow, Harry. I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner. You and me? Dream on, desperado. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Sucks for you. Nope. I was right. Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool! Our own special bus. According to the map, we're just about at school. HARRY! Here he comes. HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'! Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!? What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband. And my mouph is frozen. Put some ice on it. Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww. Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY? That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me. HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong. Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go? You're it. They can't be real. And he invented fire. When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain. Now how about a slushee? Welcome to public school, my friend. The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla. Don't look directly at him. Okay. Anyone else have any questions? You look familiar. Did I have your brother? Now you see why he was elected principal? That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night. Kids. Where did you learn that word? You take that back! I will stop this car right now. Don't use that tone with me, young man. I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say. Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy. Your mom made a move on me. Whoa. What was that? A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it! Exactly! A pirate! Peg leg? Yeah, he's a pirate. Sounds like a pirate. I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge... Who's Captain Rob? Got any crazy eights? JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction. Now that's more of what we're looking for. HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English. CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong. And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity. You brave soldier. Oh, of course. H A R R Y... Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs. No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new. You know, you're the first person I've brought here. The principal. Shift to your left. Yeah, he's aces. Thanks, Turk! You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day. How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now. Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean? No no no no no. Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you. You're it. I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something. Cool. Is that what I think it is? Me too! Home school? What's that? I haven't seen you around here before. No, that's not it. Anyway - LLOYD Christmas. No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar? Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool! You could've saved that for the tooth fairy! Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion. "My dream date with Principal Collins." HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is. ... If I may quote the twentieth century poet - Joe Piscahpo: You look Marvelous... Looks like the best man won. Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer? This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone. That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it? Me too. I'm almost there. What are you doing? So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan. Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather? Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape. Oh, go on. Tomorrow night? Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that. Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school. I know, you want go for a ride. You know, "some". The fag stuff. Checking up on my friend, Harry. Do you want me to pet your head? Don't answer me. Say what I say. Why ith dat newth? If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late. Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in! So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob? You really are a pirate. Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right? Do I know you? You were born free and free you should remain. You can bring whatever you want, little friend. That's the downside. There is none. Of course it does. Obviously in denial. Maybe we can help. Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you? Uh-oh. Harry? Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go. Do we have a deal? Go in there and get us two slushees. It's too close to call. Okay next contest, now lets... Oh yeah, give it to me. Have you got what I want? Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up. Hey can be on top? I liked it a lot. Well he missed a great pot of stew! Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D? So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine. We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom! Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING! Thanks, Pop. Obviously. Or maybe crossing a river! Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching. Will that be on the midterm?Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league. Then where did you get this not my tape. Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape. I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica? Not to expect you tonight. One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear. Oh I think you do. Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest? You had some questions. No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse. Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore. I sold all the wind instruments. Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat? Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything. Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit. Okay, I'll take care of Jessica. JESSICA. Are you sure? No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking. I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen. Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years. The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence. The chest! The chest that I put my papers in. Just like the President. Everything. Just for the record. Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office. No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand. Well I've got a little surprise for you. What? Who's there? And you are great in bed. And, take some more pictures. So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow. Yes! I think you'll make a good teacher. Aloha means hello and goodbye. Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather. No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class. Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class. Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this. Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius. You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki. And I you. Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.I reckon so. My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different. What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed? LLOYD, may I see you a minute? Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it? You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.Fine. Give me the doll hairs. Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars. Okay. Sure.Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend? How much homework is there? What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks. Skateboard.CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent? I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate? ... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison. ... flying gracefully... over the rice fields. She's saying... a beautiful swan... Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it. You're just jealous. Special Needs class. TURK, leave him alone. You're coming too.But we don't drink from the house do we. Yes you are. Well you know Detective, he's expecting 'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well... Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap. I'm not sure if I can do this.
