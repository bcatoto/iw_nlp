You will be lonely. You will howl  like a dog as you walk alone. You  will carry dog shit cupped in your  hands. You will be smeared with dog  shit. Your spirit will wane and  dwindle to blue, the colour of  despair... ...This is your path. There is no  other. That's a curse you can use on  the Yankee before battle. And that works? You have to say it in Cherokee. You said it to me in Cherokee. So keep your head still. Anyway, there won't be any war. And  if there is, they say it won't last  a week. Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys  keep store hours. They ain't open  yet. That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him! I'm not firing, start the damn war  off. That's my rabbit! That was something! That's hell and  we've been there! Kicked old Nick's  asshole. You got a charge? I got a few. You saw? I saw. I know you don't recognise me. I'm  Mo Oakley's boy. It's okay. I was thirteen when you  all left. Am I going to die? I'd like to hear some music while I  go. Play me something sweet. Like a girl's  waiting for me. Play me something like there's nothing  to fear from a merciful Lord. You heard him. Like when you're thirsty up at  Bishop's Creek and the water is so  cool. I'm reaching Cold Mountain before  you. Don't get up, soldier. You are  mentioned tonight in my report. You  are a credit to the Highlands, to  North Carolina and to the Cause. Do you have news, sir, on my  application for transfer? I know. A bloody day. It's what our  General said: Good thing war is so  terrible else a man might end up  liking it too much. Sir. It was my understanding the  medical corps was desperate for  volunteers. Right now, soldier, it's me who is  in need of volunteers. There's a  dozen Yankees in that stand of trees  between us. Stuck there from the  retreat. Come daylight they can shoot  us down for sport. I call this nail: Northern Aggression. I call this nail: a free nigger. Show some respect -- these nails are  making a church. I call this nail: respect the church. I'm Inman. W. P. Inman. Repeating a thing doesn't improve  it. People call me Inman. They're not my friends. Thank you. I work wood. Got a piece of land.  Mostly work wood. I can clear a field. Not that comes to me. I'll say thank you for the lemonade. Esco loves the Yankees. I prefer a Yankee to a halfwit. What is it you think you'd be fighting  for? The South. And what's that when it's at home? Pop, you causing trouble? No. You cut the wood, you carry the water  for good old King Cotton. Now you  want to fight for him. Somebody has  to explain it to me. Don't even try. How's the lemonade? Sweet? That's Teague and his boys. I'd  recommend you kick them out except a  man don't kick a snake. One time the  Teague family owned the whole of  Cold Mountain. My farm, your farm,  all belonged to his grand-daddy.  Teague wanted this place bad. You  got it. He's here sniffing out an  advantage. I'm wetter than a fish. I'm all right. If there's a war we'll all fight. Call a thing a war makes it a  challenge to some men. Say again. You're laughing at me. You're always carrying a tray. I'll do that. I can't get much wetter. Reverend. I have some sheet music. Belonged to  my father. No use to me. I should probably get along. I think so. Those who follow Lincoln, or preach  abolition, best keep one eye open  when they're sleeping, Old Bogey Man  might get you! Are you the law all of a sudden? That's right, son. Home Guard for  Haywood County. I'm the law from  today. You all go fight now. We'll  watch your sweethearts. You might be safer back in Charleston. I'm going to walk back inside the  Chapel. Just some quiet. Ada... Let's go! I'm not dying. Says he ain't about to die. My condolences to you all. Keep an eye on the negro. They want  what the white man got -- all of you  watch out your brave boys give their  lives to war and meantime your slaves  carry murder, rape and arson to your  firesides. Most of these men will be dead by  the morning or, if they're stubborn,  by nightfall. I have other men outside  in the quadrangle waiting for the  beds. So, any kind word will be a blessing. It's the heat. I'm sorry. They rot. Don't pray. If they're not God fearing  you can stir up a hornet's nest. Pigeon River. Little East Fork. They ramble. Names of loved ones. This man is dead. By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor  of this great state of North Carolina:  any soldier turned deserter is guilty  of treason and shall be hunted down  like a dog. -- Any man takes in a deserter is  likewise guilty of treason. The Home Guard is powered to enter  any place it sees fit, without notice  or constraint. Names of all deserters  will be posted in every town,  published in every newspaper. It's taken me too long, but I've  come to pay my respects. I reckoned you might need fattening  up. This house must bring bad luck. Killed  my granddaddy to lose it, then my  daddy died on account of not having  it, then your daddy died on account  of getting it. We should burn it  down. Lot to manage without help. Need a  hand with that pump? I'm happy to volunteer. The war? I wanted to go. But you  know: too old, too literate. Plus I  got no spleen. Lost it from a horse's  kick. That's the thing about an organ. You  don't know you need it till you lost  it. I want to clear this path. I can  just as soon do it and talk as stand  around and talk. Then you can say  men beat a path to your door. Would you rather I did my job? See if there's any material I should  confiscate. For the war effort. Good manners didn't quite make it to  these mountains. If it don't yield  meat, or you can't sit on it, or  suck on it... And you're sleeping all right? These  cold dark nights? It's going to be a long hard winter. Will you look at the state of this  place! Getting better all the time. Seems that way. I wouldn't hurry. War's almost done. Where'd you take your wound? Before I was born. Never saw a thing  in this world, not a tree a gun or a  woman. Though I put my hand on all  three. Couple of things I felt back  there I'd sure liked to have had a  long look at. What would you give for that? To  have your eyeballs back for ten  minutes? Ten minutes! Wouldn't give an Indian  head cent. I fear it might turn me  hateful. That's sure what seeing's done to  me. That ain't the way I meant it. You  said ten minutes. It's having a thing  and then the loss I'm talking about. Then we don't agree. There's not  much I wouldn't give for ten minutes  of someplace. Someplace or someone. Same difference. You watch yourself. They're shooting  men who take themselves a walk. Next. I'll cut your hair, but I ain't about  to shave you. That thing opens up,  your head's liable to falloff. That your daddy's coat? Don't suit you. I can't get up to your place this  week. She's mad at me -- -- more than I can do to keep this  place half-managed. I'm ready-to  stop, I tell you. I just want to sit  on my porch with Sal, watch my boys  in the field, holler good job! every  hour or so. And waiting on a feller. Look down our well. She should! Look down our well with  a mirror, you'll see the future.  S'what they say. You do it! Don't make that face. See anything? Hey! I'd pay a dollar for an egg. A piece  of cheese. Don't let go. Just back up, nice and  steady, do this all in reverse, you're  going to end up with her draped back  over your animal. I've killed several of them. What part of God's business is  throwing a woman down a gorge. Is she dead? Where does she live? Shut your mouth. I don't want a sermon  every time I ask a question. This your place? You're going to put her back where  she sleeps. So you reckoned to kill her. You find me some paper and a pen. Sign says ferry, five dollars. What's the name of this thing? I can give you thirty dollars script. Hey! Hey! Wait! No. Get out. I should have shot you when I had  the chance. You're nothing like me and the last  thing I want right now is a  conversation. Jesus, god! There's nowhere I'm going with you  except to Hellfire! It's not yours. You take it, you  make us another enemy. You're a  Christian -- don' t you know your  commandments? My old bull, wandered off and died  in this here creek. Fouled up our  water is how I found it. Reckon I need a train of mules. Then what? Where you two sports heading? I don't know where he's heading. I'm  going down the road. And I got a  good way to go before nightfall. Charitable of you to make a stop.  Ain't for me to be curious. Give me that saw. Come on. Let's do this in chapters. You might want to leave off that  water for a day or two. There'll be a tang, I'd imagine. There's my place. Hope you can stomach  a yard chock-full of females. Brought  my woman home, she showed up with  her three so-called sisters and their  brats. The noise in that place is  something awful. It's why I go  hunting. It is on a bit of a tilt. Them  females. They all roll down one end  each night! -- In the clover What's up? He's got a shit coming on. It's  overdue. And he's a Preacher? Like a Christian? Like a Christian. Good God. These two boys is stopping for supper.  They're on the road to Atonement. So what is it when it's at home? Take them all and leave the saw. Be  a sight more use. They love to scrub a man. Put the water on the boil. It's my liquor, gets their titties  swinging. He doesn't know what I am. Thanks. He's gone now. Look! His eyes have  gone. What? I'm leaving soon as I'm full. Got a bunch of traps needs visiting.  I'll be back tomorrow, before dark.  You'll still be here? My house is your house. Like to wash their hands and pray. Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and  miles to go before sunset. I'll just quickly lie down. You go tend to him. I'll be seeing you. You little bitch! Look at you! Cover  yourself up! He's dead. This man's dead! I'm looking to get out of this. They  drag us back to fight -- we're just  target practice for the Federal boys. You run, we're all running with you,  the lame and the stupid, of which we  number both. Either way we're fucked. Run or don't  run. Just give me some warning so I can  tell the guard -- I'm not getting  shot again for some cause I don't  believe in. Hey! No! Get these sacks of shit under the  ground. What you looking to catch? With that trap. Still but the two of you up there,  is it? When we get a cold night, camped  out, trying to keep the rule of law,  protecting girls like you from  Federals and deserters, that's a  thought warms us ain't it? -- the two of you up there  on my Grand-daddy's farm, dressed in  men's clothes. Warms us right up.  What you got in the sacks? Looks like human heads! Eh? Looks  like a bunch of heads. We got  competition! Fighting. Different fighting. Mister -- you could fix me I'd be in  your everlasting debt. Afternoon. Don't spread out. Why they spreading  out? I'm not spreading out. I'm sitting  here. Never knew a man worked in his field  with a shotgun. There's a war on. Got to watch out for the Bogey Man. Get off my land. Your boys come back. Ain't seen my boys in four years.  They're fighting other boys, not old  men and women. He means us. He's referring there to  us. So you won't care if we take a look  around? What I gotta give you? A chicken? A  lamb? Sure. Right then. Thing is -- you got one barrel and  there's five of us. Not a fair fight. Bogey Man! Bogey Man! You're harbouring deserters. I can  confiscate every animal on this farm,  every plate, every sheet, every little  pellet of chicken shit -- I can  confiscate your old lady's asshole,  so don't offer me a bird. Hey! You got your bait. Set it on the  hook. How long have I been sleeping? I can't stop here. I'm a deserter.  They find me here things could be  bad for you. How long you been up here? Last time I checked it was '64. Twenty six years! I could be at killing for days  sometimes, in the hand to hand, my  feet against the feet of my enemy  and I always killed him and he never  killed me. I guess he did. It's true... What you remember. Ada. -- Sometimes I think I'm crazy when  I'm just hungry -- Ada Monroe. She was. I don't know. Or if she'd  know me. I'm like the boy who goes  out in winter for firewood comes  back in the spring with a whistle. I've had to put myself in the way of  people's kindness. The passenger pigeons fly south, the  berries ripen. Whether I see them or  not, whether a man dies, or a war is  won. She gave me a book. Ada Monroe. Man  by the name of Bartram. Wrote about  his travels. I carried that book  through every battle. I left it  someplace, got to get it back.  Sometimes just reading the name of a  place near home -- Sorell Cove, Fire  Scale Ridge -- was enough to bring  me to tears. Thing is I've been  thinking -- those places belonged to  people before us, to the Indian --  and he had a different name. What  did he call Sorell Cove? How can a  name not even the real name break  your heart? It's her, she's the place  I'm heading. And I hardly know her.  So how can a person who's maybe not  even a real person -- I don't know  what I'm talking about -- I have to  close my eyes... I have a deal to thank you for. I'm one man alone. I'm a Confederate  soldier on furlough. I have no bad  intention. I need shelter and food. Can I at least sleep in the corn  crib -- just for some shelter? I'll  be on my way come morning. Fair enough. Thank you. No, I mean to give it to you. Is your baby sick? I'm sorry. There's no hunting on the road, just  cress and -- I could do that for you in the  morning. It's what I'd gladly do for you for  what you're gladly doing for me. I'm  Inman by the way. That's my name. Glad to know you both. I got a blanket. Pretty much. These boots are good  boots. Good night. I don't know. I'll try. I'll go. I'll go, shall I? She don't speak. Is she feeble then? This coat's warm. 'Night now. I can try and fight them. We got all day. How long does he want? Hey! Leave  some for the rest of us. Move away from the baby. Take off your boots. Take off your pants, and your shirt. You'd better get running before you  catch your death of cold. It's frozen. How long it been there  for? Yeah. Ow! It's good. I think it's good. Evening. Hope we didn't disturb you. Name's Teague. Do I know you? You a deserter? -- don't mind if I  just warm up at your fire. That your wife? He your wife? Look pretty romantic by the fire.  Don't they? Your boyfriend's got a nice bit of  flesh on him. Close your eyes slip  inside that shirt get two good  handfuls -- dark enough I'd be  willing. I'm just kidding. Tell him, I'm just kidding. He's just kidding. Did you answer my question -- about  your military status? Oh, so like a hero's discharge. And your boyfriend? I'm sorry -- he's fat, he's simple  and got titties -- but you're  insisting he ain't a woman. God damn!  Don't that sausage smell outstanding. Mighty outstanding! There's a new  phrase. Mighty outstanding. Listen,  don't tell me -- you left your papers  somewhere. Your hero's discharge. For mighty  outstanding valour. And where, where, where is your house? But you're up the mountain. On honeymoon. I'm pretty fucking funny tonight. Is he going to play? You gonna play that fiddle? Evening, Mrs. Where's Georgia? Where's Georgia? Georgia's like my armpit. Worse,  it's like yours. Want some sausage? Thanks. You is Home Guard? Yes, ma'am. You is Teague? I'm known! That bastard Teague. Really. Bad words. Folk always put the curse  words in front of your name. Okay. We heard there were deserters in  these parts. Hiding out in a big  cave. You don't know where this cave is? You do, Stobes! He means -- Ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch!  It's this side! He's always getting  lost. That cave -- we live there! --  it's over on Big Stomp. Tell you how  I always find it. There's a big old  locust tree fell down across the  path, that points straight at it,  like a finger, always a dozen  squirrels round that tree. You gets  to the tree, sit on it, and there's  your entrance, straight in front of  you, tree points at it. Come right  to your hand, them squirrels -- -- Chrrrpppp! Chrrrrppp! Sounds good. Okay, let's eat, let's  hear some music. What'd you make of that? Heartbreaking. Stand over by that tree. Over by that tree. Over there. Take  your boyfriend. Don't smile. What? Quit smiling. Put your hat over your face. What do you mean? Cover your face with your hat. Ada? Ada Monroe? Then I believe I made a mistake. If I knew where to go I'd go there. I may need to. Not lately. I'm sorry. I was trying to be quiet. -- I got no appetite left to be in a  room with wounded men. It's not a face you recognised. I got three letters. Carried them in  that book you gave me. The Bertram. Whenever I could. If you never got  them I can summarize. I pray you're well. I pray I'm in  your thoughts. You are all that keeps  me from sliding into some dark place. A thousand moments. They're like a  bag of tiny diamonds glittering in a  black heart. Don't matter if they're  real or things I made up. The shape  of your neck. The way you felt under  my hands when I pulled you to me. You're playing a piano and I'm  standing outside. That kiss -- which I've kissed again  every day of my walking. Maybe you can't see my face, but if  you could see my inside, my whatever  you want to name it, my spirit, that's  the fear I have deeper than any gash  on my neck. I think I'm ruined. They  kept trying to put me in the ground,  but I wasn't ready, no ma'am, no  more ready than that scoundrel in  there's not ready to die on us. But  if I had goodness, I lost it. If I  had anything tender in me I shot it  dead. I'll say goodnight. Right. More a question could she put up  with me. Sure. Ada, I want to marry you. If you'll  have me. I marry you. I marry you. I marry  you. Why's that funny? I can wait for you. Not for all the gold dollars in the  Federal Bank. You go ahead. I'll follow with the  horse at a pace your daddy can  tolerate. It's safer this way. No one has  quarrel with you. I gather I need permission if I reckon  on living at Black Cove. We'll get to you by nightfall. Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some  category of fly born on the hide of  a cow. It flies up into a tree and  waits and waits until it smells cow.  It can wait a year, two years, I  don't know, maybe longer. Then a cow  comes along and it wakes up, flies  down, lays its eggs on the cow.  There's purpose for you. Don't look round. How many men does he have? I got a conversation stopper. Closer we get to that broken ground  the better. You hold on tight, do you hear? When  I say three, look round, nice and  slow. One, two, three. God damn! You're a hard fucker to  put down. Good directions to that cave from  the fat boy -- saw the squirrels,  sat on the tree made some friends,  brought some back with me. Come out of there. No, sir. Here's fine. I just have to shoot the horse from  under you. Shoot her. She's not mine. You riding  Mr Teague's mare? I am. He dead? I hope so. Look, how old are you? Give me your  gun and ride home, I'm done fighting.  I'm sick of it. I give you my gun you'll shoot me  dead. I will not shoot you, but nor am I  walking down that mountain looking  over my shoulder for you. That's what they call a conundrum. I  tell you what I've got on my side. What have you got on your side? The confidence of youth. Amen !
