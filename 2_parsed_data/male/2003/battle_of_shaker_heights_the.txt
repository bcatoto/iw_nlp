 Mien Prisoner!  You will write your mother. Tell her  how you will die now.  You will write. How you die alone.  Write.  Enough. Now you will beg for your  life.  The protocol says we should -  I am the fucking protocol. Beg!  Beg - for - your - life!  Silence. Now I have a little fun.  There are no rules in war.  I shower in the blood of my victims --  Don't shoot, please.  No, really, not in the neck -  Kelly?  I mean - that's Irish, right?  Wow man, this is a really beautiful  scene and all, but I have to  interrupt. Why the fuck did you have to shoot  that cap so close to my neck? You  gave me a powder burn.  Well, what was that whole creepy  death wish thing about?  Sometimes I get so caught up in the  moment.  Inspired, wasn't it?  Dude, you made him write to his  mother? Who are you, Dr. Phil?  Can we get up now?  Might as well. There's only an hour  left anyway.  Admit it. You were scared.  That Willys yours?  Real funny, Ernswiler. You might  still get your chance to die today.  Character building? Those crazy guys  from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock.  D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At  Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a  guy who actually injected himself  with malaria.  Where do you live, anyway?  That explains the death wish. Me  too. What street?  Hmm, don't know it.  Langely Prep.  Well, I got kicked out of Shaker  Heights High because my birdhouse  came unglued in honors woodshop.  No matter. We're all soldiers here.  That's right./Here, here./ Whooping,  cheers, etc.  You should come over some time. Service our lawnmower.  How bourgeois. Cheerio then.  Sergeant Keller! How was the war?  Did we win?  As usual, your cynicism is refreshing.  You should get that checked.  Son of Eve. You are very dirty.  More - empathy?  No, no more cacti. Too busy.  Simplicity is best.  Now Keller, who needs that sandwich  more - you or the daughter of a crack  addict trying to make a new life?  That went well.  What the fuck are you looking at, GI  Jane?  No really, what makes you think you  can look at me?  That's pretty funny. You got dental  insurance?  What? What?  Whoops!  And here, at Gettysburg, the ranks  of Union soldiers fought bravely on.  They were willing to give their lives  so that others might be free.  Is there a problem Mr. Ernswiler?  You upset Bridget.  You need to apologize.  Why are you fucking with me? You  little fucker. Want to play, fuckface?  Let's see what Beetle Bailey's got  in his knapsack.  Kelly. Hey.  Just a couple days a month, to get a  heads-up on the latest stuff. What  are you doing?  Is that all? Don't bother. I have a  couple extras at home. I could give  you one if you want.  My dad's real into hoarding.  Grant's field flask.  Forget him.  What is he, some kind of sadist?  Jesus, she must think you're really  screwed up. Are you?  Take this. That'll shut them up.  Stonewall Jackson's.  Can you imagine that? Losing your  leg and getting back up on your horse?  Unbelievable. What balls.  He's got so much crap crammed in  here he doesn't even notice when  it's missing. I saw a backpack in  here somewhere.  I thought he had a couple.  Trust me, you shouldn't. Where'd your old one go?  How?  You let someone take it?  Sounds like your mouth gets you into  trouble a lot.  Tabby, this is Kelly.  Shut up.  Very funny. We're paying attention  to you, are you happy now?  Minnie's making sloppy joes. Want  one?  The fiancé.  Listen, I'm going to the flea market  on Saturday. I have a line on a couple  dealers. You could get a backpack  there.  Especially if you know who to talk  to.  Hey fuckface. Like my new hat? I  just joined the Boy Scouts.  You're a regular Howie Mandel.  Okay babe. One day you and me will be alone.  And won't that be nice?  That there's actual sand from Iwo  Jima.  Or your sister's sandbox.  Well, it don't come with no  certificate of authenticity. I could write one up for you, I  suppose. Get it notarized.  No, that's quite all right. Actually,  I'm in the market for medals.  Sure. I got a couple purple hearts.  A Silver Star. DSC. Can't sell them  to you though. They were gramp's.  Are you sure?  They have a lot of sentimental value   Yeah. How much?  A lot.  What's this?  General Ulysses S. Grant's field  flask, my friend.  Throw in one of those backpacks and  we'll call it even.  Exactly. That's why the resale value  is so high.  Don't be so naïve. We all have our  skeletons. Some of them just pay  more than others.  Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets  everything right, don't they?  Anything military?  What do you want for the box?  Fifteen.  Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going  to go to school?  Ah, you have that luxury.  I didn't have much say in the matter.  Everything has been decided for me  since birth. I'm not whining about  it. Play the hand you're dealt, right?  Are you crazy? My life sucks.  Everyone's always telling me what to  do. You can't fight it. Go with the  flow.  She got to go where she wanted. Sarah  Lawrence. Six years. She's almost  done with grad school. Yale.  I don't know. I mean, she drives off  in her car in September. For all we  know, she could just pull her car  over in Albany and sleep there until  May.  It was a joke. Joke?  What happened to your face?  Same guy?  What are you going to do about it?  Of course not. But there are  alternatives…  Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd  Special Operations Wing?  Well do you want to get this guy or  what?  All right. Let's get the fuck out of  here, then.  I have some things to show you.  Once we've gathered the intelligence,  the plan will reveal itself.  No, it limits our scope - what's the  objective?  Easy enough. 'Nam's probably our go- to war for that sort of thing. I  have the declassified briefs from  the Phoenix Project around here  somewhere.  Of course we'll drop what we're doing  because what you're doing must be  more important.  I'll find those reports.  Christ Kelly, I let you go out on a  little supply line assist and you're  gone for days. Come on.  Enough with the mind pollution, Hanoi  Hannah.  So, you have a thing for my sister?  Everybody does.  Oh really, like what?  You don't wear women's clothes when  you're alone, do you?  Wha?  Keller. There's a meteor shower.  Oh, you mean Emmett? They didn't  have an empty bed for him at Care  House.  He just needs a place to sleep for  the night.  I've been straight for four years,  almost five. A third of your life.  I hate to tell you this, but I'm not  your problem anymore.  Let me know. I can wait.  Keller, there's a meteor shower.  Let me see. Don't be a farb, give  them up.  The coast is clear.  Let me prepare to deploy.  We've planned for every contingency  using the tried and true techniques  of the last great world power.  Stay low. On my signal.  Can I help you, young man?  I'm not interested.  Smile worker bee. I'll be your boss  some day.  What an asshole. His mom gave me  cookies, though.  Don't ask stupid questions. Let's go  home and listen.  It was a five-watt FM bug, so we  should be in range -  Be patient. It's voice activated, so  we'll get everything. Trust me. It's  going to be great.  We reconnoiter tomorrow at nineteen  hundred hours.  Did you make this with more chili  pepper than usual?  That sounds nice.  It's really too perfect, actually.  I can't describe. Just hit play.  It's all cued up.  But baby, my birthday's coming up.  Come on. A little action. A little  prime time action.  That's the point. That's what makes  it sexxxy. Dangerous.  Exactly.  I have a few notes jotted down.  She dots her I's with hearts. And  her L's are loopier. The L is very  important.  Sometimes collateral damage can't be  avoided.  Pretty good. I think we're ready to  manufacture a document.  Begin. "Hey Daddy. It's your birthday  and you've been a very bad boy. But  so has the baby. Both baby and Daddy  have to get punished, only this time   - baby makes the rules. Await further  instructions at school tomorrow --  -- Baby will be waiting where Daddy  least expects her. Love, Bridgie."  Yes!  Do you have everything?  We can't afford any errors.  I wish I could be there to see it.  It's a day that will live in infamy.  I don't hear you coming up with  anything.  Nothing, you bad girl.  See you soon, my naughty baby.  It's my birthday! I'm going to get a  present.  Damn it, fuckface. What're you smiling  about? You wish you were me.  Mr. Palmer? May I be excused?  Daddy's here for the Easter egg hunt.  Ooh, push my buttons.  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You little minx.  Yes, I need to get a message to  Bridget Shumann. This is MENSA.  Bridgie? Come on, daddy's sick. He  needs his medicine.  I brought our friend along. He's  happy to see you.  What the fuck are you all looking  at?  Look, he's got a hard on.  Eeeeew.  You're kidding me.  To Operation Mincemeat.  How does it feel to give better than  you get?  You want some more?  That's my boy.  -- But I told you I want to take  German --  German's a Cold War language. You  can't get any kind of State Department  position without more diverse  linguistic training than that. You'll  take Chinese.  Are we on the same page?  Same page.  But have you ever noticed how in  movies they always bite the grenade  before they throw it?  You come from a creative family, do  you?  Is there nothing you can't discuss?  Here, Kelly, try a bit of these leeks.  Minnie has a way with the white sauce.  My dad has this friend who's a  director. He's shooting a documentary  for the History Channel.  He needs some guys to do a reenactment  of some European theater battles for  him.  I haven't asked you yet.  Well, if you want to. Next weekend.  But you have to take it seriously.  From what I've seen, you play fast  and loose with your characterizations.  This has got to be straight up.  Like back in the dining room?  "I noticed your magnolias. Very fine  specimens." That was real?  You just seem to have your own agenda,  that's all.  I'm just saying. I know the difference  between fantasy and reality.  I don't know.  Why didn't you tell me your dad was  a burn-out?  Kelly! I told some of your teachers  about your presentation. We're all  really looking forward to it.  I tracked you down. There's someone  I'd like you to meet.  Are you one too?  And what do you see in that?  I see.  And do you think it's brave getting  trench foot and syphilis, eating  another ration of spoiled frank and  beans out of a dented can?  Yeah, that wouldn't be much fun,  would it?  Parts of it were kind of fun though.  I got separated from my platoon and  lived for two weeks in the forest of  the Ardennes living off what I could  kill. I felt very close to the land.  I met him when my mom made me go  around caroling with the Youth Group.  Does it matter?  I don't know. You tell me.  I told you not to play him for money.  Exactly. You should know better.  What do you want.  That woman's calling you.  Likewise. So, doing a little business?  Not at all. But I'd love to, anyway.  What's your problem? She's pretty  cute.  Don't you want your soda?  So filming's on Saturday. Can you  make it?  Good. It's gonna be really cool.  He's got an explosives expert coming.  What's up?  Maybe you should talk to my dad about  it.  Of course. He loves you. He was  talking the other day about helping  you out. Want to go to Dartmouth?  He was. If you applied for Spring  Semester, he could "pull some  strings."  Yeah, probably not.  That's bullshit.  Tell that to my family. They're like  your fucking fan club.  Even Tabby likes you.  Well, she's inviting you to the  wedding.  But you probably won't enjoy that  much, will you?  Good, I'll call mom's nephew Fletcher  and tell him to expect a little  action.  He's twelve. Let me give some advice.  He's very into sharks at the moment.   Not tonight, ma.  Are you with the 101st or the 82nd?  Whatever. Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be a while setting up. Some of  the other boys are over by craft  service.  The snack table. It's over there.  Someone will come get you when we're  ready.  Bart? Oh, Harrison's son. I don't  know.  No where.  I ought to fucking kill you.  You had to do it.  You just do whatever the fuck you  want. And consequences don't matter,  do they?  What the fuck do you think she's  going to do, run off with you?  You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy.  She's a Yale grad student. Talk about  living in a fucking fantasy world.  Once again, you've displayed your  uncanny ability to nail the truth of  a character.  Kelly! There you are. I was just  telling the class about our special  treat today. Mr. Ernswiler is going  to be giving the three first-period  history classes a little talk about  the Civil War.  Let's all make our way in an orderly  fashion down to the auditorium, shall  we?  Orderly, I said orderly.  Well, what are we waiting for? I'm  so looking forward to hearing your  views.  I did that too. When I was seven.  What, they re-assign you to the  bicycle brigade?  Too bad, cause I'm not. Remember  that little show I put on for the  school?  Oh, come on. Pants down? Doll? Hard  on?  And did you hear me and Bridget aren't  going out anymore because of it?  Yeah well, let's get this over with.  Did you call me a homo?  No time like the present.  Stop it!  Get off me.  Don't sit any of Mathilda's sisters  next to me if you can help it. Oh, hello. So nice to see you. Thank  you for coming.  Where's the priest?  He should be here any minute. Calm  down.  What the fuck are you doing?  I uninvited you.  Why are you wearing that?  I can't let you come in.  Because you know why. Just go home.  Hey. Kelly.  Not bad.  Did you get punched?  I know the feeling. Come on in and  watch some television. Don't worry,  this one's bolted to the wall. As  you can see, my reputation precedes  me.  Any battles this weekend?  Busy, busy.  Answer me this: how come no one ever  reenacts the Vietnam War?  I guess it would.  Folks dressed up like your mom and  me. People reenacting fleeing to  Canada, burning draft cards. I guess  that would ruin the spirit of the  thing, now wouldn't it?  I bet you could.  Hey.  Yeah. The have this intensive summer  orientation thing.  Well, it's optional, but dad thinks  it would be "a good way to meet  people."  He usually is.  Thanks.  Is that everything?  Everything you'd let me bring.  Give me a break.  This is boring.  Yeah. Let's see that slide of the  wife again.  Remarkable, remarkable. And they  never knew?  The real kicker was moving those  cutouts of tanks around. The thought  we had a whole regiment over there,  but it was just a couple of us and  those Hollywood props.  You're damned right. We practically  won the thing right there. Now this is more like it. Anyone  care to place a wager on the table?  I can't imagine having more fun that  I am now.  You're never been to a French  whorehouse, I take it.  Oh, my.
