Look at them. Men, women, kids.  Boy, did they love him. You see,  Steve, Adolf Hitler touched  something deep, real deep and savage  and barbaric, and it won't just go  away overnight. It's got to be  rooted out. You know what I think?  I think they were all Nazis. And  let's face it, their leaders, those  bastards now on trial in Nuremberg,  couldn't have done it alone. It's  these people, they gave all the  help that was needed. Willingly. That's him.  Furtw�ngler. Wilhelm  Furtw�ngler. So, you never heard of him. Nope. Do you know who Arturo Toscanini  is? Sure. He's as big as Toscanini, maybe  even bigger. In this neck of the  woods, he's probably Bob Hope and  Betty Grable rolled into one. Jeez, and I never heard of him. You were in insurance before the  war. Right. Claims assessor. Conscientious, determined, dogged. They said I was dogged? Well, they say here that when you  went on a case, you stayed on it. Now we can't take every Nazi in  this country to trial, although I  would like to; it's an  impossibility. So we're going for  the big boys in industry, education,  law, culture. Like this bandleader. Well, he's more than just a  bandleader, Steve. He's a great  conductor, a gifted artist. But we  believe that he sold himself to  the devil. Your number one priority  from this moment on is to connect  him to the Nazi Party. Don't be  impressed by him. I want the folks  back home to understand why we  fought this war. Find Wilhelm  Furtw�ngler guilty. He represents  everything that was rotten in  Germany. Stay put, Steve. There is some  other stuff that I'd like for you  to see here. Background. Oh, one thing that may be a problem.  Our Occupation Authorities in  Wiesbaden have a duty to help these  poor unfortunates with their  defence. They keep repeating: 'We  must be just, we must be seen to  be just.' Well, I've only one thing  to say to the liberals in Wiesbaden:  fuck 'em. You answer to no one but me. Is  that understood? Show him the film. That is the hand that dropped the  bombs on defenceless Rotterdam,  Brussels, Belgrade. That is the  hand that destroyed the cities,  villages and homes of Russia. That  is the hand that held the whip  over the Polish, Yugoslav, French  and Norwegian slaves. That is the  hand that took their food. Next reel, please. Sanitary conditions were so  appalling that heavy equipment had  to be brought in to speed the work  of cleaning up. This was Bergen  Belsen. Remember, men, no fraternisation.  In a German town, if you bow to a  pretty girl or pat a blond child,  you bow to all that Hitler stood  for. You bow to his reign of blood.   You caress the ideology that meant  death and destruction. You never  know who was a member of the Nazi  Party. Don't be fooled. Don't  fraternise. Cigarettes, chewing gum? We're gonna have the heating fixed  by tonight. Fr�ulein, this is Major Arnold.  Sir, this is your secretary,  Fr�ulein Emmi Straube. Her file's  on your desk. They sent her over  from Admin. I'll leave you to it. You live here, in Berlin? You do shorthand and typing? Okay, let's see. How long were you  in the camp for? Says here because of your father.  What's that mean? Your mother, too. And your father was executed. I'm gonna call you Emmi, you're  gonna call me Steve. Okay? I got a list of stuff here I'd  like you to get for me. If you need anything, let me know. Steve. Think you can get me any of that? Mine's the Eleventh. I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a  record player? You have that, too? What's in those files? You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he  calls again, you say you know  nothing. We're gonna keep him  waiting while I get acquainted  with his case and with the  witnesses. And, God help me, with  Beethoven. Yeah. Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major  Arnold. Sir. For Chrissakes I hate that shit,  cut it out. I'm very sorry. I'm Steve. What's your name? David. David Wills. I'm your liaison  officer with the Allied Kommandatura  Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir. Sounds a lot of run. So they sent the big guns to check  up on me. We recruiting children  now? I guess so, sir. You call me sir again and I'll  make you listen to Beethoven. Where you from, David? was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped  in '36. My parents, they sent me  to my uncle in Philadelphia. They  were to follow. But they delayed  and... Our family name was Weill. But  that doesn't sound well in English.  My uncle changed it to Wills and... Come in, Emmi, this is your office,  too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David  Wills. He is here to watch over us. I guess you admire musicians. Some. Don't. This is like a criminal  investigation, David. Musicians,  morticians, doctors, lawyers,  butchers, clerks. They're all the  same. We have a duty, a moral duty. Sit down, Werner. I want you to understand why you're  here. This is an investigation  into Wilhelm Furtw�ngler, former  Prussian Privy Councillor, banned  from public life under Control  Council Directive No 24 and who's  applied to come before the Tribunal  of Artists of the Denazification  Commission. I'm interested in what  he was up to from 1933 to the end  of the war, understood? Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section  since 1936. What instrument did  you play? First oboe. I have your questionnaire here. It  says you were never a member of  the Nazi Party. Absolutely not. No, I was never a Nazi, I have no  interest in politics, I'm a musician - Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube  has to take down what you say. Straube? Any relation to Colonel  Joachim Straube? It's a great honour to meet you,  Fraulein. Your father was a great  patriot. Dr. Furtw�ngler is a great musician.  He actively opposed the Nazis and  later on he helped many Jews to  escape. Then how do you explain him being  made a Prussian Privy Councillor? It was Hermann Goering. I was told  he just made the maestro his Privy  Councillor, no questions asked.  Although Dr. Furtw�ngler stood up  to him. And to Dr. Goebbels. He also conducted for Hitler, didn't  he? Yes, that's true, but he refused  to give the Nazi salute. He kept  his baton in his right hand. In  Hitler's presence. That was a brave  act... Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's  birthday with some heroic piece by  Wagner but without the Nazi salute?  Bravo. It was Beethoven's Ninth. Do you really think it was brave?  Didn't he bow to him and shake his  hand? But this was the same guy who  conducted for Adolf on his birthday. And what about the Nuremberg Rally? Oh! The evening before, I see... Politics and art must be kept  separate. I'll remember that. But  let me see if you can help me with  something I just don't understand.  I'd really like to know why all  you guys are so crazy about him.  What's his secret? You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes  when he was making a speech? I've  seen 'em on films. Was looking at Furtw�ngler like  that? When you got to the crescendo. You think a whole orchestra, what,  a hundred and forty or so guys,  could be orchestrated? I guess it's possible. So, what does the Russki want? Colonel Dymshitz asked specially  to see you. 'Dim-shits'? What the hell are they doing? They're trying to sort out some of  the works of art the Nazis stole  from occupied territories. Who  really owns what? That's Colonel  Dymshitz, on the far side. art historian, head of the famous  Leningrad Museum of Art. He is an  expert on German culture. Je suis navr�, Colonel, cette  peinture n'est pas la propri�t� de  I'union sovi�tique mats bien cette  de la France. What's he saying? Henri, what is  you saying? He's saying that picture is the  property of France C'est un Braque qui avec Picasso  �tait un des pionniers du cubisme. It's a Barque. We can produce the provenance of  this Braque, you say provenance? Colonel. Pleasure. Not yet. Hey, just a moment, you should  have discussed this with me first. We can't drop a case just like  that. I clicked my heels, saluted and  bowed at the same time. That's right. I was raised very  strictly. So don't speak before  you are spoken to! Respect your elders and your  betters! Eating is eating... and... Right. So, this is going to be  very formal, too, now. Lieutenant  David Wills requests die pleasure  of die company of Fraulein Emmi  Straube at dinner any night she  cares. David, need to ask you something.  You heard this rumour the British  found something called the Hinkel  Archive? Yes. So what is it? The British occupy the building  where this guy, Hinkel, ran the  Nazi Ministry of Culture and it  seems they've... they've discovered  his secret archive. What's that mean? I don't know, but the British are  excited about it, I know that. The  rumour is Hinkel kept a file on  every artist working in the Third  Reich. Jeez. And you think the British'll  share it with their Allies? Major Richards said he'd call to  let us know. That's big of him. Okay, better question the next  witness. I bet you a bottle of  French champagne he tells us the  baton story inside ten minutes. Five minutes. It's a bet. You're the witness,  Emmi. Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second  violinist since 1935. What's it  mean, second violinist? It means I wasn't good enough to  be a first violinist. Good, and according to your  questionnaire, Helmuth, you never  joined the Nazi Party. Me? Never.  Never. I... I know everyone now says they  were never Nazis but in my case it  is absolutely one hundred per cent  true. I am a Catholic, it would  have been totally against my  conscience. Is it true you're going to interview  Dr. Furtw�ngler today? I'll ask the questions, Helmuth. Excuse me. Did you know that he  refused to give the Nazi salute  when Hitler was present in the  audience? The problem was how could he avoid  giving the Devil's salute when  Satan was actually sitting there. And, I said, 'Dr. Furtw�ngler, why  not enter with the baton in your  right hand? Hitler will be sitting  in the front row. If you give the  salute with the baton in your right  hand it'll look like you're going  to poke his eyes out.' He was...He was really grateful to  me for that. After the concert,  I... I stole that baton as a memento  of a great act of courage. I still  have it. I should have brought it  to show you. I hope I'm not going  too fast for you, Fraulein?- Straube. Any relation to Colonel  Joachim Straube? I am deeply honoured to be in your  presence, Fraulein Straube. Your  father was a true patriot, a man  of God. You have a question for Helmuth,  David? Yes. What was the orchestra's  reaction when they asked you to  play for Hitler's birthday? Oh, we didn't play for his birthday,  we played the evening before - it  was the 19th of April not the 20th. Do you know Hans Hinkel? Do I know Hans Hinkel? That's what I asked. Do I know Hans Hinkel? You seem to understand the question,  now how about answering it? Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of  Culture; how could I know such a  man?  I I hear the British have his... his  archive, files, records. Do you know what's in this archive? How could I know what's in the  archive? Okay, you can go now, Helmuth. Get  out. Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down,  Emmi. We're going to keep him  waiting, too. Emmi, get us some coffee, will  you? And, Emmi, don't offer him  coffee. Don't even greet him, okay? Okay, Emmi, go get him. I didn't hear anyone invite you to  sit down. Sit there. I want you to understand why you're  here. You're automatically banned  from public life under Control  Council Directive No 24. We're  here to look into your case before  you appear in front of the Tribunal  for Artists of the Denazification  Commission. You understand that? What they do in Austria doesn't  interest me one little bit. Okay?   I have your questionnaire here, Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm  Furtw�ngler, born Berlin, January  1886. Orchestral conductor. And  you say here you were never a member  of the Nazi Party. Could you tell us about being made  a Prussian Privy Councillor. How  did that happen to a non-Party  member? What about Vice-President of the  Chamber of Music, you used that  title didn't you? But then I suppose  you had no choice there either,  because I suppose Dr. Goebbels  just sent you a telegram saying,  Dear Mr. Vice-President. Goebbels and Goering were sure  heaping honours on you. One makes  you a Privy Councillor, the other  makes you Vice-President of the  Chamber of Music, and you weren't  even a member of the Party, how do  you explain that? Why was that? Why did you resign,  Dr. Furtw�ngler? Then why did you conduct at one of  their Nuremberg rallies? That sounds like the small print  in one of our insurance policies,  Wilhelm. And what about April 19,  1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration;  you conducted for Hitler, didn't  you? Was that in keeping with your  view that art and politics have  nothing to do with each other? How come? Doesn't sound much of a trick to  me. Sounds like you made a deal. I don't buy that. I keep hearing you helped a lot of  Jews to escape. How did you do  that? Did you call someone you knew? Let me me help you, then. You picked  up the phone and made a call - 'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking.  Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy  musician I want you to help. He  needs a permit to get to Paris.' Or maybe you called Goebbels or  Goering? You were so close you  were in the same shithouse as them. Sure. Your guess is as good as mine. Tough, tough! I don't know, he wasn't my case.  Why did you escape to Switzerland  just before the war ended? Why were they going to arrest you? You didn't complain about the racial  policies, just about the musical  standards, is that right? So, how did you learn that the  Gestapo was out to get you? You sure knew a lot of people in  high places. You were real close to all of them,  to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph,  to Baldur, and now Albert, So, let's hear the truth, let's  come clean. What was your Party  number? David, you remember I said I had a  question that he wouldn't be able  to answer? Well, I'm gonna ask it  now.  You ready for this, Wilhelm?  It's a tough one. Why didn't you  get out right at the start when  Hitler came to power in 1933? Why  didn't you leave Germany? I have a list of names here, people  in your profession, who got out in  '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer,  Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt... See, David? He can't answer the  question. I'll ask it again,  Wilhelm, and don't give me any  more airy-fairy, intellectual  bullshit! David Wills. Yes, sir. Well, you want me to tell him?  Okay, Major Richards wants a word with  you, sir. Why can't he just ask for me? Why  does he have to ask for you first?  Goddamn British, so correct! Steve Arnold... Dr. Furtw�ngler!  Dr. Furtw�ngler!  Please, please... Don't. It's not advisable. When I was a child, my father, he  took me to... he took me to one of  your concerts. I remember you  conducted Beethoven's Fifth  Symphony. I was deeply moved. And  I've loved music ever since. I was  grateful to you. And I've admired  you. How could you... how could  you serve those criminals? How many?  Jesus, that's dynamite! Okay. Well now. Aren't we all sociable? I've got to hand it to the British,  David. You know what those guys  are?  Decent. Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtw�ngler, do  you know Hans Hinkel? Yup, that's him, that's the guy.  You know what else the little creep  did? He kept files, close on 250,000  files. And you know what's in those  files? Who? How? Who warned you? What did Goering say? Oh boy, you're gonna love this.  Take your time with this now. Those  files contain the details of every  working artist in this country.  Those files are gonna tell us who  joined the Party, who informed and  who was helpful. Your name, please. David Wills. Over there. Fantastic! The only condition is  we have to do the work here. I  want you to collect all the files  on the boys in the band. Schubert. I don't know. Well, what is this, the office  party? May I join you? So, what have you two been up to  tonight? Hey. Don't I owe you a  bottle of French champagne? You know, David, you're a lucky  guy. I invited Emmi here but she  turned me down. You must've hidden  depths, David... C'mon, Emmi, let's dance. I'll  teach you how to jive. I'm very sorry, Major, but I  promised her mother, we have to  go. But I promised your mother. Sssh! Lieutenant Wills, telephone - What is this, a railway station? David. Wills. Hello? Who? Who in  Wiesbaden? Major. Helmuth. Guess what I am holding in my hand.  You like guessing games? Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What  are you holding in your hand? It's Dr. Furtw�ngler's baton, which  I stole. The one he kept in his right hand.   Yes, you remember. Yes, you remember. How could I forget? Show me. Show you? Yeah, show me, I want to see you  do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're  the maestro, and you have the baton  in your right hand, but you give  me the salute just the same. Not here, Major, there are people,  if anybody should see... please,  please, Major... Do it, Helmuth. Do it right. You look great doing that. And I see what you mean. You nearly  poked my eyes out. Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives  Steve the case. Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our  secret. Mister, mister, here, here,  mister!!! Great catch, kid. The boy runs  off. So. You wanted to see me. You usually don't work on Sunday,  Major? All in the cause of humanity,  Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one? What? One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call  you 'one'? You know what I say you are,  Helmuth? I say you're a piece of  shit. That bastard! Who's the bastard, Helmuth? Hinkel? Why? He promised to remove your  file? And what about before that? What  were you a member of in Austria? Was a member of...?  Speak up? (barely audible) I was a member of the Communist  Party. I was a communist. That's  what Hinkel had over me. He knew  everything. He held that over me.  That's how he made me co-operate. Oh, I see, he made you co-operate.  And now are you a communist again? You don't know what it's like to  wake up every single morning of  your life terrified, you don't  know that - I would never, in my wildest dreams,  have ever been a second violinist  in the Berlin Philharmonic. When  they got rid of the... the Jews in  the orchestra, it gave people like  me a chance. Helmuth, you ever heard of plea- bargaining? Talk about power, I have the power  to give you work, make your life  easier. Your past won't be  mentioned. I could give you a job  tomorrow but I have to get something  in return. See, Helmuth? That's  plea-bargaining. I can give you freedom of movement,  freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth.  But I need something in return. Major, we're discussing a man of  genius, I don't want... Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to  discuss symbols here?  This guy  was a front man. He was the piper,  but he played their tune, you get  my philosophical meaning?  I'm not  interested in small fish, I'm after  Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard  facts. The only thing I know is he's an  anti-Semite. Of course. You, too. Like everyone  else in this goddamn country. I've remembered something else... Yeah? Furtw�ngler sent Hitler a telegram  for his birthday. He did? One of your people told me. One of my people? Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew.  He said he'd seen the telegram in  the Chancellery. Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the  corporal and we'll find the  telegram. But I need documentary proof. You  know of anything like that? No. But that's why we hated him.  We admired him as a conductor but  we all hated him too because he  didn't have to join the Party and  yet he had a better life than any  of us. He didn't have to go and  deliver a report after every trip  abroad. He got everything from  them, everything. He was filthier  than any of us Party members. There's a rumour... I don't know  if it's true or not... but ask him  about von der Null. Never heard of him, who is he? Edwin von der Null. Music critic.  He gave Furtw�ngler terrible reviews  while he raved about Herbert von  Karajan. Who's he? Also a conductor. Very brilliant.  Young. Von der Null called him  'The Miracle von Karajan'.   Furtw�ngler was outraged and they  say he had von der Null conscripted  into the army. The same thing  happened to another critic. True  or not, it's not such a bad idea.   Critics give you bad reviews, you  have them sent to the Russian front. But if you really want to get  Furtw�ngler, ask him about Herbert  von Karajan. The Miracle Kid. Yes, yes you may notice that he  cannot even bring himself to utter  his name, he... he refers to him  as K. And ask him about his private life. His private life? Yes, it's all in here. His women. Where do you stand on all this? On all what? On Furtw�ngler. I don't know. You represent the United States  now. We have a moral duty to be  just and we have to be seen to be  just. Major Arnold believes he has a  moral duty, too. Our duty is to help Furtw�ngler  with his defence, That's why I want you to look at  this... These are part of the transcripts  of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't  get them translated fast enough.  But I guess you understand German,  right? That's the evidence of a guy named  Dahlerus. He's a Swede. Friend of  Hermann Goering. I want you to  study it. And I want you to use  it. We're going to find more stuff to  feed you. We'll have some other  suggestions. We need to build a  case for the defence - based not  on feelings, not on prejudice, but  on facts. Lieutenant Wills. Herr Schlee, timpanist, Herr Romer,  cello and Herr Schmidt, viola.  They are willing to help. We have  already ordered ourselves coffee.  I hope you... Yeah, of course. The whole orchestra will vouch for  him. He was always there to support  us. We need names, if possible with  addresses, because it's urgent.  Names of musicians saved by Dr.  Furtw�ngler, people he helped to  escape abroad. Let's go somewhere  public. I was in Vienna. I had with me an  Austrian chauffeur, Max his name  was, he spent time in the camps.  We were looking at these Viennese  cleaning up the bomb damage,  scavenging for rotting food, butt  ends, anything. I said, 'To think  a million of these people came out  to welcome Adolf on the day he  entered the city, a million of  'em, and now look at 'em.'  And  Max said, 'Oh, not these people,  Major. These people were all at  home hiding Jews in their attics.'  You get the point, Colonel? The  point is they're all full of shit. We're dealing with degenerates  here. That's why he didn't get the hell  out of here when he had the chance!  I put that to him, he couldn't  answer. Why didn't he go and direct  in America, like that Italian,  Toscanini. Colonel. He had no sisters, no  brothers, only a lot of love  affairs. But what... before that turns  rotten...  What if they surround  the space with barbed wire, Colonel? (dismissive) Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah,  yeah, I heard all about that. This is what I'm saying. He must  have had Party contacts. What museum? No can do. I have a duty. I'm gonna get that fucking  bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No  fucking deal. You'll see ruins, you'll see  flowers, you'll see some mighty  pretty scenery, don't let it fool  you. You are in enemy country. The  Nazi party may be gone, but Nazi  thinking, Nazi training and Nazi  trickery remain. Somewhere in this  Germany are two million ex-Nazi  officials. Out of power but still  in there and thinking, thinking  about next time. Remember that  only yesterday every business,  every profession was part of  Hitler's system. Practically every  German was part of the Nazi network.  They believed they were born to be  masters. Don't argue with them.  You are not being sent Germany as  educators. You're a soldier on  guard. You will observe their local  laws, respect their costumes and  religion and you will respect their  property rights. You will not be  friendly. You will be aloof,  watchful and suspicious. Yesterday I read that Furtw�ngler  was asked to lead the New York  Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini  suggested it. Had he accepted, he  would have become the most  celebrated conductor in America. When he met Hitler at his birthday  and shook hands with him, was he  pleased? Do you know where the Adagio begins? Put it on ready to play, and I'll  tell you when to play it. Don't talk to me like I was a second  violinist. Go back into the waiting  room. Miss Straube will come and  get you when I am ready to see  you. Jesus God, who the hell does he  think he is? Who the hell does he  think he is? Would you perhaps like to have a  glass of water, Herr Professor? Dr. Furtw�ngler!  Come in, come  in, sit down. No, no, take this one, it's more  comfortable If it's too hot, open your tie. Go ahead, be my guest. And what was that? Gee, that's a thing of beauty,  honest to God, a real thing of  beauty. I'm going to try to remember  that. Liberty, humanity and justice.  Beautiful. But you used the word  'naive'. Are you now saying you  think you were wrong? That art and  politics can't be separated? And when did you first learn that -  when you sent the telegram? Was  that the surrender signal, the  waving of the white flag? 'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love  Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect.  That sounds to me like you were  dropping on your knees and saying,  'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the  number one man. Have a swell party.' The birthday greetings you sent to  your old pal, Adolf Hider. Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe  not in your own name, but as Privy  Councillor or Vice-President. Yes, David? Why not show Dr. Furtw�ngler the  evidence. It may refresh his memory? Well, I tried, you got to admit I  tried. I thought I might just trap  you there, Wilhelm, but David here  was too quick for me. Smart move,  David, smart move. No, I don't  have the telegram, but I know it  exists. And I want you to know,  Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking  for it because I believe you sent  it. Art and politics, yeah, art and  politics. Let's look at that. You  and the Berlin Philharmonic toured  the Third Reich, played in countries  the Nazis had conquered. Are you  saying that conducting in occupied  territories from 1939 on wasn't a  commercial for Adolf and all he  stood for? You know something? You should've  written our insurance policies for  us because you got more exclusion  clauses than Double Indemnity.  What do you imagine people thought?  The Berlin Philharmonic's taken  over by Doctor Goebbels and his  Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is  a freelance, so art and politics  are now entirely separate? Is that  what you believed ordinary people  thought? No! Tell me about von der Null. Yes, von der Null. How long's this going to go on,  Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you  say von der Null, I say von der  Null, you say von der Null, we  could go on all day. You know who  von der Null is, don't you? Edwin  von der Nuell, music critic. Isn't it true that because he gave  you bad reviews and praised this  young guy, Von Karajan, called him  a goddamn miracle, said he was a  better conductor than you, then  you had von der Null conscripted  into the army and no one's heard  from him since? You sure you didn't call one of  your close buddies and say, God in  heaven, did you see what that guy  von der Null wrote about me? The  greatest conductor on earth. I  want him out the way. He had the  nerve to accuse me I am not playing  enough modern music. Send him to  Stalingrad. Isn't that what you  did? You don't like criticism, do  you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't  like them saying there was another  conductor who was better than you...  Are you saying the name von der  Null was never mentioned in your  talks with Goebbels? And what did he say? And what happened to Von der Nul? You've really no idea? I'll tell  you what happened. He died in  Stalingrad. Now, that young conductor what's  his name? That miracle kid, you know who I  mean. Von Karajan! But you called  him something else. C'mon. What  did you call von Karajan? Say it. I'll say it, then. 'Little K.' Is  that right? You couldn't even bear  to say his name! I'll tell you why. You remember we  talked about you playing for  Hitler's birthday?  And you told  me that Goebbels got to your doctors  first, that you were tricked? I have a different story to tell.  I don't think you were tricked.  Not in the way you describe. I  believe something else happened.  I've seen the Hinkel Archive, I've  seen records of phone calls, and  putting it all together, this is  what I think happened. I think  Goebbels said, 'Wilhelm, if you  won't conduct for Adolf's birthday,  we'll get the Miracle Kid, the guy  that critic, von der Null, thinks  is the greatest conductor in the  world. He's not just willing to  conduct for Adolf, he's offered to  sing "Happy Birthday" as a solo.' Come on, admit it. K worried you,  didn't he? He always worried you.  In 1942, he's thirty-four years  old, you're already fifty-six. And  Goebbels and Goering keep saying  to you, 'If you don't do it, little  K will.' Never mind art and politics  and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit  about liberty, humanity and justice  because I don't care how great you  are. It's the oldest story in the  book, The ageing Romeo jealous of the  young buck. The real reason you  didn't leave the country when you  knew you should have was that you  were frightened that, once you  were out of the way, you'd be  supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the  Party's boy twice over, flashy,  talented little K. Well, I'm just beginning to develop  my theme. Isn't that what you call  it in classical music, developing  your theme? Okay, so they played  on your insecurity. That's human,  understandable. But, there is one  guy who doesn't like little K as  much as he likes you - yeah, the  number one man your old pal, Adolf.  He thinks you're the greatest, and  when he says, I want Wilhelm for  my birthday, boy, they better go  out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls  and threatens you with little K.  And you said to hell with the Ninth  in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf  as a birthday present in Berlin.  That's the trick they played, they  got you by the balls and they  squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay?  Why did you play for them? Why  were you the flag-carrier for their  regime?  Jealousy? You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about  ordinary, everyday reasons. Which  is why I want to discuss your  private life.  How many illegitimate  children do you have? Major, I don't see how this line  of questioning could... David, what are you Counsel for  the Defence now? ( Did you hear the question? What? You like the women, don't you,  Wilhelm? Isn't it true that before every  concert you got a woman in your  dressing room and gave her the old  conductor's baton, isn't that true? Major, this is deeply offensive  and repugnant! You bet. and totally irrelevant. Not so, Counsellor. That secretary  of yours, she wasn't just your  secretary, she procured women for  you, didn't she? As many and as  often as you wanted. No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler  himself offered you a beautiful  house and a personal bomb shelter. But you see what I'm getting at?  You get a gorgeous house, you're  highly paid. What are you gonna  do, stay or leave? One voice comes  back at me: stay! Major, that's not a good argument.  If Dr. Furtw�ngler did indeed enjoy  all these... these privileges, he  enjoyed them because of who he is  and what he is. That's true of any  leading artist in any country in  the world. But it still doesn't make them  saints. They still have to get up  and piss in the middle of the night,  don't they? They can still be  vindictive and envious and mean  just like you and me. Well, just  like me. Can't they? Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go  home and think about these past  twelve years. No, that's your problem, Wilhelm.  You understand nothing. We'll call  you. Go! Major. What? Your manner. My manner? Why don't you go  downstairs, get a cup of coffee  and calm down? What's the matter,  Emmi? What's going on with you?  What's wrong? What is this, Emmi? What's not right? Emmi, stop! I want to show you  something. Let me show you something  and then if you want to leave, you  can leave, please please. His  friends, they did this. And he  gave them birthday concerts. If he had no idea, why did the  Jews need saving? This is the  question, Emmi, to all Germans:  Why did the Jews need saving in  this country? Why, if people had  no idea? Can I ask you a favour, Major? Yeah. When you question him again, could  you treat him with more respect? With more what? More what? Major, he may just be the greatest  conductor of this century and that  merits respect. David, I don't understand a thing  about you. You're a Jew. Are you a  Jew? Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think  first I'm a human being. A human being, oh, good, I'm  relieved, I thought you were going  to say you were a music lover.  This man, this great artist has  made anti-Semitic remarks like you  wouldn't believe. I got letters. Major, show me someone who hasn't  made an anti-Semitic remark and  I'll show you the gates of paradise. What is it with you, David? Where  are your feelings? Where's your  hatred, your disgust? Where's your  fucking outrage, David? Think of your parents, David, and  then think of him conducting 'Happy  Birthday, dear Adolf'. I mean, for  Chrissake, whose side are you on?  Grow up! Just grow the fuck up! I want you to come back to the  office. May I come in? If you are  there you can influence what  happens. What good can you do by  leaving. If you go, you are giving  up and how can you help Furtw�ngler  or me? Don't think about leaving.  Stay. Everybody says what a great  benefactor you were to the Jews.   But-- I have things here you said and  wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew  composer Schonberg is admired by  the Jewish International.' And  what about this: 'Jewish musicians  lack a genuine affinity with our  music.' 'Jewish musicians are good  businessmen with few scruples,  lacking roots.' You deny you said  these things? I believe that. But just answer  the question, don't give me  explanations. Major, sorry to interrupt, but  maybe we have to... maybe we have  to balance those things against  his assistance to his Jewish  colleagues. This is a transcript of the  proceedings at Nuremberg. A Swedish businessman, Birger  Dahlerus, testified in cross- examination that he had several  meetings with Hermann Goering. 'I  first saw Goering,' Dahlerus  testified, 'embroiled in a stormy  interview with Wilhelm Furtw�ngler,  the famous conductor of the Berlin  Philharmonic, who was vainly seeking  permission to keep his Jewish  concert master. Emmi, pick one of these, any one,  read it out loud. And this, only one of these letters,  Major. I have lots of them. How many times have I got to tell  you I was in insurance? You think  I can't smell a phoney policy when  it's shoved under my nose? Sure,  he helped Jews, but that was just  insurance, his cover, because all  the while he was maestro of all he  surveyed, See, Wilhelm, I think you're their  boy, their creature. You were like  an advertising slogan for them:  this is what we produce, the  greatest conductor in the world.  And you went along with it. The  truth of the matter is, Wilhelm,  you didn't need to be a member of  the Party. I made a mistake when I  asked you for your Party number. I  should've asked you for your non- Party number. Just like some other  well-known artists. Emmi, put that record on. Do you know what that is? Okay, so what is it? Who's conducting? You know the last time it was played  on these air waves? I'll tell you, then. The last time  this music was played on these air  waves was after they announced  that your pal Hitler had shot  himself. Listen to it.  They listen.   Did they pick little K's recording?  Did they pick some other conductor?  No, they picked you, and why?  Because you represented them so  beautifully. When the Devil died,  they wanted his bandleader to  conduct the funeral march. You  were everything to them. Have you ever smelled burning flesh?  I smelt it four miles away. Four  miles away, I smelt it. Have you  ever seen the gas chambers, the  crematoria? Have you seen the mounds  of rotting corpses? You talk to me  about culture, art and music? You  putting that in the scales, Wilhelm?  You setting culture, art and music  against the millions put to death  by your pals? They had orchestras  in the camps. They played Beethoven,  Wagner. The hangmen were playing  chamber music at home with their  families. I don't understand the  Germans' relationship with music.  What do you need music for? Your  pals you could call to save a few  Jews when millions of them were  being annihilated? Yes, I blame  you for not getting hanged, I blame  you for your cowardice. You strutted  and swaggered, you fucking piece  of shit, king-pin in a shithouse.  You talk to me about walking a  tightrope between exile and the  gallows, and I say to you, lies! Look around you. See the country  you served. Look at people who had  real courage, who took risks, who  risked their lives. Like Emmi's  father. Emmi, take your fingers out of  your ears! I'm talking about your father. Get him out of here. Major Arnold. Get me General  Wallace. General? Major Arnold,  about Furtw�ngler. I don't know if  we've got a case that'll stand up,  but sure as hell we can give him a  hard time. Hey, turn that down, would you?  Can't you see I'm on the phone? Never mind, we got a journalist  who'll do whatever we tell him. Turn it off! We handed Wilhelm Furtw�ngler over  to the civil authorities and he  was charged with serving the Nazi  regime, with uttering anti-Semitic  slurs, performing at an official  Nazi Party function and with being  a Prussian Privy Councillor.  Dr.  Furtw�ngler was acquitted. I didn't  nail him. But I sure winged him.  And I know I did the right thing.  Furtw�ngler resumed his career but  he was never allowed to conduct in  the United States. He died in 1954.  Little K succeeded him as head of  the Berlin Philharmonic.
