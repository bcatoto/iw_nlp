Oh. Well, thanks for the drink. No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank. Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery. Can -- Silicon Valley? So, what do you do? My name's Grant. Grant Ashby. Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks. Tough day? I wasn't sure if you'd make it. Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through -- Ten percent. Of how much? No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut. Let's just slow down for a second... What's this? I know. It won't go unnoticed. Everything looks in order. And you have this letter of intent? Sort of like a letter of intent. Big.Com. That Internet thing. I don't follow. Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back. That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off. Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate -- What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance. I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it. I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls? Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted. Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three... Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines. Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con? Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it? Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today? After you cut her loose. Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her! BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it. So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl... Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love? She had you tempting fate. Like what? You're a superstitious fucker. Nice. Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold. But there were other factors. I can see why you liked her. So how'd you get caught? In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con. Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby. Keeping the Fix happy. And these cops? What do they get? It's all about the money, isn't it? Grifters... That's not a bad place to start. Your life flashing before your eyes? Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake. No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers. Know who I am, Jake? Ten is standard, sir. We'll take care of it. So we go to the bar. Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy. The red hair... It's bad luck. People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A. Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do? Whoa. What? Come on... Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is. No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and -- What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced. Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald. Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses. The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo." Jake, I mean, come on -- Moonan. Here. Shit... Let's go, Jake? Jake... Masters of our own destiny. You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy? I'd like this cashed, please. So that's it... Jake -- Calls? You'll be there? We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over. You sure? So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk! She up for this? You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease -- Yeah... Whatever, Jake. How's that? He works for Gillette. We only owe the King a hundred and fifty. How much we going after? You gotta be kidding me. Her? When? And what about Big Al? It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin. Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River. I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric? I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop? That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick. But you won't get that splatter effect. Shit.Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep. Two million. The standard ten. Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch. You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you. You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer. There'll be red flags. This has to happen fast. We had to finalize the deal. Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little. Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore. Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan. Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay? Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com? We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22 They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course. A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part. Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan. Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing. What do you do over at your bank, Grant? Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses. It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist. What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do. We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you? Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill. Guess so. It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark. Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government. Today? Started off great... She walked. We were back on. It's not true. I was doing it for them. You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden. My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million. Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all. Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad. Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck. Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match? We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank. He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars. Factors that weren't clear to me until now. That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark. Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer. So you want to know how to play the Big Con. You never know when you can use a crooked cop. I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley. Isn't it always? We can't all be model citizens such as yourself. Just the last three weeks. Gee... What makes you say that? The Anti-Christ? And I think it's because of this redhead... What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane! Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens... That's it. What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up. We'll use the Euc. Eight A.M. flight. And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow. Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off. She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean. She's up for it. Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance... No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out. We pay better. We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need. We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King. Two million. Yes, her. Where's my wallet? Tonight. Just me. Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too. You know what we're doing with the money. Well, this is just fucking great... It can buy you a new and better you. Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back. What? I can feel you looking at me. I told you, use less powder. I think I just broke my hand. No thanks. I'm good. You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you? Excuse me? No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake. And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done. I need you to stake me. I think two million. Why? We got caught. So you know it won't happen again. No. Just confidence. I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square. Because you killed one of my crew. Let me rephrase -- I won't do that. I can't do that. I apologize for the inconvenience. You can't cheat an honest man. I guess it lacks a certain style. Minus one. I have a good crew. Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there. Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control? Something stupid. Wouldn't dream of it. Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks. Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther. Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business. That tip not work-out for you fellas? All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack. What are you talking about? Ten's standard. Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..? Very much so. Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her? My wife and I are just taking a little vacation. Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis? Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice. What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now? Help me. LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me! Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes. I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him! I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened. What do you want? An apology? You tell them the "Tale". What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right? It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it. Sorry. I didn't know... I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut. So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology? What about what? There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over. Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either. No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time. No. You trusted him... You were just getting square. Did, uh... Did you kill him? Lily... Jesus Christ... He was looking out for you. Glenn talked you out of it. You guys got busted. This is a great neck. Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me. You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now? Sounds respectable. I SAID, HOW DO -- Deal with that? How do you deal with -- Don't ruin this for me. Intuition. No. You have another part? You'll know what to do. Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would. I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it. Good quality porn has it's place in the world. Not in that repressed anger sort of way. Are you asking me if I have something to prove? It's what I do. It's my job. For what? A couple hundred bucks? Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help. What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead! But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house... You just put a mother of a jinx on us. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily. I don't trust anyone. We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can. And some new clothes. You need to get a haircut. Don't worry about it. Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here. Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something. I'll worry about Customs. Just play a part. A little acting. You get an equal cut. I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before? We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious. Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job. We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up. You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me. Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right? You interested in a little work? We're not cops. And we got rid of the red head. Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light. Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there? No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers! There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk. So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo -- But if you wanna talk about bad luck... Him. What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit. No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker. I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo? We're getting a little old for running. Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before. Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run? It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs. Good point. What? Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect... Breasts. No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill. We're working for the King. Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg. I'm getting a ride. Meet me at my place later. Just mail it to the hospital. Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you. He'll find us. We go talk to him. It's bad luck. Miles... Yeah. Stop waving that thing around. Then shut up. If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up. This is embarrassing. I know it's policy, but... The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later... I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..? Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks? A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one. You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster. You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson. Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson. And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head... HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched! Eee Oott Auught! Stand up. Egg Foo Young. Stand up. That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different. What's up with you? Bladder infection? That was fucking deep. He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this? Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here. Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck. Point, Lupus. Give us a point. My fucking heart bleeds. Of what? They're both crooks. Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet. I'll find the time. When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al. Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one. I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it. It's not history. I can handle it. The King. Can't say. A little bit of both. Huh? Oh. She's alright. Pretty much. Pretty much. Aces, Suits. Just a tip. I try. We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite? Confidence. It's just confidence. Ten percent.Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy. Come on. Harder. Come here! Come here. Feel this. Look at you, you skinny prick. I said take off your fucking shirt. Listen, Scooter -- Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead? That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up? Stake you? What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid. How much? You ask a lot of questions. Come on. Let me see 'em. I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once. Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much. Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you... Let me repeat -- Why not? Why not? Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven. You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby... Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find. You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it. Minus one. Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good? Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy. Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight. So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one? Speak. A Fed? Is he close? Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.What about... The money? What -- What do we do? Oh Jesus! I can't be here! You understand? I can't -- Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport... Sorry. What? What happened? No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m- What? You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool. Keep it up. Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit. You're a weasel. So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride. What'd he say? Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake. Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business. Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door. What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous. King ain't gonna like this. You going to have the time? I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john. He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels. I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off. Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split. What?I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in? It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake... This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard. Fuck that. We're going too. We're going to give him the money back? We sure Big Al threw him to us? You're pissed we didn't get credit? So what? We hide, right? Mob? What's a King Pin? Who's that? Jake? Customs? And we got rid of the red head. Escorts! What do we do? We change the scam? But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine! Where the hell is she? You sure? Michelle Strigo. Loan officer. Is it all fugasi? Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed. What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on. We never had a problem with that before. Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea... I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase? Uh... Why? What do we need another Shill for? Wait a second... Who's the mope? You better hurry. The police will be here any second. I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses? How do you know the King's going to let you walk? Do we want insurance? I'm just asking... Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere... Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young. I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got. You better get over to Al's. Now. You sure we're clear? My place. Your mess. Tick-tock...Sure. Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it? Attractive girl. What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend? Great. Thank you. Of course. Jake. Nice to see you. Sorry, I --Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake? Still time. Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want. So what do you want? I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame? The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all. Then who's the Banker? I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark? Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake. Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob. Can I speak to you in confidence? In over your head? Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse. You into something big?
