It's probably been about seven  minutes... Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement.  6:12. Roughly eight minutes. Number 36 this year for the Great  State of Texas. I'm going home. Let's do the press  fax tomorrow. Hey! Yo! Officer! Your seatbelt. The high court also refused to stay  Friday's execution of former  philosophy professor, David Gale. Gale had sought a review of his 1993  conviction for the rape and murder  of University of Texas colleague,  Constance Harraway. Defense lawyers had hoped to argue  that Gale's former activism against  capital punishment unduly  prejudiced... ...the Texas judicial system. Citing  'discriminating purpose' -- Hey, they're not gonna stay Gale.  It's on Court TV right now, listen. ...clear political gain in executing  its leading opponent of the death  penalty... So, what's it gonna be? Belyeu said  to call after the decision... No,  they said only Bitsey. ...Further failed to consider that  the victim was herself an abolitionist  activist... It means only Bitsey. Bill, I don't  get to make the rules, I'm a fat  black woman. ...What we need is to put her on a  plane to Houston. Why do you always get lordosis around  legal? She's here. Female ape's posture when preparing  for intercourse. Hello, Bitsey. Look, kids, setting aside the cost  issue, though half-a-million dollars  for three two hour interviews is not  only illegal it's obscen-- Market value. Guy's never talked. That aside, I, we are still  uncomfortable with the arrangement. Meaning you've just spent a very  public seven days in jail for a very  public contempt of court citation. And I, we continue to appreciate  your decision. We're just concerned.  A rapist slash murderer, five days  before he's executed, demands a  reporter known for protecting sexual  deviants. A reporter who is also a  very attractive woman -- This is disparate treatment. There's an agenda issue here which  would be diffused with an older  male... I hear lawyers gleefully saying the  words Bloom vs. News Magazine Inc. You've gotta let her go now. That's not quite what I meant. He's gotta let you go. All right. All right. Enough. The  intern is with you at all times? Yes. I, we are hanging up. 'Bye. Half-a-thumb print. Could have touched it before it was  a murder weapon. Yeah, I get very touchy around  household plastics. 'Hello, everybody --  ooooh, Tupperware.' Chill. I'm just  saying the bag could have been out  on the counter or something. Yeah. But the murder's way too fucking  clumsy. And this guy's a major  intellectual. Top of his Yale class,  a Rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two  books. He's an academic stud. Look at his wife, she's a regular  Grace Kelly. Old money svelte. Father  was Ambassador to Spain -- Ignore it. It's a rental. No. Besides the guy's a flaming  liberal. Wrong, seventy-three percent of all  serial killers vote republican. I'm not gonna fucking pollute. How far to Huntsville? 'NEWS Magazine reporters Bitsy Bloom  and Zack Stemmons entered the rest  area with car trouble... Little did they know their troubles  were just beginning. Oww! Jesus, yes. Isn't it always? So what do I do? Now what? I hope whoever it is never saw  Deliverance. You folks need some help? The non-smoking section's over there. Oh. 9:15. The waitress says the Ellis  Unit is about fifteen minutes out of  town, so we've got like five and  half hours. I -- I was thinking we should drive to  Austin, check out the crime scene.  Could be some story stuff for us. Okay, what do I watch you do for the  next five hours? You know, your reputation as Siberian- Female-Dog-Person doesn't do you  justice. So where do we report? Well, I don't rightly know one  fraternity from another. But if we  catch any those boys out here again,  we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute...  You do that, Susan... Bye now. Thank you, Margie. Correspondents Bloom and Stevens I  presume. Stemmons. Stemmons. Sorry, won't happen again.  I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C. community  relations. And these days I always like to ask,  now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.? Bitsey it is. Margie, I'm stealin'  your umbrella. Bitsey, you ever been in a prison? On death row? Well, we house 422 inmates here.  Average stay with us is nine years.  Some get commuted, move on, most get  killed. It'll put you off your supper,  but then it's supposed to. Afternoon, Earl. We've got three concerns here: safety,  safety and safety. The visitation  area is entirely secure -- we just  ask you don't touch the glass. Windex  gets expensive. Rules say seven days prior to  execution inmates must be interviewed  in a cage. This changes for no man. You're not  carryin' a weapon are you? Mr. Stemmons, you packin'? No, sir. Clarence. Karla. New York guests for  Mr. Gale. May I see your purse, ma'am. Go on and walk through. Now, should any kinda of  unpleasantness occur in the visitation  area, we ask that you stay put. Come  on through, Mr. Stemmons. And please  follow the instructions of these  fine correctional officers should  they see fit to give you any. Here you go, ma'am. Anythin' you say can be overheard. Here we are. All yours, Mr. Belyeu. You folks have safe visit now. Sit down, Gale. Hello. Hi. My lawyer respectfully suggests you  adjust the speaker-system volume. They're practicing being cruel and  unusual. I need it for Billy's appeal. Sorry. Have a seat. Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met  the summer after 4th grade, spent  the day burning ants with his dad's  magnifying glass. We called it playing  'Execution.' Since I grew up in foster homes,  he's become the only family I have. We agreed minimal contact would be  easier. Please don't mention her, or  my son. How should we start? Think. What do you fantasize about?  World peace? Thought so. Money-Fame-Ferrari? A Pulitzer? Nobel? M.T.V. Music Award? A genius hunk -- ostensibly bad but  secretly simmering with noble  passions, and willing to sleep on  the wet spot? A Victoria's Secret model -- just  slumming between law school and  running her family's Vastly Endowed  Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed  Children? Okay, good, you see Lucan's point.  Fantasies must be unrealistic. The  minute you get something, you don't,  you can't, want it anymore. To exist,  desire needs absent objects. So desire  supports itself with crazy  fantasies... Sorry. This is what Pascal means when he  says the only time we're truly happy  is when day-dreaming about future  happiness. Or why we say, 'The hunt is sweeter  than the kill' or 'Be careful what  you wish for.' Not because you'll get it, but because  you're doomed not to want it if you  do. Think about it next time you're  at a wedding. Sorry about being late. There was,  you know, a thing. There usually is, Berlin. Look, I know I'm not doing well. And to torture a cliche, I'd do  anything to pass. Anything, Professor Gale. Anything, huh? Anything. Anything? Any thing. Tell you what, I'll give you good  grade, a really good grade, if you  will... ...study. Hey. 'Yes, Virginia, the people of this  State have overwhelmingly affirmed  the reality of Santa.' Tell me again why you aren't doing  the debate. I hadn't noticed. That's not what I meant. 'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for  a woman who executed thirty eight  last year.' Anything else? I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them  to Sharon's number at the house. Apropos playing Mother. Did you mark your calendar? Yep. Only... three more Spain days. Only three. That's great, huh? What's he doing in here? Mommy said I could. Just till she  gets back. That's a special-duper monster laser  knife. Where's your laser gun? Here. Tussshh, tusssshh, tussshh. I never  shoot them in the eyes, Daddy. That's 'cause you're a special-duper- super-quadruper boy. Who's now going  to sleep. Who loves you? Ooooh. Good night, son. Do Cloud Dog. Good night, Cloud Dog. Back before midnight. Rest assured. Meinen Herren. Hello, David. Professor Gale. Where's your better  half? Spain. Again? Well, I was just off for air. Looks like Sharon's affair is an  open secret. Hermeneutical bias: the only fun  truths are the ones someone's trying  to hide. Have a seat. Listen, Berlin's here -- and livid.  Probations suspended her. She received  the letter today, took the opportunity  to throw a fit in my office. You  should -- Talking about me? Yep. He tell you I said when you were  circumcised they threw away the wrong  part. He mentioned it. It's called schmuck. What? The part of the foreskin that gets  thrown away. I think it's called  schmuck. Aren't we so fucking clever. I suppose I should get us another.  David? Black Bush. You were a jerk this afternoon. For what it's worth, I didn't know  about the suspension. Is that supposed to be an apology? More like a conciliation. All right. As the poets have mournfully sung,  Death takes the innocent young, The  screamingly funny, The rolling in  money, And those who are very well  hung. There once was a lesbian from Canjuom,  Who took a young man to her room,  And they argued all night, As to who  had the right, To do what, how, and  to whom. One more. C'mon, one more. Enough. That's enough. Do you bow to the Queen? I'm done. I'm not a student anymore. Don't think I want to know what that  means. There once was woman named Berlin,  Who liked a bit now and again. Not  now and again, But Now! And Again!  And Again! And Again! And Again! Cute, huh? Cute. I have a secret. But I have to come  over there to tell you. Here I come. I wasn't after the grade. Berlin, this, this is not... Ssshhhh. We'll just talk, analyze, contemplate.  Or... you can put your mouth on my  body. Don't reject me. Please. Rip them. What? Rip them off. No. From behind. Yes. Do it hard. Harder. Harder. Yes. Bite me. Bite my shoulder. Sorry. Yeah. And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count. Um-hum. What? I can listen and appear to listen at  the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I  left it home. Nothing. Everything. Something  profoundly stupid happened last night. It was Berlin. Constance, you're not my wife. Thank  God. I didn't mean -- Are you okay? In three, two... Welcome back to 'Batter's Box.'  Tonight we continue our very special  four-part series with the Governor  Hardin. Arguing capital punishment  with her is DeathWatch coordinator,  Professor David Gale. Governor, you're  up. Alan, let me say somethin' I always  say. And I'm gonna keep on sayin.' And  that is I hate killin.' That's why  my administration is willing to kill  to stop it. So you don't subscribe to the idea  that 'a good state is one that  protects its most despised members'? It's a nice liberal idea, but like  most nice liberal ideas, naive. It's a quote from you, Governor,  from your first state attorney  campaign. You've got me, Professor. But let  me, in my defense, give you a quote.  Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a  liberal at twenty, you've got no  heart, if you're still a liberal at  thirty, you've got no brain.' So, basically you feel, to choose  another quote, 'society must be  cleansed of elements which represent  its own death.' Well, yes. I would have to agree. Did I say that, too? No, ma'am. That was Hitler. Governor, can't we examine the  possibility that capital punishment  isn't working. That murderers aren't  deterred by the law because they  have about as much forethought as  lemmings. That it's expensive,  inequably administered, that... ...that we may even be killing  innocents. All righty, Mr. Gale, I'll play your  game. Name one. Name one innocent  man Texas has put to death in my  tenure. One. Name one in the last twenty years.  In any state in this country. Well, Mr. Gale? Dead men can't make a case. Well, as my daddy used to say: If  you can't find a problem, there  probably isn't one. Well, you certainly had me on that  Hitler quote. Thank you, Governor. These debates are awfully good for  the state, don't you think? Of course. Well, I've got to buzz. You folks keep up the good work. We  need that opposition. Look, I wanted you to do this anyway. What's that supposed to mean? Mr. Gale? Look, guys, there's not much more to  say -- Rameriz, Austin police. This is  Officer Haslinger. What, arguing with the Governor is a  crime? No, sir, rape is. Gale, time's up. Berlin had my bite marks, bruises,  ripped clothing. My skin was beneath  her nails. It didn't look like  anything but rape. Two days later  she called the D.A., said she wouldn't  testify, too drunk to be sure, etc.  On the plane home, Sharon read about  her husband's rape case being dropped. Finger authority, show she was smarter  than the powers that be. First year in here I received a card  postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't  signed, but I suspect it was from  her -- the front had the text 'Sex  is Power.' Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you  can know.' See you tomorrow, Ms. Bloom. Fucking better than watching you  work. You think he's telling the truth? Can't say that. If you say 'there is  no truth,' you're claiming it's true  that there is no truth -- it's a  logical contradiction. I, on the other hand, think Gale's  telling the truth. It's just my perspective. Thirty-three o what? Bitsey. You don't mind living here? He's not exactly a serial killer. Right. What? Where was it? Fuck, in her stomach? That's colder  than Wisconsin. What? Yeah. Same truck. Coincidences are always weird, that's  why they're coincidences. Off-the-record? Constance was murdered with what's  called the Securitat Method. You're  hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the  key, taped at the mouth, a bag's  sealed over your head and you're  left to suffocate. The Securitat did  this to Romanians who wouldn't inform  or confess. Sometimes the bag was  ripped off at the last second, you  got a second chance. If not, you die  knowing the 'key' to your freedom  was inside you the whole time. A  cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem  is I mentioned the method in an early  article. The prosecution never knew. It's more than that. There was a tripod. Not a single print was found on it.  Someone brought it, wiped it, left  it. Why? It's as if they wanted me  to know that somewhere there's a  record of what really happened that  afternoon. As if they wanted me to  die knowing the key to my freedom  was... out there. Ms. Bloom. I'm an anti-death row  activist on death row. Doesn't that  strike you as odd? No. But I have someone on it, someone  I'm hoping will one day find an  answer. A journalist. 'She's a smart one.' Wear me like a fur, Daddy! Wear me  like a fur! Who's your hero? Call me when you get to Boston? I wish you -- See ya later, Alli-gator. After awhile, Crocodile. Take it easy, Japa-ne-se. Okey-dokey, Artichokey. Okay? Well? How did Ross vote? And you? So, I wanted to get your feedback on  the idea. We aren't home. Please, tell us a  message. At the peep. I got it! I got it! Now, Mr. Gale, I want you to tell me  three personal qualities you have  that would make you a successful  Radio Shack manager. So my chances of getting partial  custody aren't good? I feel... washed. Nothing like I need you, both. You're  all I have. Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll  only prove the system works. Where'd you get those? Hey! She ever not make you work when  you come by? Mornin', David. What's her story? Constance, who did she kill? She admit to it? You're a crazy woman. Not your medium  grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's- bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose- screws-in-the-belfry insane. A real danger to flora and fauna. And how. You're burning up. Howdy, Mr. Gale. Hello, folks. Hello. My, this is service. Thank  you. Gladly. Latte on your left, partner. ...and see what kind of resources  the religious groups can deliver. Cable's good. Listen, I need to run.  For now, I agree the first press  release should focus on the woman's  youth. I'll have the Washington people look  into counsel competency, though I'm  almost sure she's exhausted this  issue on appeal. Oh, I almost forgot. He's not around,  is he? Good, keep it that way. His  relationship to DeathWatch is over,  terminated. Last thing we need is  this rape thing coming back to bite  our butts. These guys don't stay on the wagon  for very long. I'm serious, Constance. Ban him from  the premises. I realize you two... Sharon, pick up. For once just pick  up the goddamn phone! If you keep  him in Spain, I'll... I'm begging  you. He's my son! Please! Please....  Please. We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge. We fell off our wagon. Know why Saint Jude is the patron  saint of lost causes? 'Cause his  real name was Judas. There were two  Judases, Judai, the saint guy and  the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus,  and tried to kiss him. Medievalers  wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear  of getting bad Judas on the line by  mistake. Ergo, they only gave him  business when really desperate. That's  why. Then they changed his name. Constance? Your mail's blowing. How we doing? Fine. How's Constance? Sleeping. Mr. Gale, a leukemia patient's  condition is highly susceptible to  external stress. While we don't want  to totally restrict Constance's life -- What? Constance's illness requires a degree  of regularity. Constance has leukemia? Acute. She was diagnosed last fall. Have I created a problem? No, no. Gale, time's up. When I asked why she hadn't told me,  she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess  she figured as long as death was  chasing her, she could help others  escape. Constance left the world better than  she found it. It's a small, difficult thing. Fuck. Hey. You're not a happy camper. Talked to the Austin prosecutor.  Belyeu's a yokel. Prosecutor says he  fucked up the penalty phase, says  Gale probably would have gotten life  on mitigating factors. Gale stuck  with him, though, all through appeals,  despite major pro bono offers. Notta on Berlin, we pick up the money  in Houston tonight, overheat light  came on twice, and you're about to  get a surprise. Too late. This is mostly an Oklahoma caravan.  I got stuck behind them on the way  in. Execution's not for another 36 hours.  It's gonna be a zoo. There's the  P.R. guy. Fuck, look. 'Cause I couldn't see the license  plate. 6:05. Why don't you have a watch? What!? So? Maybe the maid forgot. I'll check the bathroom. Clear in here! Don't touch it! Fuck, Bitsey, there could have been  prints. She says no one asked for you. And  all the room keys are different. Just she and her husband have masters. That you have a jealous boyfriend. She didn't ask. I think she assumed  it had something to do with why he  was jealous. I still say we should  do this in my room -- this one's a  fucking crime scene. Maybe they could look for D.N.A. Try  three. You sure you want to see what's on  here? Fuck. Is it her? Belyeu says to bring the tape first  thing tomorrow. Also said you were  right about not calling the police. Are you gonna be okay? Let's say Gale's right. Some sick- fuck-Agatha Christie-wannabe set him  up, arranged like the perfect murder.  Why send a magazine journalist proof  a few hours before he's won? Doesn't  make sense. Why does he give a shit? That's a lot of hate. You're talking  beyond sadism. Then why release it? Or? The 'cat' is a fucking psychopath. Why do they call it check-book  journalism if we always pay cash? Woa, woa. Sadist at six o'clock! Yep, and doing a lousy job of hiding. He must think we're idiots. You think  he's our fucked-up feline? No. Just sitting back there. Too much mist. What the fuck does  this guy want? All here, Mr. Belyeu. He went in Belyeu's building? Fuck! How are you gonna get to Ellis? Okay, okay. Calm down. You have to  sit. Visitors need to stay seated. Sorry. Look at me. He's not your man. His  name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch  Director before Constance. He's a  'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a  good demonstration has to end in a  riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs  don't mean shit.' They fired him.  Constance kept him in the  organization, and he loved her for  it. The man adored her. He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U.  cases together, until Dusty punched  a clansman in a federal court. Benny  sometimes still gives him work,  probably had him follow you. To make sure you honored your  agreement, one for which there's no  contract. He's a lawyer, Ms. Bloom. I wasn't 'seeing' Constance. It's more complicated than that. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression,  and acceptance. Where are you? Denial's my personal favorite. Mending bridges. No regrets? Me, too. How much... how many lovers have you  had? Including college. Well, it's... not every... yeah, you  should have had more sex. I see you. Want to make it five? Finish the  hand? It wouldn't be pity. Are you okay? I'm here. Happy. I'm very happy. I'm here. It's okay. Okay. Shhh. I'm staying. It's okay. I'm inside. I'm not pulling  out. I know, I know. Shhh. I'm here. It's okay. Shhh. I'm here. I'm here. Rescued. You? Let's say they move back from Spain,  that I somehow got my one weekend a  month. Would it matter? By high  school, I'd be his weak spot, the  focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed  pride. In college there'd be late- night angst: 'What if I turn out  like the old man?' Holidays would be  forced smiles and unscheduled exits.  I mean, what girl comes home with  you if there's talk that Pops is a  rapist? I can't stand the idea of being his  model of failure. Without him, I  drink. To cover the hole. To prove  to myself he's better off without  me. Sorry, just leaving. Gale, time's up. If I could answer... we wouldn't be  having this conversation. It's why I  need you, why I chose you. You have  my story, now... 'Go.' You'll find time. You're not here to save me. You're  here to save my son's memory of his  father -- that's all I want. We live to stop death. Eating,  inventing, loving, praying, fighting,  killing -- choose a verb. All to  stall this evil, Job's 'king of  terrors.' But what do we really know  about it? Nobody comes back. There's  a point, when your mind out-lives  its obsessions, when your habits  survive your dreams, when your  losses... You wonder, maybe death is  a gift. All I know is that by this  time tomorrow, I'll be better off.  What I don't know is why. Goodbye, Bitsey. Car's on its way. Wanna wait in here? I got it. I got it. You could have  corporate sponsors. Volkswagen for  Bundy, Home Depot for Gacy. And 'The  David Gale Execution, brought to you  by...' '...Hefty.' Nine hours, 52 minutes. Any word on the writ? What? Yeah, I guess. It's a hotel room.  What -- No. Fuck, Bitsey. I'm sorry, it's  not like it's -- What the fuck's wrong with you? What? Where? It's just a patriarchal figure of  speech. Move those index cards, too. We can imagine that part. I'll position her. Towel or something. Fucking good question. Jesus, maybe she was faking, hoping  he would go away. Woa. Not a good idea. I found it. Bitsey, I'm not so sure about this. Twenty-two seconds. Thirty seconds. Fuckin' wicked. Thirty-five... Forty... Forty-five...  Fifty. Maybe she shouldn't... Fifty-five... one minute... five...  ten... one-fifteen... Fuck. Twenty... twenty-five...  thirty... This isn't cool. ...thirty-five... Fuck... one-forty...  one-forty fi... Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey. You  okay? What if I'd've waited? No more fucking experiments, all  right? Just tell me what's going on.  You okay? Maybe, all right, maybe. But why wear these? Fuckin' A, like when people hang  themselves. At the last second they  go chicken, claw at the rope and  shit. The police find their own skin  beneath their nails. Woa, chill, chill. Why not hang  yourself, or take pills. Why take  your fucking clothes off? Why make  it look like a murder? Why, Bitsey? Why fake your own murder? Motive's like a major issue here. It doesn't make sense. The woman's a  bleeding-heart abolitionist. Why  frame an innocent man? Why send Gale  to the chair for what looks -- She had to know some innocent fuck  would take the fall. Get the fuck out of here. A dead woman put the tape in your  room? Thick as thieves. Hairy. She was in love with him. Why he was fired from DeathWatch,  and the A.C.L.U. Which would only prove the system  works. So he'll wait, release the whole  tape after the execution. Hello? Let's talk about your tape... No,  meet me at the station down the hill,  in fifteen minutes. I know. Go. Go! Come on. Fucking come on. He didn't show! Fuckin' move! Took me 30 this afternoon. You've  got 26, maybe more. Here's what we know so far. Last  night, News Magazine posted on their  web site a video obtained by reporter  Bitsey Bloom... The footage appears to show Constance  Harraway commit suicide. Bloom reports she received the tape  Friday morning at a motel in  Huntsville, where she was staying  while conducting Gale's last  interview. The tape apparently had been in the  possession of a former DeathWatch  Director... ...Dustin Emil Wright. As you can  see, police and officials from the  State Attorney's office have been in  and out of his cabin all morning,  looking for clues to his whereabouts. ...a fanatic in the movement to stop  the death penalty. It appears Wright withheld the tape  to make an obscure political point  about the potential for error in  capital cases. All there? Well, it's a tragedy for all of us.  As to whether this will change policy,  the people of Texas will have to  decide. Right now, the prudent course  is to put things on hold pendin' a  procedural review, allow ourselves  time to mourn. You bet she'll review. Capital  punishment approval rates dropped 17  points. Go to the opera. Of course, the ultimate irony is  that David Gale, a man who became an  unwitting martyr, may achieve in  death what he worked for in life. Senorita Gale esta viviendo aqui? Gracias. This just came. It's over. Want me to turn this off? No. I couldn't watch. She preferred it that way. You were  right about not tellin' her the whole  plan. It helped her to think her death  would save me. You sure you want to do this? Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count. Better go ahead then.
