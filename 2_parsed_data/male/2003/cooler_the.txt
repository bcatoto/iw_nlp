Insurance? Don't you hold back, baby. Spit it  out, darlin'. C'mon... Hey! Hey,  this ain't right. S'posed to be eight  hundred dollars. Where's the goddamn  manager? Who's in charge of these  rip-off slots? Yo, ma'am... change  lady... Forget it. Hi, Natalie. Bernie. If I see Shelly, I'll let him know.  That you're looking for him. Nah, it's okay. Hey, Bernie, Shelly needs you on  eleven. Uh... Let's do the Chivas Regal.  Have that... Natalie bring it over.  The one working nickel slots next to  the Paradise. I spoke to Shelly  earlier, he wants her at the tables. Thanks. Don't mention it. I'll make you a fortune on five and  nine. C'mon forty-five-sixty-three  fifty-four! Hey, buddy, is this your drink? Back off, pal. I'm on a roll here. Seven out! Mother-fucker! Thank you for those bets, folks. Conway, party of twelve, please check  your reservation at the Paradise  Lounge. Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'... How do you do, Shelly? First off, Shelly, I want you to  know, I have nothing but respect for  you. You've done a fantastic job  with the Shangri-la for the last  sixteen years. No one would dispute  that. But, the business has changed out  here. You just have to take a look  at the Strip to see what I'm talking  about. Yes, well... there's no denying the  bottom line. Those eyesores are raking  it in. And we can't compete against  that. The numbers, they don't back you up,  Shelly. Nostalgia's grand. We all  love nostalgia -- but it belongs in  a museum. I think it's time to decide  whether you're running a museum or a  casino. I was just heading over to -- I told you, I'm not gonna be around  after Sunday. Seven days, Shelly. Seven days and  I'm out from under. Things are getting hot on fourteen.  I gotta go. ...Oh yeah, baby, give it to me. Oh  yeah, that's the spot... Do it to me  harder, you big stud... Oooooh... Thanks, dollface. It's all right. Happens. S'okay. You might want to stick  around. Excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton. You have  no hard eight. Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight. Eight the hard way! Nine hundred dollars to Mr. Pinkerton. Parlay! Parlay! C'mon. You can take that action. That's what I'm talking about. None  of this low limit bullshit. Dollar hard eight. Eight easy! Easy eight! Hard eight  comes down. Five hundred dollar hard eight. And  press my nine up two units. Easy way eight! Eight easy! Hard eight. Way to go, Pinkie! Bet the farm. Seven out! What the fuck you smiling at, bitch? Shelly. I was a goddamn embarrassment  tonight. I shouldn'a let you talk me  into going on. It's definitely strep. You get a receipt? Charmayne's in the lobby. They got  these on sale in the window. Victoria  Secret's Valentine's Collection. And  the broad waiting in the room, what  she set you back? Always Grade-A for  Ol' Buddy. Get back here, you prick. Hand it  over. Whassimatter, kid? You got that  Nostradamus look. You ever watch those nature shows on I've seen this one a dozen times.  It's about lions. Cycle of life thing.  The leader of the pack... Yeah, pride. The leader of the  pride... when he gets on in years.  It's just a matter of time before  some young male arrives on the scene  to challenge him. They go at it and  the old cat gets the crap beaten  outta him. It's humiliating. In front  of all the females, this goes down.  And after he's defeated, he's cast  out of the pride, to scavenge and  die alone in the bush. No shit. It's fucking tragic because  the old lion can't figure it out on  his own. That he's past it. It'd be  so much easier for him to just walk  away and save himself all that pain  and humiliation. Yeah. Me, too. Shelly, got a minute... Shelly, this is Johnny Capella. How ya doin', Shelly? Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz  at the Mirage. Sony's talking about  signing him to a three album deal.  They're positioning him as the new  Ricki Martin. Johnny's looking to headline. I told  him we might be interested. Hey, if this is a bad time... Sounds like the two of you need to  get on the same page. If I don't hear from you by Thursday,  I'm taking the Stardust's offer. I think I'll just stick with the  tables. No... I just know what the outcome's  going to be. The outcome won't change with me.  It'll be all bad. You had your chart done. Do you know what I do at the Shangri- la? And do you know how I do that? I do it by being myself. People get  next to me and their luck turns.  It's always been that way. I don't know about you, but I'm real  tired. I only got six more days. Well, almost  five really. Then I'll be leaving  town. I, uh... If this is... I don't know...  I don't know if I can afford... Oh god... I'm so sorry... I didn't  mean... You see -- that's exactly  what I'm talking about. I've gone  and "cooled" the damn table. I'm not here that much. Drink? Sorry,  all I got's gin. This is not my first -- Sorry... -- I did six months at Rikers for  running numbers. It was Shelly's  thing, but I took the rap for it. After I get out, I call up Shelly  and he tells me to come out here. I  figure he's going to set me up good  at the Shangri-la. But he tells me  they got all these rules about casinos  employing felons. So he gets me this  gig doing telemarketing for one of  their fronts -- trying to scam  pensioners out of their retirement  money. I lasted two weeks. Already, I was getting in deep.  Finally it got so bad, I had to beg  Shelly to take on my markers around  town. That just bought me more time  to keep losing. I put Shelly in an  awkward position. I understand why  he did what he did. Baseball bat. I got off easy. I was out of control. Let me tell you something. I'm  grateful for what he did. No kidding. Every time I get an urge  to play off the clock -- to so much  as drop a quarter in a slot -- I  reach down and squeeze what's left  of my cartilage. It's one helluva  reminder. Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a  payment plan. Two years off the books  at the Shangri-la, cooling tables.  Five more days and I walk. Mikey? Bernie... Mikey? Is that...? You're not the... Bull's eye. One time. Obviously runs  in the family. I guess you're gonna  be a grandfather, Bernie. This you? Hey, what the fuck, it runs. Anyways,  we gotta be somewhere... How's your mom doing? I'm gonna pretend like you give a  shit and tell you, she's getting by.  As long as she's wasted. Name's Charlene, in case you were  wondering. Looks like she's carrying  a whole litter in there, don't it? So, you're in town...? Maybe a week or so. Got some business  to take care of. If you want, stop by the Lucky Star  Motel. Give us a chance to catch up.  I'm on three to eleven shift at the  Shangri-la. I work the floor. No shit. Well, how 'bout that? Yeah,  maybe I'll do that. We can play catch  up. For the kid's sake. Gotta split. Thanks... Don't mention it. Hundred dollar minimum here, sir. Money plays one hundred. No offense, pal, but there's twenty  other tables. What do you wanna come  sit on my head for? Just wanna play one hand. Feeling  lucky tonight. I got this voice in  my head, says this is the table... I know this is the table. I'm already  doing good here. It's my fucking  table -- Hey, heard the one about the fella  walks into a bar and says, "Hey, who  owns that big great dane outside?" A  man at the end of the bar raises his  hand. "I do." The fella says, "Yeah?  Well, my dog just killed it." "Whaddya mean your dog just killed  my great dane? What kinda dog you  have?" The fella just shrugs and  says, "A chihuahua." "You tellin' me  your chihuahua just killed my great  dane? How?" "I dunno," the fella says, "I think  he got stuck in his throat." Insurance? God damnit! You said, one hand. Keep going. Hey, stick around, pal. You and me,  we make a great team. Is there a problem? Let me guess? This is one of your  "coolers?" Man, they told me you were a stickler  for the old ways. But coolers? What  is this guy, some kind of degenerate  gambler? Reformed card shark? He  doesn't look too effective to me. Sure. Whatever. But there ways --  subtle ways -- to keep things in our  favor. I'm talking more forward  thinking methods. As a matter of fact I do. Like, right  off the bat, I can tell you this  wallpaper isn't going to cut it.  It's too uplifting. I would go with  more muted tones. And personally, I think the waitresses  can all pop another button or two.  Myself, I wouldn't hire anything  less than a C cup. Know what this is? Music to be sure.  Pleasant, non-intrusive. But blended  in at a subsonic level is a mantra.  "Lose... lose... lose." And that's  just skimming the surface. We really  need to talk, Shelly. Shelly, you better come quick. What about the Paradise? That won't be necessary. Over here, young lady! C'mon, give  it a try. Eight for a dollar. Sorry there, sweetheart. Better luck  next time. Wanna try again? Nothing. Nothing. You're just an easy mark,  is all. Yeah. Easy mark. You never heard  that term? When we were kids, Shelly and me, we  used to work Coney Island during the  summer. When a guy would walk up and  seemed eager to open his wallet, we  would always mark him with chalk.  We'd pat him on the back or arm with  the chalk. Like, 'Hey buddy, good  job!' Meanwhile, he had no clue the other  guys saw him coming a mile away.  Easy mark. You OK? Little Joe. You know, you don't have to tell me  this. So, you wanna go try your hand at  the dime pitch? It's early still. I told the desk clerk Bernie was my  old man. He let us wait inside. That  a problem? Shit. I musta taken the last one. Tell me something, Natalie? Is he  paying you? My old man, is he renting your ass?  'Cause otherwise I just don't get  it. A loser like my pops in the  company of some primo T & A. It don't  compute. This enough to get me a taste? Family  discount? Mikey... Hey, Bernie. I told you I was gonna  stop by. Yeah... I figured you'd call ahead.  We were out at breakfast. You see, the thing is, Bernie, we're  kinda strapped. I mean, Charly here's  expecting like yesterday, and we  don't have the dough to make with  the right nutrition for her an' all.  So, I was wondering if you would  care to invest a little in your  grandchild's future... his well being. There's about three grand there.  That's all I got. You mean, Bernie. Trust me, it's a  boy. I don't think... I don't want anything  to hap... I don't know... I think so... We'll catch you later, Bernie. I  think I'm gonna take Charly over to  the hospital right now. Get her  checked up real good. Mikey... You're not going to try anything  stupid while you're in town? You mess up and they'll cut you no  slack. That's all I'm saying. You  got a kid to think about. She's perfect. Three floors of gaming,  IMAX theater, entertainment center,  boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster,  you name it. She'll pay for herself  in three years, and then it's easy  money. Yeah, we've all seen the movie. And  your point is? What are you talking about? It's  right outta the movie? Out! Seven, line away seven... Hey? I'm supposed to be next... We're coming out. Crap Eleven, any  seven. Crap, Ace Deuce. Line down. Four, hard four. The point is four. OUT! Seven! Line away. This town... You know, Natalie, all  I want to do is go some place where  I can tell day from night. Where  they got clocks on the wall. I can't  breathe around here no more. Four  days and I'm gone. I'm not even sure  I can hold out that long. A week ago, I didn't remember what  it was like to have a woman's hands  on me. I'm still pinching myself,  expecting to wake-up from... Come with me, Natalie. I want you to  come with me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring  that on you. So, what's the problem? Natalie... I can't... Not another  year. Not another week. I think... we probably shouldn't see  each other anymore. Because if I spend one more night in  your arms, I'm not going anywhere. Natalie, don't... I think you better bring me the  bottle. Please. Chang, party of fifteen, your table  is ready, Chang party of fifteen. Put this on the line for the boys. With shoes! Dealer's got shoes. Hands high, the  dice are out! The point is nine. Six the hard way! Six the hard way! Look out, we got a  shooter! Eighteen thousand since I stepped  up. I'm sorry, Shelly, I guess I've  been hit and miss lately. Seven out! Line away. I thank you. My wife thanks you. My  unborn child thanks you. Color me up will ya? You've gotta be kidding me. That's not how I propose we handle  it. We'll turn the matter over to  the authorities. They'll be  blacklisted, their credit ruined... Uh, thanks. Just lucky I guess. Shelly, stop them! Don't do this! It's got everything to do with me.  He's my son. I said, he's my -- Pop, help me... Shelly, don't you fucking do it! NO! God, no! I didn't know nothing  about it. Shelly, they didn't get away with  the money... You didn't lose  anything... Oh Jesus... Yes! All right. It's on  me. 150 G's. Shelly, please help her. That's my  grandson... Jesus NOOOOO!!! I'll make it up to you, Pop, I  swear... It's on me. What are you doing?! I thought we  had -- I did this to myself. I planted the  seed. When Angela took off with Mikey,  I didn't... I never made an effort  to get back in his life. I figured,  the kid don't need a loser for a  father. Now it's all come full circle.  I give him the money, I open the  door to all this... I musta had it  coming. Payback. It won't make any difference, Natalie.  Whatever you come clean about, I'm  not gonna feel any different about  you. I'd say the words, but with my  luck... I love you, Natalie. Trixie? Trix. You came back. Got any cre -- Lovett, party of six, your table is  ready, Lovett, party of six. Duty calls. Hey, Shelly, check it out. The new  Mega-Million. I call her Marnie,  'cause she's one frigid broad. Sure,  once in a while she'll flash you a  bit of tit, but your chances of  hitting a home run -- one in twenty  million. Here, give her a shot... I don't know... Guess I'm having an off day. Nothing's wrong. Fact is, I've never  felt better. She loves me, Shelly. She told me  last night. Natalie. Sweet Jesus... you popped her  cherries. Hi. Any of you seen Natalie around?  I'm supposed to give her a ride home. I think she left already. She wasn't  feelin' too good. We been covering  for her. Natalie? You in there? Natalie. I want you to tell me the truth,  Shelly. Did you say something to  Natalie? Did you muscle her -- This guy's all flash. No soul. I  miss Buddy. Place isn't the same  without him. You gave him an easy out? What are  you talkin' about? I thought he... Jesus... you... How can you sit here  and justify it? Like you were Dr.  Kevorkian or something? Yeah. I can't do that. I've got an  obligation to Shelly. There's no -- I can't do that, Natalie. They'd  come after me. And because you were  with me... I wouldn't want that on  me. Natalie. Did you take something? I got some  aspirin in the -- Ouch! Natalie, what happened? The mirror... Natalie. Oh Jesus... Natalie, who did this to  you? We need to call the police... What are you saying? Shelly? Shelly... We gotta get you to the hospital.  We'll talk about this later. Ssshh. Everything's gonna be fine. This is  our time. This is you and me and  we're going for it. You look in the mirror, you don't  like what you see, don't believe it.  You look in my eyes. That's the only  mirror you gonna need. Look in my  eyes, Natalie. I love you. Marry me? Yeah, I do. I have to tell him right  to his face. I will not look over my  shoulder for the rest of my life --  our lives. Don't you see, that was before you  opened your heart to me. Everything's  different now. I got lady luck on my  side. Ain't nothing gonna happen to  me. I don't think -- Whatever happens, I -- You lay another finger on her, I  swear to God I'll kill you. You hear  me? I'll fuckin' kill you! Why? Why, Shelly? He ain't never comin' back. I'm through with this joint, Shelly.  Natalie and me, we just got married.  We're outta here. I'll get a job out  there in the world. Send you half my  paycheck every month. Make good on  my obligations. I don't think so. You whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't  the world's biggest loser no more.  That honor's gonna fall upon you,  Shelly. And maybe you had it all  along. What you got? What do you got in  your life besides this joint? You got nothin', Shelly. This place --  your legacy -- it's a mirage. You  turn your back and it don't even  exist. There's no day, there's no  night, it's all just one big fuckin'  blur and it don't count for nothin'! I feel real sorry for you. Yeah, you  got this fear of germs thing. But it  goes deeper than that. You can't get  close to no one. On an emotional  level. You're the worst kind of  gambler there ever was: too scared  to put his chips on the table. Too  scared to open his heart... to extend  any real kinda friendship. Always  afraid it's gonna end out in the  desert. Well, sweet fuckin' dreams,  pal, 'cause I'm out and if that's  where it ends, that's where it ends. Change only... Check change three thousand. This a pleasure cruise, Bernie? You could say that. Well, it'll be a short one. Table's  dead. It is now, anyway. Yo Eleven! Pay the line. Winner seven! Six easy. Easy way six! Natalie... this is you... For the boys. Okay, we're coming out. Get your YO  bets, C&E, any seven... Shelly, take a look at number 4. Around three hundred thousand. We tried. You weren't picking up.  Besides, it was Bernie. Alright. We're coming out folks,  hands high... Wait! Color me up a hundred fifty thousand. And give it to him. That's what I owe you, Shelly. There  it is. We're square. Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives  up to his obligations. One hundred fifty thousand, coming  in. What's the matter with you? He's one  of ours and he's taking us to the  fucking cleaners. It smells wrong. I'm shutting him  down. He's not leaving here with a  dime -- Crap ace deuce! Line down! Call it. Twelve crap. Fifty thousand dollars! On the field? What're you fucking  nuts? Shake it, don't break it, baby! Come on sixty-six! I think I'm gonna... Bahamas, here we come, baby. Step out of the car please. What's the problem, officer? Just step out of the car, please.  Both of you. If my driving... if I was going a  little fast -- I was just over  excited, officer. See, we just had a big win at the Shangri-la -- You didn't win nothing. Get down on your knees. Both of you. He was drunk. It was just freak  luck... Lady luck, Natalie. I'm calling it.  Lady luck. And we got it as long as  we're together. They can't touch us  now. Gentlemen... I thank you for your vote of  confidence. As the Shangri-la's new  Director of Casino Operations, I'm  gonna make a personal guarantee to  each and every one of you. Your  investment in this casino will be  well looked after. The future looks  bright, gentlemen. Very, very bright.
