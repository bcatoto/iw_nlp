Good luck, kid. Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry. I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl. That would explain the indigestion. Didn't kill anything, did I? Sorry, kid. I don't do charity. Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there. Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back. Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league. I know her uncle. Friends of the family. Jesus, kid. Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat? Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives. See! The big guy likes it. Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star. Great, great. That's fantastic.You won't find a better place! No one's ever left. Why? Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate. He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you. The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow. Not yet. Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet. Bloom like a flower? Welcome to ya. What's your name?What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine! Bloom! Let's see it. You get the eye? Fine, you do it. Then do it. Or are you too scared?Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born. Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that? Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born? Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension. How would his son describe him? Thirty years. Maybe more. Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them. Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him. A pleasure. Will.Thank you. There's only one I want. A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead. I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is. I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet. Someone stole my backpack. I've got a whole backpack full of clothes! What do you mean? You don't even know me. Who is she? Where does she live? Yes! I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone. I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her. That's great. It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost. I don't expect to. This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere. I have to leave. Tonight. It truly is. No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late. The poet? What ever happened to him? What is this place? You were expecting me? Yes. Edward Bloom. I didn't know she belonged to anybody. Don. I brought it. Fine, I'm doing it. Fine, I will. I'll go in right now and get that eye. I'm sorry, Jenny. I am. And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one. Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that... I am in love with my wife. I'll... Lord, I'm sorry I... I can get it. I can just... I see. I thank you for your time. You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different. You married. I'm sorry. Have I offended you? Helping people makes me happy. It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone. In so many words, yes. I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word. Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety. How did you know? I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to. I suspect it will hurt a lot. You're pretty good at arithmetic. Eighteen. Yeah. Well, she... uh... Did you see that woman? And I like you. I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either. There was one time when I was eleven... Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why. Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication. Well, it's not a short one. Will never told you that? Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor. That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else. You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary. Spooning the sherbet. They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle. He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box. He was slipping her a little extra cream. Because see, my mother was banging the milkman. Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead. Means when you dream about something that's going to happen. Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead. I was dreaming. You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion. Just to be sure, you can take my pack. That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again. Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side. Beats me. Okay. I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this. So what do you say? Join me? Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you. You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer. What's your name, Giant? So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city. Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you? Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em. Yes. Exactly. Story of my life. The River! Let's get out of here. Like this. How I go. Tell me how it happens. The river. I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine. What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be? It would kill you, huh? You think I'm fake. I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories. What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin? Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..." What? Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth. Son? But the real story is how I got the car. You see... I think someone hasn't. Did I ever tell you about how... Oh, so you know. It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend. I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that. You know where the chemicals are? Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could... You mean, while I'm here. There's a lot you don't know about me. True story. You owe me three-fifty. And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said? There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office. Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you. I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens. She was a witch. Truly. I saw it in The Eye. People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go. You learned from the best. No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine. Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings... You -- -- are in for a surprise. Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares. Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story. Jesus Christ. What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son? You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish. I was drying out. Go out with me. I have the rest of my life to find out. I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me. They're your favorite flower. Oh. Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today... 'Fraid so. So what are you up to now? That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped. I don't believe it! I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas. You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could. Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris? Really. Wait! I need those!You're not trying to run away? You know anyone's who's taken it? What did she say? Okay. You don't like it? Karl. You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here. I can. Really?Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it. This is it? The whole vault. I'm robbing this place. I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto. It's me. Norther Winslow. I can't imagine any place better than here. This is why you don't show work in progress. There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans. I've been working on this poem for 12 years. There is no softer ground than town.No. A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish. How would you describe him? How long have you known my father? My father and I have an advantage. We never talk. Can I see him? Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you. My wife, Josephine. You become what you always were. A very big fish. And that's the way it happens. It's unbelievable. You say... Where are we headed? Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say... Okay. Okay. I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts. How what happens? The river? Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once. Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me. Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen. You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake. I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact. The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water. I'm trying to make a metaphor here. Dad! Do you know much about icebergs, Dad? Can we talk? Dad? The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it. Yes. Josephine actually went to the Congo last year. Why not religion, Dad? I thought you weren't dying. I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot. I will. I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You. Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here. You're right. When did you ever work in an office? Really. What did he say? Okay. So how does it happen? No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic. The Old Lady by the swamp. Really. You think I'm up for it? Did you do any of that? Am I? I'm not scared. The one about the witch. No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can. For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that? Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind? I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born. Make him stop. You didn't become crazy. Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young. My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two. Because he's dying. I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof. Were you and my father having an affair? How did you know my father? Are you Jenny Hill? Hello. Is he going to be okay? What happened? I need you on my side. Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy. What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing. You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place. Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy. Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman. Mmm. That's because most of it never happened. They met at Auburn. Did you? You don't have to. Probably tonight. It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo. Mom, do you want some time with Dad? I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight. So you never bought any land. Did you and Dad have any other property? Mom? Is he awake? That really happened? No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me. Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair. But I understand you, Mom. I always have. True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will. Josephine and I have a lot in common. Yes. But that's a different... How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories. You can't honestly say you know him. What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head? Mom, would you say you understand Dad? I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek. How much time does he have left? How is he? Is that Dr. Bennett's car? We rented a car. We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
