He wants you to turn, look in camera  and say the lines. That's all he said? Yes, turn to camera. Turn left or right? Right side. And with intensity. Is that everything? It seemed like  he was saying a lot more. Like an old friend, and into the  camera. Suntory Time! For relaxing times, make it Suntory  Time. Could you do it slower, and with  more intensity? Okay. For relaxing times, make it Suntory  Time. Hey- you're Bob Harris- you're  awesome, man. Yeah, I love Sunset  Odds! BOB Oh,  Ok, thanks. Man, that car chase- Yes? Oh? Yes? I don't think so. Yes? Huh?

I'll have to see about that. Can you get me on a flight Thursday  night? Yeah, they told me. Just get me out of here as soon as  you can. Oh, great. I'll talk to you later,  bye. Can you put hands close to face. Urn, I don't think so. How bout I  just hold the bottle. Thank you. We're glad to be here,  we're Sausalito. Go to sleep. Good morning. What can I get you? For relaxing times, make itï¿½ 'Suntory time'! My wife needs space, I don't know my  kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants  Tiger Woods, but they could get me,  so I'm here doing a whiskey  commercial. What about you? Why are you here? How long have you been married? Try twenty-five. I'm thinking about it. Yes... I don't know, I don't know  her anymore. I don't know if you can  be in love with one person the whole  time. I was... actually I was in  love with her sister first, when I  was twenty-one. And one day her sister  said to me she wanted to move to  Paris, so I said okay, and she said  no, she wanted to move to Paris with  Francois,   and she's still married  to him. And I moved in with Lydia...  but I always really liked Lydia. What do you do? What did you study? Oh, what do you do with that? It takes a while to figure it out.  I'm sure you will, though. Thanks.

Oh, c'mon, she's nice.  Not everyone  went to Yale. Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't  matter. I'm not, but do you have to point  out how stupid everyone is. We should get going. OK, I'll see you later. You have eighteen new messages. Press - Hi Charlotte, I don't know if you're  in town... but I'm having a birthday  party for my dog, Louise, tomorrow  night, at my house around eight... Charlotte hangs up Good...I'm tired. I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink  downstairs. She wants to talk about  some photo thing. You wanna come? Ok. Where? Oh, that's too bad. How crazy is this shit? Who do I have to fuck to get off  this planet? No, what are you talking about. That's ok. That's ok, you'll figure it out. What? I got some hair stuff. I gotta go to work. I'll be right down...I'm just  leaving...ok. See you later. At the fitting, they had all these  rock n roll clothes, the label guys  kept saying lock n loll, though, but  the band doesn't look tough at  all...they look better just skinny  and nerdy, like how when they came  in...they looked so uncomfortable in  these Keith Richards clothes, they  should just be like they are, don't  you think? Yeah, I think you're probably right...  because when you try to... I don't know. Will you please stop smoking? Its bad for you. A Soul's Search: Finding Your True  Character and calling? Is this yours? You don't have to be embarrassed. It's ok if you are. Oh, the record company sent these... I gotta go... and I don't really  like champagne. Are you sure you want to stay? Ok, definitely call them, I'll be  back Friday. I love you. It'll just be a few days. Hi. Did you have a nice swim? No, how about you? I'm here for the week. Ok. I know, it's stupid.

I don't either. Lydia? Lydia, I went to this great house  tonight, this guy designed and built,  you would have loved it. He was this fashion guy, and there  were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was  talking to these Japanese surfers...   He was playing all this great music-  I have to find out what it was... Yeah, its really different here. It's four in the morning... I'm going  to go to sleep. I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning . Hello? Charlotte, who? Of course. Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and  I'll meet you downstairs. I see them every morning. Hans was very attentive to you. No, its easy. I don't know. But the first time I saw you was in  the elevator. Yeah, you don't remember? No, you smiled. I know, I kind of blend in here. I don't know. My fax said "have a  good fright". Ok, whatever you want. No, I was looking at you. I got a fax today from your friend  Hiromix. No, for a candlelight dinner, yes,  for her show. You're possessive. No, yes, it does... Thanks. It does, the more you know  who you are... you don't care about  things the same way... You'll figure it out. I'm not worried  about you. Keep writing. That's ok. It's hard. We started going to a  marriage counselor. We established that we have no  communication. We used to have fun, she used to  like to go to places with me for my  movies and we would laugh at all the  weirdos, but now she's tired of it  all. She never wants to leave the  kids, she doesn't need me, and they  don't need me, I feel like I'm in  the way. It gets complicated when  you have kids... that changes  everything. When they're born its like Vietnam.  It's terrifying. But, it's great being with them,  after they can talk, and can do things  with you. Where'd you grow up? I know. You are. Because that would be too easy. Hello? Mr. Harris, we have fax for you! Ok. Do you want I send it to your room? Great. Thank you, Mr. Harris. Miss Kawasaki? It's Bob Harris...  I'm not going to be able to do that  interview today.., yeah... ok....  Yes, I'd love to stay to be on his  talk show... sure.. ok... bye. They really have to work on that  street name thing. It's for my daughter. Four. Nice one. What happened to your toe? That doesn't look good. We should get you to the doctor. Yeah, look at that thing. How do you say "hospital" in Japanese? Excuse me? Hospital? One moment, please. Concierge desk, may I help you? Yes, can you tell me how to say  "hospital" in Japanese? "Hospital" in Japanese? Hosupitari. Hosupitari? Hello? Oh, hi, Elaine. Ok. Yeah, I'll stay. Hello? Hi, Lydia. Uh, no. Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost. That's not what I'm talking about. I don't know. I don't know... I want to be more  healthy. I want to eat better. You know, eat healthier. Not all that pasta. Like Japanese food. Oh, come on. Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye. Where's your husband? Do you ever see him? Do you know where we are? We hear you're quite a golfer. I enjoy the sport. They now have the competition for  you with the Iron Chef. Yes, but no, I can't right now. I don't want to be. Hello? Hello? I couldn't hear you. How are you? It's ok. What? Yeah. That's ok. Tomorrow. Ok. Bye. No, we'll find something around here. You're a brat, wasn't there anyone  else around to lavish you with  attention? We'll have two of these. What do you want to drink? So, where'd you go today. I'm sorry. Tomorrow. That's what you said the other night. Good Evening. I'm Carl West, and  we're thrilled to be joining you  this week, here at the NY bar in  Shinjuku. Jt seems we stood and talked like   this before,   we looked at  each  other in  the same way thenr   but   I cant remember where or when... I don't want to go back tomorrow. Why can't it last? Somethings  that happen for the first  time,   seem to be happening again  and so it  seems we have met before,    and laughed before,   and loved  before,   but who knows where or  when... Hello? Yes? Hello, can I have room 5601. One moment. I will connect you. Uh...Hi, Charlotte... it's me, Bob...  ok, I guess you're not there... wanted  to say good-bye... Charlotte?
