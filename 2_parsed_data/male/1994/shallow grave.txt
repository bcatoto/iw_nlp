I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea. Where do you think you'll go? About the mail -- Yeah? Not at all. Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best. It's all right. I'll forward your mail. So I gathered. Yeah, I was phoning your mother. They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff. They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good -- I beg your pardon? It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all. I don't know what you're talking about. Who? We just wanted to speak to you. Looking for you? Yes. Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it? Not eating like you used to, that's what. You're not eating. What's wrong? You're sure? There's lots more. Oh, that'll come in useful. What's all this for, more security? No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me. Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six. What is this? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there. Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around? After. After you drink to love and happiness forever. What's the problem? Just stop worrying. Not now. I have an idea. That was good. Yes. Now come on, all or nothing. Don't you worry about that. But not quite. Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't. Take his legs. Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David. You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer. I don't hear this. We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough? Do I? What? What? What are you talking about? Then what? Who's going to do what? Dig the pit, I don't know. A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit. Now what else? DAVID I don't know. You call them if you want. He couldn't get his car started. All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it. But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough. I'm only asking you both to think about it. Juliet? Come on, David. Think about it. Can I show you something? Yes or no, yes or no, yes or -- Have you seen him? No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work. It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper... Why, thank you, David. I'm only asking what you think. About this guy, this Hugo person. What do you think? You learn that in your psychotherapy group? I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win. You're a bad loser. Chess. Chess is often used as well. In the same fashion as chess. I was trying to educate you. Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination. With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe? Or maybe just phone out for a pizza? I'd like to ask you about your hobbies. What's his name? Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'? I don't know. But there's no -- Cover it? I don't know anything about it. Right. What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see. Yes. Oh, no problems. Don't worry. That's all? Parked outside? Well, is it? Yes, I suppose so. I don't know them. I've never seen any of these men before. No. Why should it? It looks like he's writing everything down. Are you recording it? Is this being recorded? Nothing. We thought you were someone else. So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you? Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap. Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think? And you like it? Good. Well, you've seen the flat? Well, Cameron, are you comfortable? What? Let him go. Let him take it all. No. Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type. The perfect couple, I should say. That's what I thought he said. Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed -- I don't know. I thought maybe I was -- Are you all right? What? Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood. And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything? You'll wait in the hall? No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up. I refuse. No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further. Well, I'm not expecting anyone either. Oh. Expecting anyone? Now you thought of that, not me. We could put it somewhere. He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe. He won't do anything for me, but for you -- Exactly. Now I've been thinking -- Later. But first -- him. We have to talk. Boy, am I glad to see you. Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it. Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that? He can't stay up there. Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing -- You know we're right. Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it. You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice. It tastes different. No, no, it's different. Will you calm down. No. Who was it? You were magnificent. Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo! What's he doing here? Cameron. You remember Cameron. Look over there. It's Cameron. It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever. Love and happiness for ever. I want my money back. Excuse me. I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge. Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me? David? Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing. And now you tell me. But you're a doctor. You kill people every day. I thought we all were. Is that all? What? Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet. It's not every day I find a story in my own flat. Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from? Don't look? I'm just looking. What? What's wrong? I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think? I wonder how he did it? All right. No problem. Now? You want me to kick it open? So? Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again. I will ask you once more, what sort of car -- What sort of car? He's got a car? Hugo. Maybe he didn't like us. David hasn't seen him either. No. Any idea which channel he's on? You see, they don't really know me. I think you're lying. Know and love? A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet. -- which is a hack. What I am. It was you, Juliet, it was you -- I'm not usually drunk. He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't. Aroused and inflamed. What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --' I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion. Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things. -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she? Well, she had problems -- No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry. For my life? At a discussion group? I think not. God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing. Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that. Did you know -- And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'? When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear? When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire? Really? Cameron? Can you afford this place? Well, that's what I said, isn't it? It's OK. There's no problem. What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right? What? So, uh... Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see. Interesting.What? Well, yes. Yes. Oh, yes, it's great. Yes. Yes, thanks. That's right.Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago. What? Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet? It's very kind of you to offer, but -- No, can't think of anything else that matters. But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet? I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times? For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer. No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally. Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving. Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard. Except the money. They know. But they know. I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better. It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen. Your friends. What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it? You looking for me? I want to secure it. If you give me the plate, I'll eat. Not eating what? Nothing. No, I'm sure, that'll be enough. What? Yes, that's fine. I fitted a lock up there. On the inside. Doesn't it worry you? There was a break-in. From what? Jehovah's Witnesses? Security. How much? How much did you pay? How much did you pay? You think so? Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this -- Now. I want to talk now. Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do -- Can we talk about something? Is this necessary? Is that going to be deep enough? Finished. I don't know. I just thought we should discuss it. I'm just telling you I can't cut him up. I won't be able to. I can't do it. You know what. Who's going to do it. You know what I'm talking about. No, not that. So who's going to do it? And what about you? When are you going to let the police know? He's still here. You think so? It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick. You mean immoral. No. No. No. I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time. No. Alex, I don't have the time -- Only on expenses. He made it clear. I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak. I don't have time. About what? Discussion group, Alex, discussion. Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges. I haven't lost yet. Will you shut up and play. What? Just serve. Serve. Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing? Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time? All right, just a few questions. I don't know -- Campbell or something? Yes. No, I've never seen them. Yeah, that's right, that's it. Someone lost the key. I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper. No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up. I see. Yes, absolutely. No, three. Who said there were four? Who said there were four? There are only two other people in the flat. Of course. No, nothing, sorry. No, not that I recall, I was asleep. So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think. Of course. Burglary? What about? Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that. But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him. That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket. Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio. And you need your sleep. You and me? We already know. All about it. I'm sorry. I thought you'd gone to work. If I think you're lying -- Who have you talked to? Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to? Were you expecting anyone? Tonight? Expecting anyone? No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet. You paid two hundred pounds for this? Two hundred pounds? That was stressful. I found that stressful. I'm sorry. Do you know many of these people? No. Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine. I've never seen a dead body before. Is this what they always look like? Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now. Did you ever kill a man? OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band. Do you smoke? Oh, I see, I thought you meant -- I'm boring? Yes, sir. I'm not sure -- Eh -- Not any real sneering as such, no. Exactly what I was -- Well, it's a wide range of, eh -- Right here? Sorry?That's what I thought. Yeah, here, I mean, where else? That one, last week. That guy, the one that died. What happened to that guy?Don't know what? Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short. Well? Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it. Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.Yeah. You mean I can have the room? You were going to say something. What? I see. No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self. I write about it? The human condition. For what? And he's a patient of yours? Working nights? Shall I answer it? A little bit. Is that good or bad? It was some guy called Brian. All right. The telephone? It continues to ring. It's a breeze. Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already. Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it. A priest who dies. Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel. It's nice. I'd be delighted. You must be Juliet.Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like. I see. Just one thing. Sorry to waste your time. That's it, then. No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you. What? And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you? Take another look at these two. Well, then? That's because he is. Does that upset you? What does it look like? This is just an informal discussion. That wasn't a question. You're sure of that. Is this where no one stays? Loks like you had a break-in up here as well. Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't? I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything? Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using? How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure? We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four. Two? And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything? Well, if you do, you'll let us know? Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days? did you hear anything before he cries? Can we come in? Downstairs. It's about the burglary. Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions. And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate. I mean, that's what it's like. Like recognizing criminals by their crimes. And what do you recognize, names or faces? But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No? Do you think you have a good memory for faces? Look again if you like. Take all the time you like, doctor. Or a fake? Your watch. One other thing. Do you have any tattoos? It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes. Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.Is it real? You can tell by the intonation. Offering it for debate. Both, sir.Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying? It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot is variable. Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you. Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important? October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
