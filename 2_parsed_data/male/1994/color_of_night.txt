So who do you think is the enemy ?... No, no, give me a specific answer... The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New-  OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and swoop down to finish me off.  Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it.  Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have to fill in the blanks. We invent things.  You invent enemies to test your strength against. You invent gods to protect you from these enemies.  Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ?  Take a look in the mirror, Michelle  Any mirror. Tell me what you see.  All right, get back there... Stay back !... Get back in your car... Stop it...  My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared...  Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from Hell. And then the red started to fade away.  Poor Capa ! You're here for me to pity you.  Hell, yes. It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to figure out I don't care to see the color of my patients' blood.  I'm a little surprised that this happened to you.  Starts to stand up. Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a bitch.  Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here. Do you really believe that you're responsible for her illness. You were a small recent part of her life.  Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that easily.  Well, you always were a romantic. Are you involved with anyone else ?  No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of them want to love me  Maybe you don't want to be loved. You had a happy marriage once.  She loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody else to death.  Of course, there is something else here. To deny red is to deny emotion.  Oh yeah !  As you know, that could be very dangerous.  Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get fixed.  You're a pretty good therapist. How long does it take a man like you to forgive himself.  I see you when I get back from Los Angeles.  Don't run away because of one treatment failure.  I'm not running away, Larry, it's just a little trip to Los Angeles. Besides, you can't really run away. It's all up here, isn't it... Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me.  Hey ! Jerk-off ! What are you looking at ! There's an accident !... ... Hey ! What happened ? Anybody is hurt ? Anybody is dead ? What are you doing ? You 're looking there and driving here ? Put the pedal on the metal... Asshole !  33 and 3 is... 44... 45   38... 14...  33...  2...  13...  3...  29... 304...  Leave him alone, will you ?   Clark !  8...  Clark !  Yeah !  Did you read the paper to-day ?  No !  I was just wondering how many fucking pages it had !  Oh Christ ! I fell right into that !  16...  4... 47...  I care that he is late.  I don't get it.  I don't care.  Because his father's paying for his therapy.  Unbelievable !...  I think we should get started now... Clark...  Hey Bob !  God ! Bill !  How you doing ? You look great.  I'm good...  OK...  I' sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic on the freeway.  Listen... We're just about to get started.  You know. I'll just wait out here for a while.  Why don't you join us ?  Oh no... Listen... I's the last thing I need right now...  I'm serious... I could use a second look.  No, Bob... Not tonight...  This is my friend, and colleague, Bill Capa, from New-York. Why don't you sit down over there, Bill... ... I thought it might be interesting for you, and for him, if he sat in one of our session.  What kind of a shrink are you ?  I'm a behaviorist.  Qualifications ?  Same as Bob. We went to college together. We fought the battle at Penn State Mental Hospital, as interns...  No one is gonna be offended if you want to say no.  No, Bob !  Fine, thank you, Sondra.  Medical degree ?  No. I'm a psychologist and a psycho-analyst, not a psychiatrist. The Ph.D. is from N.Y.U.  OK ! Thank you...  So, it's Bill and Bob, therapy "à deux" !  Why don't we begin by introducing ourselves and then saying as much or as little about why we are here as we are confortable with...  Name's Buck.  That's an anti-gender remark  Sondra ! Sondra, whey don't you start us off ?  Thank you.   Richie !...  This will be an event  Richie !  Richie !  What !  Would you like to tell Bill a little something about yourself ?  No !  OK... If nobody else is going to do it, I will. Richie has a gender identity problem, and social phobia, and he's promised the group no to wear the walkman in this group.  Doctor Clark, to lay the inventory on. I like that.  Oh, Saint Christopher rattles his chain.  Saint Michael, sir.  This is not about you.  You're right...  You know what I am saying ?...  I... I... I op... open my mouth to talk, but nothing... happens... except when I... when I do drugs. I... I can't... can't talk... so that's... how come I'm here... They... they say that I... I... that I blush too.  Y-You c... can say that again...  Fuck you !... Fuck you !... I'll tear your fuckin' head off ! You fuckin' cocksucker !  Get up!  Get the fuck off me !  Buck.  It's all right... He'll come back...  What do you think, Doctor Clark ?...  Was it something I said ?  You know, guys... A little humanity...  Funny... Oh, fucking laugh !...We're entertaining the shit out of you, aren't we ?  Would you stop wound-licking, Sondra.  Buck ?  I lost my wife... and daughter... And it just can't seem to pass... All right ?  Very sorry. How did they die ?  They say... ... I... I can't talk about it...  Casey ?  I am Casey Heinz. I am a painter. I live in a loft downtown, and I guess... you could say... I'm alienated...  Does a bear poop in the woods ? I sit next to Clark  And then smoke up a storm. My name is Clark. I'm a lawyer. And I... I have a compulsive obsessive disorder.  So what's the problem ?  The problem is that if you and Buck are going to smoke in here, then the door to Doctor Moore's office must remain opened in minimum of fifteen inches.  And I would also like to suggest that you buy one of those ashtrays...  ... that sucks up the smoke and purifies it. They cost nine dollars and ninety-nine cents, half of which is four- ninety-nine point five.   One of you will have to pay an extra penny, but I'm sure you can work that out.  He's going to open the door.  I'm going to open the door.  You know, if you don't act more seriously in groups.  He's back.  He's back.  Next time you get snot on the doorknob...  Bill... What would you like to tell us about yourself ?  Well... I have plenty of problems... the biggest of which right now is jet-lag. So I think I'll pass for now, Bob.  Fair enough...  Well, that's all for tonight. I'll see you all next week...  Way to go.  Bill... I'll be with you in a couple of minutes.  Coffee, anyone?  Yeah.  Nine.  Have you read Bob's book ?  No, I haven't.  It's really... it's quite excellent.  "Way to go"... I'm glad to hear you liked it.  Very much. Good night, Doctor Capa.  Good night.  Alone at last !...  Are you OK ?  Well, nobody jumped out of the window. So maybe I am making progress...  You want to get a drink ?  Hu-hu !  You want to get laid ?  No !  So what do you think of my little group ?  What's Buck's story ?  You mean, how did he loose his wife and kid. I don't know yet. He's not talking yet... Either !  How about Casey ?  You tell me !  Well... I smell money... Lots of it... Maybe an abusive father... How am I doing so far ?  A Plus !  Daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown, and the very expensive artistic life style, as long a junior stays in therapy.  You got the hair on the back of my neck standing up !  Yes, I'm a psychic when it comes to masochists. Five'll get you ten he likes to whack now and then.  Where did you get that from ?  I was born with it. Like a tuning fork.  What about Richie ?  Genuine nut-case.  Dangerous ?  Volatile ! Don't fuck with a trapped rat !  Oh, I see. "Trapped rat" syndrome with a recommendation of a "Non fuck with" therapy ! Well, can I quote you on that ?  Yes, you may. Takes notes, there'll be a pop-quiz later !...  OK, I'm ready.  All right, if I diagnose a schizophrenia, what do you recommend ?  Don't fuck with it !  Now, you got it.  It's all one place ?... Goddamn... Like peeking through a keyhole... You get a very limited... view of the truth....  What's that ?  "Way to go" must have gone really well !  Yeah !  After you, wise guy... Come on.  Oh, men... So, how are we as we approach forty ?  We are in a good shape. Really good shape. We finally got divorced. We have some money... ... We're meticulous.  I don't detect a woman's touch.  We have a little friend... You'll meet her.  She's too young for you.  Ohh !  Always get the clichés and you won't be disappointed.  This woman is not a cliché.  Thanks... Good to see you, Bob !  You too !... So... You're ready yet ?  Ready to what ? So hard to talk about... So hard to talk about... I's just a game... dumb, deceitful game. So I quit my practice.  Lost you religion, huh ?  Well, I certainly lost my belief in the scriptures.  I'm sorry, buddy. You gonna be in a lot of pain.  There is a distinctive absence of pain. I... I cannot feel the pain that I know that I'm supposed to be feeling right now. And I think I'm going crazy... I'm lost, man, I think I'm going crazy.  You may be... Your mind may be shot...  ... but I hope your body isn't.  Do I get to warm up ?  Yeah !... Two mile any pace you like. And then... ... let's do ten.  Ten ?  Too much for you, huh ?  I dunno... I was thinking of maybe twenty. They are now on a minor dirt road. We can see Bob's house in the  Gees ! Billy ! You'll never change... Why don't we just drop our pants to see who's got the bigger dick, and then we can go back and have a nice civilized breakfast ?  Wouldn't be civilized...  Why ?  You'll be sulking !  You don't have hills in New-York... Hang on a second... Hang on a second... Hang on a second...  What ?  What was that ?... What the hell was that ?...  What are you afraid of ?  I got a gear slip, here somewhere...  That's not what I meant... What with the security systems, the security gates, looking over your shoulder.  I've been getting some threats.  What do you mean ?... Death threats ?  Pretty sure it's somebody in the Monday night group, I just don't know who...  Monday night as in last night ?  Yeah !... I was hoping that maybe with your tuning fork that you might have a hunch.  No... No hunch, Bob. What make you think it's somebody in the group ?  Only about a dozen things... I's been going on for a couple of months now. It's funny how it gets you after a while.  Call the cops ?...  Yeah ! They say if they had to protect every shrink in L.A., they'll need an army ! But that I should call them if anything happened.  That makes sense.  Yeah ! Probably, it'll just blow over.  Yeah !  How about you ?  About me... what ? What would you give a suicidal patient that's got everything ?  Parachute, I heard it already.  Out here already, huh ?  Come on, old timer !...  Oh, shit ! You may have to... You may have to carry me in.  You know you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to...  Yeah ! Well, you know... Practice and all... Hey ! How about that : "Learning to loose" by Doctor Bill Capa !  Got a ring to it !  They are making those seats smaller, huh ? Whoo !  See you next week. All right ?  That'll be great, Barbara.  Barbara ?...  No... Nooooo !... Why ?  Man, I didn't do nothing. Oh, please... You know, you're very cute. I love you.  You're Capa ?  Yes, I'm Doctor Capa.  You're here because of the dead doctor ?  Yes...  I read something about sessions on Mondays. Tell me about this Monday group.  There's five patients in the group. I Can't really remember their names right now.  Like five cuckoos.  No. Four neurotics of varying degrees and one killer. At least, that's what Bob thought.  Bob Moore ?  Good. Yes, Bob Moore.  Four men and one woman.  Right.  And you sat in one of these sessions, right ?  Yes, I did.  So, who did it ? Hey-hey-hey-hey... ! Anderson ! This is civilization, man. What do think this is ?... Your bedroom ?... Damn... Knock... Knock... Don't... don't come into my office like that, bro. Hey ! It's third world thing !... Where were we ?...  You were probing me about the patients. And I was about to tell you that I really can't help you at all. I don't really know any of these people.  But you're a professional like me. You gotta have some kind of suspicion.  I really don't have a clue. I'd like to help you, but even if I could, there is an issue of confidentiality.  Confidentiality ?...  Yes.  You're talking to me about an issue of confidentiality.  Similar to the Miranda oath.  If a friend of mine got killed, and the only thing between the killer and me was Miranda, you know what I will do ?... Huh ?... Fuck Miranda up the ass. But don't tell anybody, because it's a matter of confidentiality... Shhh !...  Oh, look ! I'm sorry I can't help you. I've only been in Los Angeles four days.  You're sleeping at that... dead guy's house, aren't you ?  Yes.  Maybe something will come to you in the night, you know, like dreams and shit. But... what happens to patients in a situation like this ?  Usually a colleague will offer to take over the group... continue the treatment.  How sweet !... How sweet !... It's like one of the vultures dies and then the others step in line and eat his portion. Is that what you're planning ?  No.  Why not ?  Because I really can't handle that right now.  Sure you can !... Come on !... You've been a week in L.A. and you already have you own private screwing farm. How bad can that be ?... That's a great career move.... Where were you at the time of the killing, Capa ?  I was at his house, Bob's house.  You had to think about that ?  Jesus Christ !... Are you going to arrest me, Lieutenant Martinez ?  Hey ! You want a lawyer ?  Do I need a lawyer ?  You're in L.A. Everybody needs a lawyer. All right !... You can go home now, take a shower. And keep your mouth shut. The only thing that I got going for me is that few people know what happened, and I don't want the press fucking things up.  All right !... All right !... Hold on !  Oh shit !  Capa !... Capa !... Are you there ?  Yeah...  How is it going ?  What do you want ?  I brought the victim's car back and I got to search the house.  You got a search warrant ?  What is it with you ? Don't you want me to find out who killed your friend ?... No, I don't have a warrant.  All right... Come on in...  Open the gate.  Yeah... Right... How's that ?  You got the sprinklers on !  How about that ?  Jill... his wife... his ex-wife...  Nice bush !  I'll tell you said so... I'm sure it will mean a lot to her...  Check this fucking bed ! Damn !... Everybody is having fun but me, goddammit !  I do not like guns.  You prefer knives ?  I need you to do me a favor.  What's that ?  I want you to tell the group about Moore's death.  Me ?...  Yes.  Why ?  Well, maybe one of them won't come in, or maybe they will all come in, but then you would be able to spot something wrong.  I just can't handle it right now... OK ?...  I just had all the mess in his office cleaned up. Don't you want to help me find the killer ? Have a heart.  What does that mean?  If you don't tell them, I'll have to tell them. Am I the person to break the news to these people ? « Listen up, you fucking daffodils, your shrink is dead. Which means that all the time, effort and love you put in this relationship is wasted. You've got to remain as fucked up as you are or get worse. »  You are one sinister piece of work. All right, I'll do it.  It's better if you do it.  No, you listen to me. You don't understand, Gene. Don't lie, just give the family what it wants... No... No, you don't understand. I have to call you back. Christ ! Hey !... You're right ?... Hey !...  Hi, Rose !... I't nice to run into me like this !... I'm Bill Capa...  Got a pen ?  I just moved here... From New York... I wrote my address down, because I am not sure about this number, and how long I gonna be there, so maybe you can call me sometimes for the next couple of days.  Bye !  You could lie.  Hi !... Who hasn't arrived yet ?  Sondra... Where's Bob ?  Wha... What's wrong ?  If it's all right, I'd rather wait till you're all here. She's always this late ?  Depends on who is banging her...  Was class was that, Sondra ? Advanced cunnilingus for the single woman, or a CPR for pleasure and game ?  Christ, don't excite her !...  There's something I want to tell you.  What ?  Shhhh !...  You should prepare yourself for bad news...  Bob's been killed.  What are you saying ?... What are you telling me ?  He was murdered.  Sondra !...  He was locking up here late Friday night.  Yes, right here in the office.  Was he shot... stabbed... beaten ?... Have they got a suspect... a motive ? Three days go by, and you don't call us.  It was easier if you were here together.  Oh, I see. So, even Bob's death is group therapy. That's great. Hey, Bob, thanks for giving us a chance to grieve together. Shit !...  What the fuck is going on here ? I need to know more.  He was stabbed to death.  How many times was he stabbed ?  Sondra... Sondra... Sondra... Sondra...  It's OK... It's OK !  It doesn't make sense to me...  Many times, Clark... More than thirty... It's all I can tell you...  It wasn't a thief, I can tell you that right now.  I agree.  I mean, why stab a guy thirty times ?... Bob !... He'd piss in his pants if you showed him a knife, you know that...  I'm saying, Sondra, that you really, really have to hate a person to stab him that many times. You're a shrink, right ? You know what kind of power people hand over a shrink. Or maybe sometimes, they hand even more than they want to.  That is absolutely correct... A thief would not stick around and stab someone thirty times.  Since when did you become such an expert on robbery ?  What... what are we gonna do now ? I mean u...us, th...the group ?  I bet Doctor Capa has an idea...  What does he mean ?  I think Casey is suggesting that I... may have some plans to replace Bob...  No... I can't do that... Not right now...  One reason is that I am more screwed up than you people are.  I was just being obnoxious, and loud before. Anybody has a fucking Xanax ?  Stop with the drugs.  It would be a good idea if you stayed.  Bob isn't cold yet ?  I mean, there'll be some connections. Right ?...  I know what kind of force a group can become in your life... You tell things here... intimate things that... you wouldn't tell your best friend. I'm very flattered that you would... But the truth is : You are the people that make this work. I would be more than happy to try to find someone for you to continue this, but I cannot help you.  If my opinion counts for anything, I would like to ask : why it is you feel so inadequate for the task.  Maybe he just don't like us.  No, that's not it, Buck.  Why don't you step on something?  You stop.  Six weeks ago, I spoke harshly to a patient. And she committed suicide... Right in front of me. Perhaps she would have done this, anyway. That's what my colleagues say... But I don't know...  And my patient... Her name was Michelle... She jumped out... of a window in my office... Ohh... So much blood... And so red... And in right time, before my eyes... the red just disappeared... it's turned to grey... So I don't see... red now... Then I failed... so I can't help you... I don't think that you want someone like me around right now...  I think I do.  M... me too.  Why don't you give us a try for a month.  Listen, if you need anything, any free legal advice, to help you wrap up Bob's affair, please don't hesitate to call me. I'm not with anyone right now. I'll be more than happy to help you in anyway.  Thank you.  You bring me a confession ?  No.  Well, you win some, you lose some, right Capa ?  Listen, maybe it was not one of the group  Oh no... he's beginning to like them already. Your friend Bob Moore deserves a lot more loyalty than this.  Hey... Why... Why are we staying here shouting at each other for ? What's this place ?  I used to work in narcotics. They used to come here a lot. I probably fucked and, or arrested half of these people's parents. It's a nice place. I like it.  Makes sense. Look, I'm sorry I haven't got anything for you. I'll see you around.  So, that's it, hey ?  Yeah.  Anything you want to tell me ?...    So you better shut the group down.  Who say I hadn't ?  Oh, have you or haven't you ?  They ask me to take over the group. I couldn't say no.  Ha ! Ha !... I figured... You're gonna do real well in this town. Shut the fucker down.  Stop. You sent me over there.  No, I send you there to convey a piece of bad news... Will you give me a break, will you, man !... I didn't send you there to go trolling for business.  Come on !  You told me you couldn't handle it.  Well, it turns out that I handle it now.  You stick you dick in a barrel full of barracudas once. Maybe you won't lose it. You leave it in there, it's gonna get shewed up at the root.  I appreciate your concern for my dick, Hector, thank you.  I am being really nice, full of concern for your safety, in case it's one of them, hey ? Shut it down, OK ?...  No... I can't do that.  Shut it down, chingada ! Don't be an asshole. You'll find another set of wombats to exploit !  These sudden irrational outbursts, Hector... Did they begin in childhood or in puberty?  Get out of my face.  Am I in your face ? What an interesting choice of words ! Would you like me in your face ? You're married, Hector ?... If you wanna deal with any of these problems, I'll give you special rates.  Special rates ?... Ha ! ha !... What, like frequent flyer miles ?... Let me ask you something. Are you really color-blind, or is that some shit you feed them with so they feel sorry for you ?  No, unfortunately I am color... Did you bug the office ?  Hey, for a shrink, you're pretty fucking dense.  Who's there ?  There she is, a little angel, dancing on the head of a pin.  No.  And wet !  Cold or tasteful ?  I can't tell you if your eyes are bloodshed.  What is that ?  That's right. You showed a remarkable restraint.  But what if I am ashamed of what I do.  Who told you I was a shrink ?  How did you know ?  How I look at you ?  So, you have a tuning fork too.  We seem to be playing the same game.  Because you're the fantasy girl, aren't you? Quicksilver? The face glimpsed across a crowded room?  You'll be whatever they want you to be... no substance, no rules. Light as air. So your feet never have to touch those burning hot coals the rest of us walk around on.  Yeah, sort of like that.  Yes, but that was part of my plan. I mean, I wanted to. Thank you.  No, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. What are you being so tough for ?  I am thinking you should just let me take you home and forget about this stupid taxi.  Give me your phone number and address.  She floats away on her sweet young legs. Waves to him once. Drives away without a backward glance.  Richie is what he is.  What exactly is that?  He was born back of a van going up Route 5 to a Grateful Dead concert. The first sound he ever heard was "Beat It On Down The Line."  Well, it could be worse.  Not much.  How long have you been his guardian?  Since he was nine or ten. But I've always taken care of Richie.  So, what can I do for you ?  Um, I was hoping you would help me... get Richie out of therapy. Look, I know I'm just his brother, but I've been like a mother and a father to him... and I know I can get overprotective, but...  Why would you want to take Richie out of therapy now ?  What Richie needs is normalcy.  Well, normalcy... Normalcy can be interpreted in a lot of different ways.  Richie has practically been raised by the state... ... the social workers, psychiatrists... forcing him into this, um, psycho-servitude. He is the sweetest kid you'll ever meet, but he thinks of himself as handicapped. It just isn't right.  Well, he's got legal problems. Richie was sentenced by the court to mandatory treatment.  Every kid gets into trouble. And that's why I need you to help get him out.  You know, Dale, it's hard to tell when someone's feeling pain... but I want you to know...  If Richie feels pain... then I feel pain. Pretty much in tune with him. I just wish you'd give us a chance.  Let me check out Richie's status. Then, uh, I'll give probation a call.  Oh, thanks. Thanks, Dr. Capa. I really appreciate it.  You're welcome, Dale. You either lift weights or work with your hands.  Yeah, uh, I make furniture.  Really.  Yeah, I made this desk for Bob, to remind him of New York.  No kidding.  We called it the Chrysler desk.  Chrysler.  You ever see his bed ?  I think I want to continue. You bitch ! I called you a bitch ! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh! Oh! I'm sorry.  Hey !  You idiot !  Hey ! Hey !... Help !... Shit ! Fuck ! Hello ! I am not goin' back to New York, you hear me ? You're stuck with me ! Fuckin' bill. Great.  Capa !  Oh, that's perfect ! That's really perfect ! Just like a cop ! You're never there when you need one !  What did I do now ?  Somebody put a rattlesnake in the mailbox, Hector !  A rattlesnake !  You scared the shit out of me outside.  Oh, I scared you, huh ? What the hell are you doing here ?  I could use some assistance, some of your professional wisdom.  I'm really flattered.  Everyone in the group has an alibi. Except for Casey. He says he was alone in his loft.  Yeah ?  Mm-hmm.  What does that mean ?  What do you make of Casey?  He's a good kid.  You're an asshole, Capa.  Should we analyze that statement, Hector ?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Who is our man ? Help me.  You're the cop. Figure it out.  You know what I think ? I think it was you. You've got the look.  That's right.  Yeah, I been talking to people who knew you both. Everyone says there was a weird competitive thing going between you.  Yeah, that's right. There was. I admit it. He was on the way up... and I was on the way down.  Including... Splat ! It unhinged you.  I bet you've seen every episode of Columbo, huh? Who is it?  That's a very young girl to be going around... fending benders.  Here she comes. Weightless, hanging from the sky... wearing a short dress of indeterminate color.  Thank you.  I can recommend someone.  God, I missed you.  Right now ?  I'd like your food five inches to the left.  Yeah, okay.  It's a miracle. I found it. Here he is. Richie Dexter. Legal guardian: Dale Dexter. That's his brother. Kids were put under care, let's see, about six years ago.  Does it say why?  Abandonment, abuse. The children were assigned to a, uh... Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena. A child psychiatrist. Richie was 12. No foster parents. Looks like the doctor retired a couple years after that. Then we lost track of the kids until recently.  What do you mean, "lost track" of them?  Like on a radar : One minute a blip, the next, no blip. Hey, look. This is the lost souls memorial wing. Children of L.A. County of the '90s: 250 000 cases in here, and there's two more down the hall.  Bye.  Hi, Sondra. Someone just let me in.  I didn't just walk in on my own.  Bonnie. Yes.  Thank you very much. Thank you. This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah.  A lot of nice, nice things. A lot of nice art.  Well, I feel like I have so much... so much catching up to do with all of you. And I know that you're very close with Richie. And I was wondering if you could tell me anything that might help me... understand him a little better.  His brother Dale thinks that your "little baby"... should be taken out of therapy.  I think it's a mistake too.  But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal. There's a big gap in Richie's life up until about a year ago. Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you ?  No, I didn't know that. It's sticking out all over.  That was quite a show he gave us in group. You think Richie has a violent streak ?  You really think that I don't care about Richie ?  Clark ?  Hi. Bye-bye.  Okay.  Hey! Is this Dale Dexter's shop here?  Excuse me.  Hello. Did you go to the house?  Yeah. Nobody was home. I would have phoned a... I would have phone ahead, but, uh, I don't have your phone number in our file.  No problem. So, uh, did you make up your mind ?  After Dr. Niedelmeyer, did Richie get another psychiatrist ?  No. No, we moved. Richie went to school. Everything was fine.  Well... that's the problem, Dale. I look at Richie, and I don't see that everything is fine. I see a kid that's on the brink.  A person, uh, gets a bullet in the head. Sometimes they just leave it there 'cause... to fuck around in the brain is gonna paralyze the person. That's Richie.  What's the bullet ?  Whatever it was, I got him away.  You want to talk about that ?  No. I want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs. Let the demons rest. You dig around in Richie's head, he's gonna blow up in your face.  You think he's violent ?  Not with me.  I think you're making a mistake, Dale. This is not the time to take Richie out of therapy. If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.  Jesus Christ. One of you is the same as another.  Yeah.  Mrs. Niedelmeyer?  Hi, I'm Bill Capa. I'm a doctor. I tracked you down through the Psychiatric Institute.  Actually, I was wondering if I could speak to Dr. Niedelmeyer.  I'm treating a young man that was a patient... of Dr. Niedelmeyer's when he was a child. His name is Richie Dexter.  If I could just ask you a few questions.  Just a few questions. Mrs. Niedelmeyer...  Fifty-eight. Now, if I'm not mistaken... last week there were 59 books on the shelf and this week there are only 58 books on the shelf somehow.  Clark... what's the ashtray situation ?  Three. Not four, as recommended. There are three chairs and five assorted sofas.  Who cares ?  Okay, let's get started.  ... an emotional tar baby.  Today I'd like to focus on a most enlightening... and challenging topic.  More or less. You see, the primary romantic relationship... in our life is often a symptom of our illness.  Glad I wore my rubber pants.  We keep making the same neurotic choices over and over every time we choose a new mate. So... If you had a magic wand... if you, uh, had a wish list... and could change your partner... Sondra, how would you make them different ? What's wrong ? What's missing ?  You need a minute to think about it ?  She's totally forgot her Rolodex. Sorry, sorry.  He was jealous.  Well, there's a good chance that he was the one that was sleeping around... and projecting his fantasies and desires onto you.  Fair enough. Casey, what do you got for us?  Well... I met this girl about a month ago. I've painted every inch of her in detail. She's the best model I've ever seen. Completely uninhibited. Does whatever I ask no matter how...  I'll bet she does.  That's right, Buck. See, but this is where the problem comes in. It's what you see beneath the skin... when you study somebody endlessly, the way an artist does. I see a transcendental beauty there... beyond anything I could ever, ever imagine.  How does this woman feel about you?  She thinks I'm the living end because I've got talent. But, I mean, what's talent ? Kick a garbage can... starving artists crawl out, right ? But there's only one, unique her. And, uh, I think it's love, you know ? And, um... I don't know what to do about that.  Do you think she loves you ?  No. No.  Do you care, Casey ?  I don't know. I don't know.  He's a romantic. He loves the suffering.  Maybe being who I am... I have no choice.  Very good, Casey. That's good stuff.  Buck, what do you got?  Oh, nothing to talk about, not compared to that.  It's not a contest.  Hey, Yard Sale, you want to share the ashtray ? Thanks a lot. Forget it. You want to share something, share the ashtray. I got something in my life, something new. You know, she's young. Auburn hair, 5'5", 105. Pretty as hell. I see her on weekends. I don't think she'd sleep with a man unless she was married to him.  Anything else you'd like to tell us?  She doesn't mind the gray, you know. She's fragile... you know ? It's like she's running through my fingers. Two people I loved died. I never thought that I could feel anything.  Good, Buck. Richie. How 'bout you ?  I don't have,really, relationships. I have m-my brother.  Okay. You want to talk about him?  H-He worries a-a lot about me. And he l-loves me. But l... I wish he didn't... love me so m... so much sometimes. I wish l-I had more of a l-life. And I know that everyone h-here thinks that I'm gay... but I'm-I'm not. A-And I don't want to be.  What would you like to be ?  I'd like t-to be a w-woman.  Have you seen a doctor ?  Yeah.  So the next step is the chop.  Thank you, Buck. Anything else you'd like to tell us, Richie ?  Nope.  Very good. Hi, Clark. What would you change about your partner ?  Um, I think I'll pass... today.  Well, Sondra, I have my little problems... but I don't s- see how it's your business...  To decide when I'm gonna share in group and not.  Oh, shut up ! Shut up, shut up ! You promiscuous cunt ! And if you must know, I do have somebody in my life ! Black, emotional hole, unattractive me !  You can say that again !  Fuck you ! Fuck all of you !  Is this what you call "treatment failure" ?  Well, it's not a total loss. He left without counting everything.  So pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough. I had to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of pages in each deposition.  So you were fired.  Yes. In effect. Obsessive-compulsive. Medical leave. "Just please, please don't come back." I do apologize for my outburst in group.  You're screwing Sondra... aren't you?  I'm very fond of Sondra. More than that, perhaps. Sondra is... A very warmhearted woman, but... Tissues. Panty hose. CDs put back in the rack without cases. Frying pans with coagulating grease. Cotton balls. Cotton balls. I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman used. Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the shower. Chewed gum in the ashtrays. I made a list. There were 22 items I couldn't take.  It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to your keen sense of order.  I found someone. This woman thinks I'm messy. It's perfect. She comes, she goes. I don't even know she's been except for the faint smell of perfume.  Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ?  Take a look at this. Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm terrified to go near the woman.  Hello ?... Hello, this is Bill Capa.  Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket?  Goddamn it ! Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches  Fuck you ! Fuck you! Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck... When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ? Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.  I told you to stay the fuck out of it... Hey ! ? Como esta? Gracias.  I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a spooky feeling.  Like mainlining adrenalin, huh ? The rush is really something, huh ? See ? You're my kind of guy !  You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday group ?  Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain.  Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in intensive care.  What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ?  Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a fork. She must have been having dinner. One of her husbands died of unnatural causes.  Probably lost some body fluids.  And that, that kid Richie. That Richie's been busted for drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the house on fire. So what do you think of that ?  I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves.  Hey, the house is surrounded. Come out with your hands up and your legs spread !  What the hell is this ?  Happy birthday, Hector ! Hey, Martinez, come on out ! We got something for you !  For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good fellow ! Which nobody can deny ! Which nobody can deny ! For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good... ! People scream when they see the female cop's buttocks.  If I had known it was your birthday, I'd have come by tomorrow.  Me too. Large shot on the orchestra singing.  Estas son las mananitas. Que cantaba el Rey David.  Oy. Oigan, ivengan a buscar el cake ! Better get your cake. Ivengan a buscar el cake !  Everybody inside !  How come you didn't mention Buck ?  There wasn't anything on him.  You caught me at a bad time.  Can we get in out of the rain?  Have a seat.  I don't like guns. A lightning floods the room with a very bright light. Buck puts  Oh, shit !  Was it raining like this that night ?  Yeah. We were drivin'... me, my wife, my daughter. This guy comes out wavin', "Stop!" So I slow down. My wife said, "No, not here, Buck. It's a bad neighborhood. Besides, the baby's asleep in the back." And I said, "Bad neighborhood, nothing." So I stopped. Never even made it to the other car. I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes wouldn't open. L... Oh, man ! The rain brought me around. This heavy, heavy rain. And I'm on the sidewalk, and I crawl over... and pull my way up and... There are two lateral shots... to the head for my wife... and a single shot through the heart for my daughter. Oh, Jesus, God ! Oh, Jesus. They got, uh... They got $31. The rain nails me every time, man.  Did they ever find out who did it ?  No. I think it was some kind of payback for something. But that's a long story.  Officer Anderson. What can I do for you?  It's Dr. Bill Capa. Remember me ?  Oh, yeah, yeah. The Bob Moore murder case.  I need to talk to you.  I hope you're an early riser. I get off at 6:00.  Okay.  How did you get in here ?  What about the alarm ?  It didn't go off ?  No, goddamn it, there isn't someone in the car ! People are getting killed around here ! You walk around like it's goddamn Disneyland ! What if something were to happen to you ?  This is my happiness mode. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. This is a very nice surprise. Really nice. I'm sorry.  Why don't you take the biggest risk of all and give me... your phone number.  General Patton comes out of the foothills. Oh, he's in the swamp. Oh, oh, he's in the deep abyss. Ooh! Ooh ! And now... Oh, he's having a problem. He's up in the Swiss Alps, ladies and gentlemen. Fire one. Fire... Oh !... A direct hit !  Oh, our, our tank fleet is crippled.  It's goin' away.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, please, please. I gotta get some sleep.  I gotta be up...  I gotta be up at 6:00 in the morning.  Nobody told me Buck was one of your patients.  "Nobody," like Martinez ?  Right.  That's the same "nobody" who didn't tell me Buck was a cop.  Fucking Martinez. That's a can of worms you don't want to mess with.  What about Buck ?  Hey, look, you gotta promise... if I tell you what I know about this shit, it stays between me and you. And you never heard it from me, okay ? Two, Angelo.  Why ?  Why ? Because cops are vindictive sons of bitches. Right, Alex ?  Right.  Fucking asshole. I don't want to spend the rest of my career getting pissed on from above, okay ?  Okay.  Martinez was nailin' Buck's wife.  Holy shit.  Yeah. Both these guys were in narcotics. And those guys usually stick together like shit on a shirt... so who knows how long it's been going on. Anyway, one day, it came out. In the station, they had this big fight in front of everybody. Two days later, Buck's wife gets blown away.  Jesus Christ ! Was there an investigation ?  Of course there was an investigation. Martinez was a suspect. Buck was a suspect. I mean nobody figured Buck forgiving her. For a while, half the station was a suspect.  What do you think ?  I think Buck and Martinez had a lot of enemies on the street. This was just payback for both of 'em.  Hey !... What... What the hell are you doing here ?  Let me get this, huh ? No ?  Well, you think you can do it in 30 ?  Casey !  Casey !  Oh, Jesus Christ. Casey ! Hey ! Casey!  Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Shit !  Out all night Lady did. When nobody else would. Lady did And she did it real good. Once was not enough.  Tell me, Katie What would your mama say.  Who is it ?  Here she comes. Wearing a backpack on her back... making her look even younger than she is. She falls into his arms. And they kiss.  I don't have to be anywhere until this evening.  Oh, God, this is better than normal. This is much better than normal. It's just driving me crazy, that's all. I mean, I don't really know you... who you are... what you do... if you're safe, when you're coming by. You have all the power. I just sit around here and wait for you.  Yeah. I mean, other things happen, but... in the "what I wait for" department, you're it.  Bob's wife. My ex-wife.  Pretty fucked up. Oh, God. I forget that he's dead.  Ten years ago.  Maybe. Hold on. I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead as they were pretending. I don't know who these people are.  One of my patients was killed last night. He was murdered.  The painter. Casey.  A little bit after.  You don't want to know. About a half hour before group. I'm gonna get a shower. You gonna be okay out here ?  Rose.  Rose ! Rose !  Rose ! Jesus !  2ASB... 185...  Five and six are 31. Seven, seven, that makes 45. And that will remain 45, and every single time you count it, it will be 45, no matter what. And then this is five, and that makes 50. And nine is 59. Now that's odd. That's really odd. Now there's 59 again.  What ?  Well, last week... there were 58 books on the bookshelf where there is always... and I mean always, 59 books, and this week there are 59 again, so I don't...  Which one, Sondra ?  Which one, Sondra ?  What did I do ?  I was right about the threats from the Monday group. This cycle of pain. Yesterday's victim becomes tomorrow's monster. Today's the day.  Hi.  Hi, Bill.  Hi, Buck. Casey, uh... is not gonna be joining us tonight, so I think we should get started.  That's typical. Oh, shit!  Buck, are you all right ?  It's none of your fucking business.  I'd like to start, if I may. I'd like to apologize to the group and Sondra. Everything that you said last week in group was right, and that's why I lost my temper. Uh, the young lady that I mentioned last week... that relationship has been terminated. No reason and no hope. She just, just called... and told me, and that's it.  "The sociopath, lacking the restraints that... hold a normal character together, can become anything. Amorality frees her to be universally perfect. A charming chameleon with a scorpion's tail." Do any of you recognize... recognize this woman ?  Give me that ! This your Bonnie ? This is your Bonnie ? Yeah ?  The one you've been boring the living shit out of us with ? This is the one that's saving you from yourself ? Your shopping mall hag ?  The one that makes you smile ?  The one that you wish was a man ?  That Bonnie ? Is that it ?  Sondra... this is my Bonnie.  Let me see that.  Fuckin' A !  Well, yes, of course. This is the woman that I've been talking about. This is my Bonnie. Goddamn it, Buck ! Don't do that ! Do not do that !  Hey, hey, hey !  Stop acting like an... Like an emotional child !  Goddamn tar baby !  Nobody's making anything up... and stop it, stop it, stop it !  Quit it ! You're crumpling the picture up ! I want you to stop showing off ! You're a little brat !  Fuck it ! You have the emotions of a styrofoam cup !  You calm down, and you stop...  How in the name of God... could all of you be going out with the same woman and not know ? Not have a clue ? Including you, Mr. Psycho-fucking-analyst ? Not to mention Bob Moore... who probably took this amazing picture himself in front of his expensive painting. I'm gonna call the Guinness Book of World Records... because I think this woman deserves credit. And I'm gonna make sure that all of your names are included... so you can all share in the glory.  Well, you should know something about sharing, huh, Hector ? I mean, you and Buck must have shared some very tender moments... discussing his wife. Huh ? Why didn't you tell me the truth ?  What truth is that ?  Why didn't you tell me Buck was a cop... not to mention a suspect in a murder case ? Not to mention you, goddamn it.  Because... I'm not your patient, and I don't have to tell you shit !  That's right, you don't have to tell me shit ! Fuckin' tell me anything, do you ? Why won't somebody tell me some fucking truth ?  Get the fuck out of here !  One fuckin' thing ! Can you do that, Buck ?  You really know how to pick your women, you know that ?  I know you can't... you lyin' sack of shit ! You can't fuckin' do it !  Listen. After my wife died, I wanted to slaughter this cock-sucker !  But I realized we both loved her. It became a, sort of a bond between us. Isn't that right, Hector ? Isn't it ? Hector ! Jesus God ! I never got the chance to forgive her. So I forgave him instead.  All right ! So much for the famous fucking Monday group ! Now we have a suspect with a tattoo on her ass and no address. Now the cops need your help. What about the car ? Anybody around here wrote down the license plates numbers ?  "The license plates numbers" ?  Huh ?  Hey, welcome back to L.A., Miss Brown.  Dr. Ashland from New York with the psychiatric convention.  Dr. Ashland ? In the health club.  I don't think she is a sociopath.  Well, then how about something simple and snappy like a multiple personality disorder ? You've fallen into a trap. You are not well. She is not well. And to you, Iit feels like a bond.  She's been acting this thing out as if... it's the only way for her to have a life.  Or lives.  You really want to go on seeing her, do you ?  Yes, I want to see her.  In a, a nonprofessional sense ?  In every sense.  I don't have your magical tuning fork. All I know is that two people are dead... and she seems an excellent suspect. Bill, salmon swim upstream to mate and die. And so do men.  Is that what I'm doing?  Anderson ! I need your help with something.  Hey, man, how ya doin'?  I'm sitting in a restaurant last night, and I'm looking out the window... watching this woman trying to back out of a space right in front of mine.  A beautiful woman ?  Stunning. Anyway, the next thing I know, she busted out the headlight on my car.  Uh-oh. Drives away, right ?  I don't even think she knew what she did.  But you'd like to meet her ? All right, um, I'll see what I can do. You got the license number ?  Yeah. Thanks, man. All right. Thanks.  Sure.  Damn !  I ought to shoot you!  I came to make amends.  So make 'em, loudmouth !  I just spoke to Bill Capa. This license plate might belong to our mystery lady.  Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! It's Dr. Capa again.  I need your help, please !  Mrs. Niedelmeyer, please !  I need you to listen to me ! My best friend was killed. He was stabbed with a knife...  ... 38 times in the chest !  Another patient was bled to death ! I think that I might be next !  I don't have anywhere else to go, Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! What are you hiding from me ? What is it ?  Put that phone down.  Put the phone down ! Put the phone down !  My patient Richie is involved...  If you just help me...  Why ?  What about the family ?  Richie. Jesus Christ ! What did he... What did he do to you ?  W-What I... d-deserved. Y-You shouldn't be here. Get away from me.  Richie... Richie... I have to see Rose. I need her.  Where's Dale ?  Was this your idea, to become Richie ?  What? What happened, Rose ? Please. I need to know.  What happened to Rose ?  And you had to come to group.  But then what ? Rose started coming back ?  Oh, honey.  Jesus! Oh, my God ! Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ ! That crazy bastard !  Rose !  Rose, come back ! Richie ! Richie, leave her alone !  Rose. Come on.  I know. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here. Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.  Back up!  Get back ! Get back !  Quick tongue, slow wit. Deadly, Doctor. Deadly.  Hi, Dale. You fucking daffodil. Put that toy down. Put it in the toolbox. Now ! I got .45 caliber nails in this gun !  What are you doing here, Martinez ?  Aren't you glad I'm here ? Anderson snitched you out ! That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! Let that be your psych lesson for the day !  Go ! Run !  Go ! Get over there ! Get over there !  Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go ! We follows them through the workshop. As they reach a staircase, Bill moves Rose away from him...  Let's go!  Come on ! Come on !  You fucking son of a bitch ! You really fucked it up, didn't ya ? Got your little brother killed.  No !  You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.  No, I saved him !  You knew what was happening...  I didn't know !  Because it happened to you before !  Would you goddamn shut up ?  Could have saved your little brother, but he killed himself.  Shut up ! Shut the fuck up !  You failed, Dale. And you made Rose become Richie !  Oh, you're smart. You're really smart. Bob Moore was smart, but I put a stop to that.  Yeah, you did. Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?  Why are you head-shrinkers all alike, huh ? Y-You can't keep your fucking hands off of us. Huh ? Always pokin' and pushin'. Huh ?  Why'd you do it, Dale ?  Because... that little bitch, Rose, she started sneaking out... playing like Bonnie, modeling for him night after night. Christ, Bill, he was lookin' right through her... gonna recognize Richie in group. Well, I might have missed old Niedelmeyer... but I sure as hell got Bob... real good. - And now... I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off.  The inspiration of madness, Dale.  The tyranny of normalcy, Bill.  Richie.  Rose ! Rose ! Come back ! Rose !  Rose ! Rose ! Stop ! Rose ! A long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with Rose and Bill Wait ! Rose!  For God's sakes, don't jump ! Rose !  Rose ! Stop !  No ! No. No !  Wait !  Rose ! No ! Stop, please ! Just stay there !  If you go, I go ! I swear to God ! I swear to God.  Please, God, just come over here. I don't want you to die. Just give me your hand. Take a risk ! There's no risk in dying. Come on.  Come on.  No !  Come on.  Hey! Listen up, you fucking daffodils ! You gonna leave me hanging here all night, huh ? Get me down, you goddamn cuckoos ! Get me some fucking Band-Aids ! Come on, you fucking daffodils ! Get me out of here !  Hey ! You gonna spend the night up there ? You and little Miss Fender Bender ?
