I call it blood, Detective. If you want, you can call it graffiti. Who ever made that. He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle. This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin. Sure it coulda. Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones. No onions? I'm buying. Care for a hot dog? Thanks, babe. Well, hello there...chocolate, Could be. I knew that. Double homicide. A year ago. Las Halloween. This is special, darlin'. Please? Annie, I need a file. You're bleeding, man. You can't make it. The hell you say. This isn't just about you any more. You're welcome. You sorta looked like you might need my help. How 'bout the morgue? Right. You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward? It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds. Yeah, among others. Hey, man -- you're hit. My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these. I should be trying to stop you. I'm sorry as hell, man. You okay, man? I mean, what just happened. You went out the window. She was beaten and raped. She died in the hospital. You died, man. I can't believe it but here you are. Last year, you and your girlfriend -- You, my friend, are dead. I saw your body. You got buried. Fucking A, my friend. You don't say. Are you nuts, walking into a gun? No further. I'm serious.Don't interfere. Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here. This isn't your place. This isn't your fight. And I don't need your help. No. I have one more thing to do. They couldn't do anything for me. I mean, I've done what I came to do. It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass... It's only a flesh wound. Funboy had to leave this mortal coil. It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much. Did you cap off Funboy. Thank you. For giving a damn. Halloween is coming, soon. You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night. Thirty hours. A day of life, plus change... My name. The venom of bad memories. You were there; you saw her. I saw you seeing her. I need you to tell me what you remember. What happened to us? I saw it, too. The others are called Skank, T- Bird. Street names. Funboy. Watch me, office Albrecht. I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell. Listen: Top Dollar. He "owns the street here." He will "erase my ass." You must listen carefully: the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance. As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance. And I say I'm dead... and I move. I don't know if I can. But you have this... and you know where to come. In a better place. I hope. Shelly would've wanted you to have it. This way, you'll think of her every time you see it... I think he's yours, now. Elly... You brought flowers. As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives. A remembrance. A closure. I have to go. No. Does she have a name? I can pick out a tune now and again. Mister Funboy lives there? Who? I dabble. May I? Victims. Aren't we all. I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin. You cut her. You raped her. You watched! A year ago. Halloween. A man and a woman. In a loft. You helped to murder them. Murderer. Rowdy. Let me fill in some gaps for you. You don't even remember... It's yesterday! Do you know what you destroyed? A year ago. A very nice lady circulated a petition. She died. Last Halloween. Answer yes or no. Do you know what you destroyed? Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air... A whole club of pirates, with pirate names... T-Bird? Another jolly nickname? Wrong answer. Cute nickname, don't you think? And how many lives have you destroyed? You're too late. There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to. But he turned to dust and blew away. I don't have any power for you to take. I want the girl. Unharmed. Now. I can see her. Your pain ends now. Does it hurt? Neither. Magic. Don't waste my time. I'm already alone. Fine with me. Tell me I'll get hurt. That I might die. I've already done that. I don't need anyone's help. Yours included. Shut up. Go away. Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy. Leave me alone -- ! Yes. Shelly? What the hell are you?Not me. It's just the dope, don't worry Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man. I nearly had a fucking heart attack. Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --? No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- ! Does it hurt?! You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts! What the shit are you gonna do about this?! Owwwaaaa -- fuck me! Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit! AAAAaa! Goddd! Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself. How the hell did you do that?Like the car. He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there. Ask Top Dollar. You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar. Top Dollar. I ain't got no fuckin' ring. What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right? Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a -- Nineteen bucks at Sears. Fake, 18k. Crap. Blow yourself, bigmouth.I need to find him kind of soon, Elly. I'm looking for a good guitar man. I'd like to get in touch with him. I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star. Move in, guys. I've got him if you want him. We've got company. Kill a dead guy? Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary... Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip. Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet. Give me a break. That guy's a wacko... That thing is poisonous. What... the hell is that? No. I saw a guitar. This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it? There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird. In blood.I took yours from you. Your little girlfriend? I took hers, too. Your meaningless, petty life? I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose. You're no avenger. You're mine. I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade. Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow. MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief. Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury. And it turned out to be you. At last. I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them. I know. That is why I will prevail. Mr. Grange... ? I wish to possess what you have now. Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY -- in darkness. The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light. I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow. Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up. No shooting. Is he inside? Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead. When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me. Mmm. But tonight I can take what is his. Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course. I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is. I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury. Extremely so. You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow. This is a cobra, Mr. Grange. Yes, it is real. Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird? Your comprehension is not required. Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table. Do you think this childish machismo impresses me? When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time, one building at a time. Whole lives erased. A way of life, polluted. Today, no one forces me to move. I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time, one building at a time. Come now. You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top? You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet. Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you. To be sure. Now tell how your friend died. I know of no one. But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with? I had heard something like this. Describe it for me. The "hit". Who got himself what? An unexpected pleasure.Oh. Chili dog for breakfast... it's original. Well, how's your friend? What's goin' on, Elly?Very well, it's your ass. You'll be alone. Do this thing and you will be vulnerable. The blood will not return. No powers. No reunion. Nothing. Your job is done. You interfere with the living again. Maybe I was wrong about you. You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going. Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we? You work for the dead. Forget that, and you can forget it all. Glad to see you're finally with the program. Get it? Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion. Miss her? Having fun yet? No? I'll give you a hint. Remember whatshername? Interested? Follow the crow.I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition. It got a little rowdy... end of story. Who gives a fuck! I'm a businessman. You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face! That's ancient history. Take the dope, too. Five large, in the drawer right over there. I never saw you. Nice speech. What's it supposed to mean? The night is young. "Our" Crow...? Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em. I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative. One of mine. And it wasn't a standard hit. Bad news. Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me. Tin- Tin got himself whacked.What in the hell... do you call that? And you're gonna tell me who. Was. ALBRECHT This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway. This was somebody else. Somebody new. Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names? You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper. Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
