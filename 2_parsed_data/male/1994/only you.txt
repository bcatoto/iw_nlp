Your grandmother? Your mother. She was your sister. Si. He is your husband, no?You didn't have that with you before. Prima non l'aveva con se. Okay, ma'am, just a moment. Great. Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane. I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane. May I see your boarding pass, please?He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him. Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow. Why? Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them. I'm very sorry. Perhaps you misunderstood? Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago. He said his plans had changed unexpectedly. Would you prefer an interior or exterior room? Buona notte.Did he do some anonymous good deed for her? Is he some kind of celebrity or something? Were they pen pals? Seriously. No, really. What's she doing? What for? What's she doing? So, what's the story with your friend?Your great aunt. Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die. I don't get it. She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?A restaurant. In Piazza Navona. ...has a prior commitment. Ha un numero di telefono? No. Sa dov'e' lui? A very large pig. Huh? You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas. The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way. Who prey on unhappily married women. Who lure unsuspecting-- You don't have to go if you don't want to... I thank you. What do the years matter? I've known you for centuries... You see, in America they care for work, they live to work. But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure... It's siesta. Oh, hello. I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but-- Oh. A pig! A pig! She's saying he's a pig. She's saying he's a-- a-- porco. This is your most lucky day. My family runs a pension not three blocks from here. You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate? And you are?...Let's face it. You want me. So, what are we waiting for? A few times. It's kind of an annual tradi-- Mommy, this is Faith. Faith, this is my mother. So what do you think? Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good... Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren't they? And more... Really... You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke. I could sense the chemistry between us. Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please. It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith. Aren't you going to tell me who you are? Wait. I'll look forward to it. Sure. Well, not exactly... Tonight? Just since yesterday. Sure is. Hello. Uh huh.What great aunt? Who's dying? Exactly. She's been acting weird lately, though. I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication". Like I don't know how to communicate. But Faith-- But, Faith-- Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think-- No. Okaaaaayyyy. Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here? Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something? Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead? I'M NOT PUSHING IT. She didn't give me a chance. She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and-- Yeah-- I came after the woman I love. I can't tell her. She's called off her wedding. She'll never speak to me again. It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy? I thought she'd get a kick out of it. He existed. He was some kid I knew from Little League. He was a real jerk. You say he's a friend of Dwayne's? It was just a joke. I was pushing the arrow. I wanted to get to the next question. I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series. Damon Bradley? That's why you're here? You used to love it when I called you doll. We're all desperate for the money, doll. That's what made this country great. Back me up on this Candy, am I right? It's not exploitation. These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation? She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist. And we didn't have to bring another present? This is the last one before the wedding, right? Well, there's nothing here to eat. Uh, yeah. Sure. Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight? Kate, you're still there? I thought you'd be on your way home by now.Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing. Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know. An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks. Lots of history. For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens? Smoking or non-smoking? It's an amazing place, don't you think? I take it things didn't work out between the two of you? Thanks. My picture's up? It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it? I knew that was too much. Hi there...I was hoping for the real thing. Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real. Granted, ideally, me. I didn't do it to hurt you. I did it for you. I did it for us... If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home. And this is the thanks I get. I did you a favor. You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place. Really?... Very funny. Yes. I'm crazy. You have driven me crazy. No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you. Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up? How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated? Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here? We're talking about love, okay? Let's be rational. What would you call it? As I recall, you were on your way home. And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie. I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember? And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it. Alright. The truth is... I thought we had something here. I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that? Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine. There's no such thing. I'd call that a yes. Do I get a hint? Is something the matter? Okay. I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes. You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto. In that case... no... Are you asking me out? Well. Congratulations. You aren't? I know the feeling. No. Are you're leaving? Hi. Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye. Yeah. Well, was the least I could do. I'm sorry. I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh? You okay? Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn. The Boston Pops. Season tickets. The Sun Also Rises. For Whom the Bell Tolls. The Old Man and the-- Exactly. Besides, no hard feelings. You found somebody. I found somebody. I thought we could double. I just wanted to keep an eye on you. The guy's a total stranger, remember? Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay? Boy, that looks tasty. What is that? We were hungry. What?... Nice dress. Hey-- Oh, thanks. Well, have a good time. Where are you going? Just-- out of curiosity... Anyway, that's why I came by. I need to fix this button. Do you have a needle and thread? And she's a knock-out, too. Yeah. Well, it looks like we both lucked out. I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to. So. You found him. Hi. Do you want me to do it? Oh, and I forgot to tell you. He's here with his mother. He's out by the pool right now. Or Hustler. Mickey Spillane. I'd really rather not say. Uh, I'd rather not say. The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him. Because-- I want you to be happy. Look, I know there's no going back for us. That's not it. I just want to make this up to you. Clear my relationship karma. And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there. Please. Let me do this for you. Let this be my gift to you. It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning... I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel. So, I called there, they said he left yesterday. But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route. He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano. I called. And they told me he's checked in. Because. I know where he is. Fine. Okay. Forget me. Leave me out of it. But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love. Because I don't have the right name?! What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie? So? There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?... Just tell me what it is, I'll say it. I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me. He's a podiatrist. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it. You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign? Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way. Does he know who you are? You didn't answer my question. Does he love you? He's safe. To the foot doctor. Yes?! To be married, I suppose. Why can't you just tell me? You are leaving, aren't you? Are you okay? You want some help? You're limping. I'm in love with you. You said whatever it was you would understand. Thanks. Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself? I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy? And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is. Whatever. And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever. And He did. She told me the name. Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start. And then I saw her. And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light. And life and passion and yearning. And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before-- Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome? My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles. The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three? So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either. I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out. So I was wandering around. Just wandering... When I got hit in the head with this shoe. It was an emergency. I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her. I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again. No! That's not fair. That's not it at all. Look, something somewhere got screwed up. Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed. I may not have the right name, but I was there. I'm the guy. I'm-- skywriting?? Where is she? I have to talk to her.Huh? Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi. Maybe someday we can all get together. I'm on my way to Venice. Why? Well, he'd have to hurry. My flight leaves at four o'clock. I'm at the airport. Why? Right. Thanks a lot. And congratulations. It's not easy finding love these days. My name's Oh, hi. I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's. I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it. Who's this? Dwayne Pinsley? I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
