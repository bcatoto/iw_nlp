Bring her home... I guess. Is MOM... in there? That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case! You don't think... Mother? It's the influence of all those family films. Right, Mom? Hey, Mom??... What happened? Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty. Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod! Hi, Mom. The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies. If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he? DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??! How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her! Should she be the next victim? It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series! MURDERED?!! Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die! I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead. Jeeezzz! Here we go again. I wouldn't give ya a nickel. "Serial Mom"? WOW! Carl's a jerk! Is there a killer loose? Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins! You'd probably date him! He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?" Always the dentist. You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99! Because it's the rules! Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them! Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"? Sorry, ma'am. Get in, Mom! I have to open. In here, Mom... Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer? You scared me. God, Mom! What's the matter? I'm so happy I could shit. Looks good, Mom! Oh Mom... But Mom, the video's not over. Let me see! Thanks, Mom. She sure can pick 'em! TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother! I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet? That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right? Hold on... Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...No comment! He certainly drives like a jerk. I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer? Well, your mother's going to PTA today. We'll see what your teacher has to say. I certainly did not. Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth. We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway. Bird books mostly... What is it, officers? My patient is waiting. Surely you don't think Beverly was involved! Detectives, what is this about? MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!! Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids! BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR! Misty, that's a terrible thing to say! Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident. Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy. And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork. Leave her alone, Chip. I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly. Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause? Beverly! Not the Sterners! Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days. I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week. Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore. Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now! You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids! Don't wake the kids... Shhhh.. You bring me such peace... I love that you're my wife. It's fine with me, Beverly. You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep? I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want... Goodnight, honey. I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher. Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow. Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey. Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. No woman would! Sorry, son. This is a matter for adults. Nice?! He should have been executed! Look at this! "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING! "P" as in... Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin? Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs... Sorry, ma'am. We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton.... Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader? I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life! I... I'm not sure... ...I... oohhh... Excuse me... Yes, I was. Marvin A. Pickles.Objection! Argumentative! Who's voice was it, Dottie? Did you recognize the voice of the caller? Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls? You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles! I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!! The prosecution rests, your honor. What do you mean, you're not sure?! Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you? Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th? State your name, please.What is it, Betty? What's he know? I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son. Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA. Divorce? An alcoholic relative? Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young? That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week. Is there a problem at home? His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films. There is one big problem though. Chip is off to a fine start this year. Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion. Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat. Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher. Mrs... Sutphin?Now, here's a babe! SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down! Are we leaving? Man, that one made me puke! Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.Nice one, huh? Winter's coming. Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it... That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars. Yes, ma'am, it is.Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available? You mean for TV or print? That's right. Your mom killed my brother! Are you Chip Sutphin?
