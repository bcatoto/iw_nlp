PULL, YOU BASTARDS! PULL! Cut the damn rigging free before we  lose the mast! HARD TO PORT! It's going to ram us. It wouldn't dare. Put your backs into it! What's the use? This godless ice  stretches for miles! Would you have  us chow our way back to England? No. But we'll chop our way to the  North Pole if we have to. Inch by  bloody inch. You can't mean to go on! Our journey  is ended! The best we can hope for  now is to get out of this alive! Aye, if the ice ever lets us! The ice will break. And when it does,  we proceed north... as planned. At the cost of how many more lives? There's something out there. You five come with me! The rest stay  with the ship! Look. Back to the ship. Only the ice to starboard, boy. Is it breaking up? Just dancing on the current. It'll  freeze even tighter come next wind. It was a polar bear. That's what I  say. Say all you want, but you weren't  there. It left human tracks. No man could tear those dogs apart. No human. We've roused a demon from  the ice. Something. In the mist. It's the demon! Shoot while you've a  chance! Dead? Captain, I implore you. The men are  frightened and angry. They want your  assurance. They knew the risks when they signed  on. I've come too far to turn back  now. Then you run the danger of pushing  them to mutiny. Let them try. You're awake. I've prepared some  broth. It'll help restore you. I'm... dying. Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple  diagnosis. Are you a physician? How is it you come to be here? There's a startling question, coming  from you. I'm captain of this ship. We sailed  from Archangel a month ago, seeking  a passage to the North Pole. Ah. An explorer. Would-be. I'm plagued with my share  of difficulties just at the moment. I heard. I can't say I blame them. We're  trapped in this ice and bedeviled by  some sort of... creature. Creature? A... human like creature? You know of it? Your men are right to be afraid. Then explain it, whatever it is. It  could save the voyage. I've spent  years planning this. My entire  fortune. You'd persist at the cost of your  own life? The lives of your crew? Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge  we gain, the achievements we leave  behind... those live on. Do you share my madness? Madness? We are kindred, you and I. Men of  ambition. Let me tell you all that I  have lost in such pursuits. I pray  my story will come to mean for you  all that is capricious and evil in  man. Who are you? My name is Frankenstein... Yes, Ma'am. Mrs. Moritz, would you and your  daughter excuse us? She has lost her parents to scarlet  fever. She is an orphan. I loved her from the moment that I  first saw her. Don't cry, Elizabeth. We'll build a fort. So the lightning  can't get us. Nothing can. Not ever. Mrs. Moritz. Mother? Victor, do as you're told! As a boy, I stood at this window and  watched God destroy our tree. Father? I did everything I could. How could all my father's knowledge  and skill fail to save her? What kind of God is He to will this? God took her from us. Our brother. The world is a dizzying place. He needs to vent his outrage to the  skies! Make yourself heard, Willie!  Learning to walk is not an easy thing!  Why should it be so? Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a  feast to be consumed. Women would  have you believe you must walk before  you can run. Or run before you can  waltz! Devil take walking, ladies! My brother  shall learn to waltz! Auntie Justine, Papa said I could  have a sweet. My friends, fatherly pride won't  allow this occasion to pass without  my raising a toast. To Victor. My son. Who read every  medical book in my library by age  thirteen... and then re-read them,  which seemed excessive even to me. Drape yourself in glory, my boy.   Study well.  When you return, you  return a man of medicine. I will  then be honored to call you  "colleague." But never your equal. No. You'll surpass me. Quite a send-off, isn't it? And you? I'll have to do better than that. To be the best there ever was. To  push our knowledge beyond our  dreams... to eradicate disease and  pestilence... to purge mankind of  ignorance and fear... I'm not mad. I've loved you all my life This feels... incestuous. I wish to be your husband. Then come with me to Ingolstadt.  Marry me now. Only you. You make me weak. Your decision. For us. ...until our wedding night. When our  bodies will join. Elizabeth. My more than sister. I'll make you so proud, Mother. Write to us often. We never finished our dance. Someday we shall. The others will look to you while  I'm gone, Willie. Be strong. Elizabeth. This will do nicely. But surely, Professor, you don't  intend we disregard the more...  philosophical works. Those which stir the imagination as  well as the intellect. Paracelsus,  for one. Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius  Agrippa... Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of geneva. I was just clearing my throat. Very well then. You know, you're quite mad. I am not mad. As a march hare. Are you having me on? Of course I am. It pays to humor the  insane. Henry Clerval. Victor, Victor Frankenstein. I know. You have a way of making an  impression. Do you really think I'm mad? Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing  you know, you'll be teaching  toadstools to speak. If it isn't the sorcerer. Found  yourself an apprentice? I'm afraid I rejected his application.  He merely dabbles. Dilettantes need not apply. What  about you? Schiller, isn't it? Von Schiller. I'm interested in real  medicine. Treating the sick. Really? I myself find sick people  rather revolting. I'm here to secure my degree with a  minimum of fuss and hard work that I  might settle into a life of privilege  treating rich old ladies with gout  and dallying with their daughters. You two disgust me. Rich old ladies and their daughters? Can you think of a better reason? Quite a few. Do me a favor then... ...keep them to yourself. It's turning out to be a good year. Not even your father would be that  generous. Miss! The mail arrived! There's one  from Master Victor! What does it say? Read it again? That's no excuse for being a pompous  ass! The entire school heard it. It wasn't  something one could miss. You're a comfort to me, Henry. What now? Writing about it in your  journal won't help. It's a letter to my father. Professor Waldman. Victor, explain yourself. Krempe has a way of provoking my  temper. You have a way of provoking his. I've been watching you. You seem  impatient with your studies. To say the least. I came here to  expand my mind, but honest inquiry  seems strangled at every turn. All  we do is cling to the old knowledge  instead of seeking the new. You disdain accepted wisdom? No, I embrace it... as something to  be used or discarded as we advance  the boundaries of what is known. Now you've got him started. These are exciting times, Henry.  We're entering an era of amazing  breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner.  He wasn't content to bleed people  with leeches, he pioneered a new  frontier of thought ...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox  has been virtually eliminated. I've  heard this speech before. But you haven't listened, Never in  history has so much seemed possible.  We're on the verge of answers undreamt  of... but only if we have the courage  to ask the questions. I understand your frustration. I was  young once myself. Walk me home. Something I'd like to  show you. You know for thousands of years the  Chinese have based their medical  science on the belief that the human  body is a chemical engine run by  electricity? They say we all contain  streams of energy which flow through  us like currents in the ocean, or  rivers in the earth. Their doctors treat patients by  inserting needles like these into  the flesh at various key points to  manipulate these electric streams. Preposterous. I once saw it done, as a boy in  Canton. My parents were missionaries.  The cure was nothing short of  miraculous. I've never forgotten it. Been  fascinated ever since. It smacks of magic. Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it? Electricity. It's utterly fantastic! This is the  sort of thing I'm talking about! We  should be learning this! Why? God alone knows what it means.  Until it has proven value, it's  nothing more than a ghoulish parlor  trick. Hardly fit for the classroom. But the possibilities. Combining  ancient knowledge with new? Something  like this could change our fundamental  views! It is a thrilling direction to  explore. Thrilling and dangerous. Nature can be wonderful and terrible.  Science is not a realm for the  reckless; it needs a conscience. We  must proceed cautiously. Assess as  we go. What I do on my own time is my own  business. The same holds true for  you. You wish to expand your mind?  Fine, do so. You can even join me  here, if you like. But not at the  expense of your normal studies. I doubt that decision is still mine  to make. Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an  apology to Professor Krempe... "...a sincere and heartfelt apology  which you will then read aloud to  him before the assembled student  body and faculty. Why? Our profession needs talent like  yours. Destroy your career over an  issue of pride? What a waste. Go home, Victor. Write the letter, ...and I further wish to extend my  sincerest regrets to Professor Krempe  for my display. My behavior toward  him was both rash and inexcusable. He always was opinionated. What's that? That's where they cut things open  and peer about inside. Things? What sort of things? Re-configure the leads? Numbers four and twelve directly  into the nervous system? Worth a try. ...and the medulla oblongata is the  transition between the spinal cord  and the two parts I've already  named... cerebrum and cerebellum.  Any freshmen feeling queasy yet? All of you, from the look of it.  We'll resume your torture tomorrow. Despite the lack of challenge. Victor. He was trying to be gracious. The strain was evident. Come now, you must take some  satisfaction. You've risen to the  top of your class. A position of  prominence and regard. What keeps me going are my friends. Leave off! Your Elizabeth must be quite a  treasure, Victor ...to justify these prices. Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth? I'm quite serious. Look at all the  charity and clinic work we do. Up  until thirty years ago, the concept  of vaccine was unheard of. You're saying all disease will  eventually be eradicated? I'm convinced. Not by treating  symptoms, but by diving nature's  most jealously-guarded secrets. Do you foresee this happening in our  lifetimes? No. But someday. Thank goodness. We'd be out of work. Only you would think of that! Somebody has to! I tell you what we need, my friends.  Forget the symptoms and diseases.  What we need is a vaccine for death  itself. Oh, now you have gone too far. There's  only one God, Victor. And here's to Him. Everything in  moderation, Frankenstein. Nothing in moderation, Clerval. Yer not stickin' it in me! Got pox  in it, I hear tell! No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine... ...vaccine, from the Latin vacca,  meaning cow ...or vaccinia, meaning cowpox... I told you there was pox in it! ...no, no, cowpox in a minute  quantity, perfectly harmless, gives  you a natural immunity to small ox,  which is the point of this whole  bloody exercise... You doctors kill people! I don' care  what you say, you ain't stickin' it  in me! I most assuredly am! It prevents  disease and it's the law! Why am I  explaining myself? Somebody restrain  this damn fool! Professor? Oh God. They just caught the man who did it. He was a frightened soul who acted  out of fear and ignorance. They'll hang him all the same. Good. I'll be there to hear his  worthless neck snap. Keep your voice down. You don't know  what you're saying. It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't  have happened! The bastard deserves  to die. You're making a scene! Why Waldman? He of all people should  have cheated death! You can't. Death is God's will! I resent God's monopoly. That's blasphemy! Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent  his life trying to help people! All the more reason for us to continue  his work with the poor! No. He had more important work. There are sick people who need our  help. Here and now. Not in some future  time. Consider that. Life and death. Why should You alone have the final  say? To understand the causes of life, we  must first have recourse to death...  and examine the process in minutest  detail... ...his body to be left on public  display for a twenty-four hour period,  thereafter to be consigned to an  unmarked pauper's grave. So the court  has spoken. No longer pathetic and useless Victor. This has got to stop. Nobody's seen you in months. You  haven't attended a single class. I've been preoccupied. We all know how hard you took  Waldman's death. Even Krempe is  sympathetic. But it is time to move  on. It is time to concern yourself  with life. That is my concern. I'm involved in something just now.  I want to finish it in Waldman's  memory. How much longer? Few months perhaps. I'm gathering  the raw materials even now. Materials. That's all they are Tissue  to be re-used. That one. With this cholera come to town, we'll  have plenty more for you. Not optimal. Must use. No time to  replace. Body can't wait. I stitched it together with my own  hands... A patchwork man of my own devising. It took nutrients like a child  receiving milk... blushed like a  young girl with the blood I forced  through its veins... ...all in preparation. God's sake, what is that stench? This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy  just now. What do you want? Things have gone worse with this  cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases  a day now. Classes have been  suspended. University's shut down. Yes? And? Listen to what I'm saying. The  militia's arriving to quarantine the  city. Most of us are getting out  while we still can. You'll be leaving then. Just as well. You never were cut out  for this, Henry. Goodbye. VICTOR! OPEN THE DOOR! LISTEN TO OUT OF THE WAY! Schiller? You're leaving? Where's  all that high talk about treating  the sick? To hell with them. And you. Time running out. Rate of decay  accelerating. Must strike now... or  start again from scratch. Live, you bastard! It's alive. It's alive. What have I done? LET GO OF ME! Massive birth defects. Result is  malfunctional and vile. Have chosen to abort. Stay away! Bring out your deeeaaad! Bring out  your deeeaaad! Stupid bastard! Over here! Oh my God. Victor! No... no... I'm not dead... please...  Don't put me on the cart! I'm not  dead! I'm not dead! I'M NOT DEAD! Yes, yes, I'm coming... Thank God your fever broke. Slowly, now. Just a sip. I've been worried we might lose you.  It's been touch-and-go for a week. A... week? We feared cholera. Turned out to be  pneumonia, brought on by nervous  exhaustion and some idiot running  around in a storm. Is that your diagnosis? Mine and Professor Krempe's. We've been trading off nursing you  in shifts. The rest of the time we're  out working with the cholera victims.  It's his turn for that just now. You've been going round-the-clock? We catch a few hours sleep where we  can. Usually here at your bedside. Everything in moderation, Clerval. Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein. It's the down-and-outs I pity most.  Those who can't fend for themselves.  They'll be dead by the thousands  before this is done. They don't stand  a chance out there. No. They don't. Victor. This place looked like a  charnel house. What went on here? I want to go home. It'll be months before you're well  enough. Meantime, your family must  be frantic not hearing from you. I found these. Some of the postmarks  go back nine months. Why don't you open them? And when  you've the strength, have the decency  to ease their minds with a reply.  Soon as the city ends quarantine,  I'll even mail it for you. Along  with this. It's a beautiful gift. Does her no  good lying here. It can't survive. Not much to look at. Even less to  eat. I don't how we're going to get  through the winter with this yield. One less for us. I'll see if I can scratch a few more  out of the ground. I wish we could thank our benefactor. Nothing in this life comes free of  cost. I'd like to know who and why. Who's been filling your head? It does no harm. Oh, I see. Is it, Papa? Is it the Good Spirit? Who's there? Felix? Children? What is going on here? "...but it's been so long since I've  heard from you. Remember the vow we  took the night you left? You must be  honest with me if your feelings have  changed. Answer for the sake of our  friendship, and both our future  happiness." She wrote that four months ago. A woman like that is far too rare to  be taken lightly. Ch...uur-ch. Church. Fl...oww. ...wer. Flower? Maria! Look! It's snowing! Let them play. There's plenty of  wood for the fire. He's right about that. I know you're there. Won't you speak to me? God in heaven. Would you like to sit by the fire? The music? Or the fire? I'm glad you finally came to the  door. A man shouldn't have to scurry  in the shadows. Why? It can't be as bad as that. I can see you with my hands. If you'll  trust me. You're an outcast. Friends? Do they live around here? Why do you not go to them? People can be kinder than you think. Perhaps I can help. Tell me who. Leave him alone! Our carriage is here. Thank you, Professor. For everything. Take me home, my friend. HE'S COMING HOME! Elizabeth! Justine! What's all the fuss? Why are you  shouting? He's coming home! Tonight! That's what I'm telling you! Open it. It's Victor! What does it say? Married! The two of you? Brilliant! I knew it! Ever since you  were children! Elizabeth? Can I take this to show  Peter? I'll take extra special care, I  promise! Pete's never seen what Victor  looks like! He'll admire it  enormously! Join us for champagne! My son is  coming home! Have you seen Willie? Claude rode over there to see if  held lost track of time. They say he  never arrived. Don't worry, Monsieur, we'll find  him. There! Look! Quite a place. Thank you, Henry. For what? This. My home. My family. If not for you, I'd be dead in a  burial pit somewhere. Elizabeth? We'll organize another search now  that it's light enough. We'll find  her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise. I am cautiously hopeful. With quiet  and proper care he may eventually  regain some or most of his strength. Mr. Frankenstein. We've apprehended  the murderer. Not five miles from  here, hiding in a barn. Who is it? It's very unsettling, sir. And quite  strange. Perhaps you'd better come  with us. Yes. Did you? Did you, Justine? I found her sobbing her eyes out.  Poor thing, I said, what's all this?  And she spilled her heart to me about  Master Victor. How she'd always loved  him, and now he was coming home to  marry mistress Elizabeth. She cried and cried about the  beautiful locket he'd sent. How she  wished it was hers. She swore me  never to tell a soul. That was before the boy went missing,  a'course. I always viewed her with brotherly  affection. I had no idea of her  feelings for me. Rejection can be a powerful wound.  People have been known to do uncanny  things. But to commit so ghastly and terrible  a crime against a child she loved? It's hard to believe. And is it true, Miss Moritz, that  you love Victor Frankenstein? That  your heart was broken? Answer the question. Do you love  Victor Frankenstein? Is it also not true that you murdered  his brother William in a misdirected  crime of passion? So you have claimed. Yet you have no  explanation for this. The locket last seen in the hands of  the poor murdered child was found  hidden in your dress the morning  following the murder. The locket you  so coveted. How did it come to be in your  possession? Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO! Oh God. Justine. Forgive me. My mind was not playing tricks. He  was there in the storm... gloating  over his crimes... challenging me to  come. I've no choice They've done a fine job. Hanging an  innocent for the crime of a fiend. I know only that he is a killer.   And I shall bring back his carcass. WHERE ARE YOU? You speak. How did you find me? Kill me and have done with it. Then why am I here? What did you  want with me? Fine words from a child killer. You  who murdered my brother. How dare you. You're disgusting and  evil. I see it before me. There was something at work in my  soul which I do not understand. Materials. Nothing more. Trace memories in the brain, perhaps. I don't know. What can I do? Friend? Like you? Oh, God, you don't know  what you're asking. And if I consent? Yes. I want this over and done with. I'm all right. I'm safe, What happened up there? I didn't find what I was looking  for. What did you find? These have been fired. At shadows. My nerves got the better  of me. It's not something I can explain  now. Perhaps someday. So do I. A month at most, that's all I ask. Elizabeth, please. Things have not  yet resolved. I must take steps to  see that they do. For our family's  sake. For our sake. You are life itself. We shall seal  our vow. The moment I am done. You must regain your strength to  preside at our wedding... and spoil  your grandchildren later on. These  are duties you cannot shirk. We're all safe now. I promise God forgive me. I prayed never to see these again... Whatever they are. I won't bother asking what or why.  You wouldn't tell me anyway. I just  hope you know what you're doing... ...because if this is a repeat of  Ingolstadt, I won't be around to  pick up the pieces. Why... her? My words. The brain stem was destroyed by the  hanging. We'll need another. The  body looks like it will do, but some  extremities are too decayed. They'll  have to be replaced. The fresher the  better. Want some yourself? Or just like to  watch? What do you say, lover? I can make  it good for you. What is this? This was not taken from a grave. No. I draw the line. I will not! Kill me now! No. Not tomorrow, not next week,  Marry me today. It was misguided and pointless. Is  your answer yes? We'll leave this afternoon, right  after the ceremony. Pack only what  you need. Yes. We're in danger here. Every  moment we stay. I do. But you must trust me for now. This is not... the grand wedding...  I had hoped to give you... We gather now in the sight of God to  witness this man and woman bond their  lives in matrimonial vow. Be especially on your guard. Stay  cautious to a fault. Who is this man, sir? How shall we  know him? He is huge and deformed... and quite  insane. He killed Master William and sent  Justine Moritz to the noose! No  hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard  on sight! Are you sure you'll be all right? Yes, don't worry. I'll look after  your father. You look after her. I'll be back as soon as I've got her  far away and safe. We'll hunt this  fiend down together. Only if you'll tell me who he is. I owe you that. Done. Victor? You're the Devil himself. That was the last ferry. There's  nothing else till morning. Damn it We'll ride on ahead and secure you  lodging for the night. Make sure you keep your pistols dry They're dry enough. And if they fail,  we've others. And if those fail... ...we can always gut the bastard. Don't worry, sir. You're well guarded.  Now why don't you go upstairs to  your wife? It's not often a man has  his wedding night. Now husband and wife. I remember the first time I ever saw  you. Crossing the floor of the grand  ballroom with my parents at your  side. So beautiful even then. Open this door for no-one! I saw him in a flash of lightning!  He vanished toward the lake! Get after him! We lost him. Why are those open? Elizabeth. ELIZABETH! Oh God... he took her heart... he  took her heart from me... Live. Say my name. Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you  remember. Say my name. You must. You must. Say my name. Say you remember. Yes. I'll help you remember. ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three. She's not for you. Elizabeth, no! Say my name. SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NO! You killed her! You killed her! Victor. All that I once loved lies in a  shallow grave. By my hand. Let it go. You should have been my father's  son. He would have been so proud. VICTOR! COME BACK! I followed his trail north... always  north... and always one step behind...  never stopping... driven by my fires  of rage... and revenge... A year now I've followed him. Perhaps  more. Only to arrive at this place.  Tired. So very tired. I never did  find... whatever it was... I was  looking for... and neither will you,  my friend. Value life above ambition... or those  glittering prizes you seek will  crumble to dust in your fingers...  as they have in mine. See your loved ones again. I cannot. Rest now. A warming wind. This ice will break yet. How's our guest? He died. Raving about phantoms. He  was mad, poor devil. Gather a detail. Have the body removed  from my cabin. Aye, Captain. Who are you? Yes. What is that to you? Evil as you  are. You drove him to his torment. Then why weep for him? What kindness? Christ. It has a right to bear witness. Stand fast. All of you. THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP! BACK TO THE SHIP! LEAVE IT! GRIGORI! GRIGORI! SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF! Swim. Don't do it... Home
