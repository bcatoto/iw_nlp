Roger, One. Rolling. And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the ghost numbers. They were checking out the Renquist front. She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices here. Uh huh. Right here in river city. And this is a little above market- rate for the horizontal bop, even for a total biscuit like her. Probably because it sounds scary. They call him "The Sand Spider". Sorry, sir. Uh... here's what we got. Yes.He's got it. I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these. It's show time. Don't look at the flash. Do not look at the flash. ... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers. Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah-- I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica. --you tell the son of bitch this is Bright Boy Alert. Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert. And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right-- You're welcome. I thought this look like your work. You've reached a new low with this one. I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis. We're dead, right? So... where'd you put the transmitter? Oh shit. Harry... what're you doing? Now what? She could be telling the truth. She's lying. You know about that? Whatya talking? I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe. Clean as a -- Goddamnit, Harry. This is our butts. So your life is in the toilet. So your wife is banging a used car salesman. Sure it's humiliating. But be a man here-- The purse is still at the house. Aw, it's gotta be a typo-- What are you talking about? He could be working her to get to you. Guy's a spook! Sure, Harry. I'm on it. What're you talking about? We have that. Is this national security stuff boring you? Relax. Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her. It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a -- Same thing happened to me with wife two. I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty. I mean empty. She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge. What kind of person would think of that? Nobody believes it can happen to them. Congratulations. Welcome to the club. Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting. I'll just hang then, shall I? You want me to just hang-- ? Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra- fundamentalist. Linked to numerous car-bombings, that cafe bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year. Major player. Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy? Ha! The little prick ditched you! That is so goddamn funny. That's it. Get 'im Harry We'll teach that little puke not to signal. Goddammit! That's outrageous. Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet? Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch -- Copy that. There's another guy, still in the car. What's the plan? Helen's going to be pissed. Uh huh. Want me to lose them? Yeah, right. She could be moving money, guns. Anything. It's all set up... ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist. Okay, reality check. Go. Nope. The art buys are in a separate ledger. In her dreams. Albert Gibson. Three four nine nine one. Well . . . I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement. Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks. Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it. Okay. Okay. De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt. She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion. Uh huh. And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm. I say even money that physicist on the bike is boinkin' her. Fourteen, Harry. See, kids now are ten years ahead of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin-- Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen. Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo. Kids. Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery. What? Here, check these out. Yep. Sleep fast. For Dana, schmuck. Bring your kid something. You know. The dad thing. Harry? HARRY?! Harry! Where are you! It's Talkradio. You're on the air. You're not going anywhere. But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right? I mean-- So, it was your first time. Is this a common thing for you? Cheating? But you didn't. Why not? God! You have no idea how much that turns me on. I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice. And you still reach for your piece every time. Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow. Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age. You're going to stay in school. Do you understand? There are going to be some changes Dana. You're going to start following some rules. And I'm going to be there to see that you do. How was school today? You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin? You know you can always talk to me. Right? Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand. Dana, are you listening to me? I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady. You never used to lie to me. But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong. You seem fine now. Dana, Mr. Hardy called. Why weren't you in class today? Immediate roll. Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge. Vehicle is red-and-white convertible. You have six minutes. Okay. Let's step up the surveillance on her. Put on two more guys. You're kidding. Alright, I want a complete workup on her. Do we know where she is? Sorry. If I break it they can take it out of my pay. Any minute now. Here they come. Get 'em. I'll brief them on the way in. ... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius. Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately-- Let's go. I'll brief you in the air. Why not? You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet? In her Walkman. It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking. I'm giving her an assignment. I am offerring you a choice. If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life. If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone. Your like will be destroyed. There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker. You must work for us. Wait! Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question. You didn't have sexual relations with him? What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job? You tell on me, I tell on you. She's still at my house. GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!! It skips from page nine to eleven. Where's page ten? Give me the page. Yeah, but for who? Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day. Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps. Now. Helen's phone. Her office line and the line at my house. Put a tap on her phone. I still don't believe it. It can't be. It can't be. Not Helen. She's having an affair. He-- Helen. Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib. Just hang a minute. Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch. Abu Kaleem Malik. Son of a bitch! So, you wanna play huh? You little-- Look at the way the little punk is driving. He's all over the place. Look-- he hasn't signalled once. Okay. Here she comes. And make it fast. My horse is getting tired. Stay on him. Gonna try to get a closer shot of Beavis & Butthead. See, that's the problem with terrorists. They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules. Station wagon? What? It's on the way. She says she's got something for me. She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east. Hi, I'm Harry Renquist. I own a-- It doesn't mean anything. She buys antiquities for Khaled. You better watch it. She might file on you for sexual harassment. Harry Tasker. One zero zero two four. I thought you moved out. Will you just open the door! No way. Not Dana. Right. She's only fourteen. Don't be ridiculous. She's only -- how old is she? She knows not to steal. I've taught her better than that. Son of a bitch! Thanks dear. What a team. See you at eight. Got it. Nice touch. Okay, pick me up at eight. The de-brief is at ten hundred. What's this for? What? In the helicopter. Switching to sub-vocal. Gib, you copy? There is no us, you psychotic bitch. You're damaged goods, lady. Oral hygiene? Juno. I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again. Uh, yes, it is important. Yes. And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants. Is that why you got into this business? It's certainly... dramatic. Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words. And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much. That's right. They want something... dramatic. I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see. Well, what's the point of waiting? I'd like that. I adore it. This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken. Dance? I told the guy--- I told the guy, this isn't even my order. Wait here. If you have to use this, use it. Don't choke. Okay? Go down there and kill everybody, I guess. We must be in the Florida Keys . . . the Overseas Highway connects the islands to the mainland. No. Much more. Yes. What? God, you have great legs. Looks that way. No. But I wanted to. She's really a fox, isn't she? I don't take those assignments. 17 years. Yup. Ask me a question I would normally lie to. Yes. Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent. I'm sorry, honey. I don't know what this crazy bitch is on. You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business. You wouldn't believe me. Let the hooker go. She's not important. Now slide the nylons off one by one. Sure, hon. So last night was pretty exciting, huh? No. Doris. The code name of your contact will be Boris. Your code name will be-- Think carefully. You will be lying to the man you love. The person who trusts you the most. No one must know! Especially him. You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing. The security of this nation depends on it. Can you do that? You will be contacted with the assignment. Yes or no. Louder please. Do you still love your husband? Answer the question-- This Simon. Did you sleep with him? What did you need? Why? And you agreed? Let me handle this part. Do you mind? Why did you go to Carlos' hideout? You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate. If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us. Would you say he was boring, then? Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker. You weren't attracted to him at all? Not because you were attracted to him? Why did you continue to see him? What did happen? How long have you been a member of his faction? I thought we might have lunch tomorrow. So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day. Did is work out okay? They said you had to run out. I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch. Uh huh. ...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable... really wild. Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server... It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown-- I couldn't believe it. I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it-- Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth. I'm sorry. Thank you for the party. Look, I know you're upset. I'm really sorry, honey. I raced home as quick-- Baby, I said I'd be there. Really. Trust me. Gotta go, honey. Bye bye. Hi honey. What's going on? I'll handle it. Good thinking, honey. What did you tell him? Uh huh. Okay. Yeah, it was wild. Yeah. You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount... I'm late. Fine, honey. Stay asleep. Beat it. You son of a bitch. Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos? Let me think about it. Hold it a day for me? Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then? But with you, she gets to be hot, right? What does she do? You working on someone right now? Those idiots. What about the husbands? Use 'em and lose 'em. Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run? So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time? I couldn't do it. Sure. Set me up and then don't tell me. So what's your angle? And you've got one. Absolutely.Sure. Say that now. Did you tell her about us, Harry? You think I care about their cause? Or yours? Not at all. See, America is on top now . . . but so was Rome, once. All civilizations crumble. One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run? The only important thing is to live well. And... living well takes money. Not exactly. This is Samir. See if you can guess his specialty. Hello, Harry. Yes what? I've always been a collector at heart. When I see something I want, I have to have it. Especially in this light. This is the only light they had then, so I like to study it this way. I love this place. I love all ruins. Do you like my tomb? The museum financing fell out, so I thought your clients might be interested. Those wimps. It's because I use my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike. I told you to move those crates an hour ago. Come on guys, let's get going. So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters? I agree. Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces. Very good. It's sixth century B.C. Do you like the period? Like one? Hold that thought. Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine. Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions. See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for. Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years. So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist. No, my dear, he is a federal agent. He killed two of my colleagues the other night. So now it's Tasker? Not Renquist? Who's your little friend? His wife. How? What do you want me to do? No. He checked out okay-- It's a good thing you pay me well.His wife? Good. Bring them. Who is this woman? Use the gifts that Allah has given you. Find out who this Renquist it. Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now? Your phones are almost certainly tapped. And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--No. Soon as I turn you'll shoot me. Wait! You got the wrong guy. My name's Simon. Look, just let me go. There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your-- Yeeaoowww!! See. You and this car were meant for each other. Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style. Whattya say? Should we start on the paperwork? Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn! Red hot. Her thighs steam. Some kinda legal secretary of something. Married to some boring jerk. I always have a couple on the hook. You know. There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog. It's great. Dickless. If they took care of business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean? Exactly. The trick is, you gotta pick your target. They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers. But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower. Doesn't matter. I like change. You know, constant turnover. As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios. Well, think of it as playing a role. It's fantasy. You have to work on their dreams. Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours. Okay, just ask yourself. What do women really want? You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years. Stuck in a rut. They need some release. The promise of adventure. A hint of danger. I create that for them. Sorry. Trade secret. It's killer. Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at. No really. I can be honest. But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either. Some are. Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet. But it's not enough. If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle. What're we talking about here? Pussy, right? You can call me Simon. You're very brave to do this... You opened it. Thank you. You saved my life. What's your name? Relax. There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role. You see what I mean? That reaction would give us away in a second. Try to relax. Here. Sit down. Be comfortable. Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you. Can you get away? Just for two days. Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married. They'll be looking for a man traveling alone. Helen, I want you to be my wife. To our assignment. It's serious. That's all I can say. Just meet on K Street under the Key Bridge. At eight sharp. Yes. Now go. Not here. I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again. We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together. For your safety. Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the risk. It was pretty hairy. I thought he had me, a couple of times. But I really can't take credit . . . Three of them. Hardly worth talking about. Two won't bother me again. It's strange. I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins. I know. But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things. I'm sorry, I can't. You recognized my style. See, you're very good. You're a natural at this. Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation. See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running shootout, ending at the Marriot... Did you read the papers yesterday? Cairo was a day at the beach next to this. Ssshhh! We say Op. Covert operation. And this one got a little rough. It's my job to risk my life, but not yours. I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust. Okay. It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now. If I get a signal... I may have to leave suddenly. Are you sure you weren't followed? The same place. One o'clock. I have to go now. See you tomorrow. Remember, I need you. Helen? It's Simon. Is it safe to talk?Boris and Doris? Get going! Of course. Mrs. Tasker. And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal? Taking dictation? I said SIT DOWN. Who do you work for?
