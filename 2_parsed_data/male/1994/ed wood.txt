Uh, Greetings. I am the Count... Uh, beg to differ. It is my home. Greetings. I am the Count. Eddie, where are we? We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago. No. Yes. There is nothing more comfortable. No. I never drink -- wine. It's a pleasure... No problem. I know it by heart... Eddie, I want to thank you. These last few days have been a good time. I know none of my wives would've. I envied him. Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that. Last night was quite a romp. Sorry... Eddie, how was I? Okay. But what if I'm not in too big a hurry? What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life? To smell a flower? Oh. So what is the scene about? So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew? Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture? Really? I don't feel so great. Fine. Let them! There is no such thing as bad press. A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page! First celebrity to ever check into rehab. When I get out of here, I will be healthy. Strong! I will be primed for my comeback! Isn't it wonderful? After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi. I'm sorry, Eddie. I'm so sorry. Formaldehyde. It'll be wonderful. We'll be at peace. In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work. I'm obsolete. I have nothing to live for. Tonight, I should die. And you should come with me. Eddie, I received a letter from the government. They're cutting off my unemployment. That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent... I was thinking about killing myself. Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna? Why are you here?? Eddie, this is quite a scene. Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for... That's fine, Eddie. All in the line of duty. Don't let me slow you down. After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"! But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough. It was too degrading for a big star like me. Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"? Okay! How do we turn this thing on? Fuck you! You come out here. Hey, toss me that J.D. Goddamn, it's cold! Oh, for Christ's sake. Out there ?! What happened to the stream? Let's shoot this fucker! Where do I go? Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot... Correct. So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback. Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one. I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag. I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave. It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king. In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered. Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me. The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture. Eddie, you screwed up. Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget. Just keep looking forward. This is the Philosophical Research Society. A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years. Stop worrying. This is going to raise your spirits. "Dear, you're lovely." "Strap her to the table." "Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty. A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!" Damn! Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this. I'm an old man. It's too long. I'm not getting near that goddamn thing. One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu." Mmph? Where am I? So how'd we do? I never said I could ad-lib... Ach! How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue? This live television is madness! "Beg to differ. This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --" "It is my home." "Greetings. I am the Count." Morphine, with a demerol chaser. Eddie, I'm so broke. I don't know what I'm gonna do... Goulash. Nah. This happens all the time... No hospital. Just take me to the couch... I didn't feel well... Ah! This is very exciting. Dracula? We can't. Those sons-a-bitches control the rights. Those bastards at Universal. I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day. Hmm... my biggest hit? That would probably be "Dracula." That's good. I could use the money. Well... can't I play the romantic part? I'm tired of always being the bad guy. You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo! I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl... Who do I play? But, I don't like horses. Do I have to get on one? BULLSHIT! I am ready now! Roll the camera!! Of course! Dracula requires presence . It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand -- Uh, Eddie, do you have my money? I am always on time. Ah, so I pull the strings! I don't understand. Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde! Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde! I'm looking forward to this production. Eddie, what kind of movie is this? Eddie, you got a new movie for me?! Don't worry. I do it every Halloween. No thank you, Eddie. I'll be alright. I am getting tired. I need to take my medicine. You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian. Vampira, look at me! Stare into my eyes. Vampira! You will come under my spell! You will be my slave of love. I think she's a honey. Look at those jugs. Certainly. But now the children of the night are calling me. Shh! I'm coming! I will feed you! Take my word for it. You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula." The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them. Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth. The blood. The blood is horror. They were mythic . They had a poetry to them. And you know what else? The women prefer the traditional monsters. They don't want the classic horror films anymore. Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense! No more. I haven't worked in four years. This town, it chews you up, then spits you out. I'm just an ex-bogeyman. Make a right. Back in the old days, yes. But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela. I have no next picture. I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen. Oh, there's my bus. Shit, where's my transfer?! I apologize. When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance. It takes me much time to re-emerge. Thank you. Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk! Yes. I'm embarking on another bus- and�truck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable. Because I'm planning on dying soon. Ha! Who are you? What do you want? Huh? I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway. I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind. But I like the dark gray one. Which one is the red one? Rolling. Don't you want a second take, for protection? Rolling.This is kind of a stream-- These shoes are itchy. Nothin'! I told him he was great. You really think so? I got the early edition! It was just dropped off at the newsstand.I predict we're lost. YES! My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit! I can't believe this! I sleep in coffins! So you sleep in coffins?! Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine? Ah, cheer up! Don't lose heart over what happened tonight. I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success! Mr. Lugosi ! It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you. Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL! Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing? Incidentally, you promise you're not going to scratch my car...? My pleasure. I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny. Bravo! Bravo! Magnifico! Eddie, we're in show biz! It's all about razzle-dazzle. Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything. There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo. I made it up. It's horseshit! I guessed. I'm Criswell. I know all. Ah. The director of "Glen Or Glenda." And who may you be?No. They say his eligibility ran out years ago. We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild. We'll do our best. Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.I just wish you coulda seen the movie. Yeah, she's really somethin'. Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits? Has anyone ever been to Downey? Perfect. And, cut... That's great. Let's do a take. Uh... you're a very important and respected man. You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event. No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later. Soon, Bela... Soon. No, you look good. And the tests came back fine. C'mon... I've got some good news. The doctor says you're all better. You can come home. Bela, they're parasites! They just want to exploit you. What happened?! Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right. Don't worry. Bela, I'm on your side. C'mon, give me the gun... If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink. What are you drinking? Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea. Don't you have any savings? Jesus Christ, what an evening. What happened? What are you doing? Norma. She changed her mind. She doesn't wanna marry me. Can you put down the gun? Shit! Bela, what's with the gun? I know it's a lot to give you at the last second. I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech. No. Seriously. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me. A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning. Bela. I just wanna thank you again for last night. Alright! Let's put it on film. CAMERA! SOUND! Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight. Huh? Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you. Once you're in it, it warms up. This'll look a lot better. We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater. You'll be fighting with the octopus. Nonsense! You look great -- Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap? We'll film around you for a while. But maybe not. So why didn't you do it? Really? Yeah, I did. But was it a bad decision? At the time, I thought her money would save the movie. Was I wrong to cast Loretta? What is this place? Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore... That's fine, Bela. We're still rolling. Just say "Dear, you're lovely." Okay. Then you'll be sitting on the left . You'll be sitting on the right. You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85. Bela, are you ready? We didn't make a dime. Goodbye! Goodbye! Forget about it. We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again. Bela, don't worry. You're better than all this crap. No Bela, that's "incorporates." Look, just say "This casket has..." "Oh, tract housing, huh?" Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent." "Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs. Applause. "Say, that's a funny place to sleep." Don't worry. I'll do something. What's in the needle? I don't know how to make goulash. Is there anything I can get you? Water? A blanket? Should I call a doctor? Let me take you to the hospital. Bela, what happened?! I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh! No! Doctor Acula ! You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor! Not a count. Ha-ha! Dr. Acula! They do? Shoot. There must be a way to get around that... So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"! Of course! But we need to start off with a bang! Something we know the audience will want to see. Mmm. What was your biggest hit? Sure. Romance, that's great! To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures. Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another! Uh, a cop. NO! You play the father. He's angry ! He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his daughter behave this way! Eh, forget it. What else is big? Teenagers! Jailbait pics! Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks -- How 'bout a western? People love westerns. Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene? You're right, Bela. Now Dracula, that's a part that takes acting. Huh?! Oh yeah, of course. Of course! Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there. Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment -- Bela! It's so great to see you! And eight o'clock on the dot. Right on time! Yeah. You pull the strings -- "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good! Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster. Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything. Well, It's about how people have two personalities. The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside. Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character! Bunny, Bela's here. Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites! I need transvestites ! Are you sure this is okay? Do you want me to get it for you? Hey Bela, how do you do that? Ugh! I hate the way she interrupts the pictures. She doesn't show 'em the proper respect. Well... I guess I should go. Perhaps we could get together again? I never thought of that. The women ? The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons... But you're a big star! Ah, you gotta be jokin'! A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up. Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life. When is your next picture coming out? Don't you bave a car? I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside. I thought it was great. You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie. You know, I saw you perform "Dracula." In Poughkeepsie, in 1938. Really? Why were you buying a coffin? I don't want anything. I'm just a really big, big fan. I've seen all your movies. No. I don't work here. Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi?? If you say so. This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies. I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes! Ssh! He's so big! He's a monster ! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie? I've never seen anything like him! Jesus! Are you serious? I dunno. Lie on the beach? I don't know. Where? No, it's fine. It's real! In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day. What do you mean? Sound! Um, okay... roll camera What's to protect? It was perfect! And, CUT! PRINT IT! LET'S MOVE ON! PLACES, EVERYONE! ROLL CAMERA! NO! It has to be UNDERWATER! You don't understand! The octopus is supposed to live in a lake ! You can't sit ! You gotta walk around, with good posture. You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll never invest in our movie. What do you think you're doin'?! What happened?! Jesus, Connie, what did you do? Absolutely! It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous. This is the big moment...! Yeah. It seems a little crazy, but sometimes you just know . She's perfect for me. I told you, the octopus is made of rubber. This is a piece o' cake. Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot. It's that easy? I don't understand. Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970? How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980? H-how'd you know?! Edward Wood, Sir. Wow. Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got. I have a few hundred dollars. Isn't he? Will he be okay? Excuse me. Doctor? I'm with Mr. Lugosi. How is he? But you used to say -- Did you really mean those things you said..? Dolores, wait! Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie. Quit kidding around. Oh. Er... well you're the file clerk. You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet. Hey, the movie's getting made . That's the main thing. None. But his dad gave me fifty grand. That's Tony McCoy. He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig. That's right... Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message. Does she have room for me? So WHAT?? Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay. I didn't dump you ! Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part! Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry? I blew it! I thought she was rich. Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money. Goddamn landlord. The secretary. Or the file clerk. But there's plenty of other parts. I'm sorry! What did you want me to say? It was the only way I could get the movie made! Dolores, don't you understand? I'm a director now! I made "Glen Or Glenda." Directing is my day job. That's the problem! Nobody cares about my movie! I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do! Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production. All I wanna do is tell stories. The things I find interesting... Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going... But of course I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time. I'm no good. Exactly. Look on the bright side. If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do? But you do! And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts. And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me! Who cares?! We're on a ROLL! These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab. From today on, our lives are different! We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did. Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses. Say it a little louder. I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer. Hon', nobody's bothered but you. Look around -- they couldn't care less. It takes me comfortable. It's a damn good role. Of course it is. And that's why you should play the part. This is my way of telling you -- Since I was a kid. My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing. It just kinda became a habit. Well, I'd really like to know what you think. Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it? I'll Wait... It's a shame. He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore. No! He's very alive. Well... sort of. He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi! And he's really nice. Oh, the hell with you. I met BELA LUGOSI! Close! The other one! No! A horror movie star! Yeah! I met a movie star! Somebody really big ! Huh?! Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something better happened! Sweetie, you won't believe it! I've got the most incredible news! Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door. I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get... Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane." I'm already 30! Honey, what if I'm wrong? What if I just don't have it? The ghost can be barefoot. Give me your shoes ! Dolores, give me your shoes. The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me. Yeah. Well I need the other sixty-thousand. I kinda need it now. Yeah. Exactly! Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money. I don't know. Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one? Oh, of course!! There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk! Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay. For this one, we need $60,000. So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture. I understand you just moved here? Well, uh, if I could I would... That's not true -- No he's not! Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years? "Dracula"! "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"! Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz. Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part. The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller. The title is "Bride Of The Atom." But Bela Lugosi's in it! Dr. Acula ! Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small. So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"! Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents. I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics. It opens next week. Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show. I've got my own movie. It's Wood. Ed Wood. We are gonna finish this film just the way I want it ! Because you can't compromise an artist's vision! Mr. Reynolds! People won't notice. Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture. I like to think so. And PERFECT. CUT! Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk. Ihad to give somebody the dialogue. It's plenty! It's the acorn that will grow a great oak. I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film" Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot! Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!! It's a guaranteed blockbuster! From outer space! It's science- fiction. Very big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films! And pay my back rent from the profits. "Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's money in the bank . Absolutely! You see this script..? Okay -- you know what you do? You produce a film in a commercially proven genre. And after it's a hit, you take the profits from that , and make the twelve Apostles' movies. Raising money is tough. You could say that -- I'm real sorry. My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one. Yeah...? Hruphh...? We're escaping! Don't worry. We're almost there. But I thought me and Dolores had something. Tor, I should be getting home. I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family. Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately. Here's the scene. Loretta, you're in a trance. You glide in and get on the operating table. Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down. But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you. Tor, dialogue is overrated. You look at the classic film actors, who are they? Fairbanks. Chaplin. They didn't talk! They did it all with their face. But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed. Really? Was the third act too intense? Hopefully, very soon. I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM. So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo." He's tough. A brute. But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl. Nah, that doesn't matter! It's a visual medium. Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures. I think you're quite handsome. Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an actor? So, Mr. Johnson -- Oh, of course! Glad you could fit me in your schedule. Mr. Welles, is it all worth it? And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even matter if they're right for the part! Ain't that the truth! I've even bad producers recut my movies -- I can't believe it. These sound like my problems! Oh. Um, I'm Ed Wood! So, what are you working on now? Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you. Excuse me, Sir...? You can't talk that way about my movie. Maybe it needs special handling. Why not?? Georgie, what's with the stag footage?? You said you were cutting in establishing shots ! But I'm proud. I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"! Why?! I did all those things! Hell, I even built the props. Um, I guess -- Gee, I used every frame of film we shot. Maybe they won't notice. Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it? I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free. This movie's gonna look like a million bucks. Don't worry. We're not gonna film any of it. So change the poster. Trust me, you'll be better off. This is a story that's gonna grab people. It's about this guy. He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses. Should he tell her? Should he not tell her? He's torn. George, this is DRAMA. I don't think he's a schmuck. There's still a sex-change -- Because he's my friend . Uh, yeah. Our picture. No, he's not dead! He lives in Baldwin Hills. I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture. Yeah! Lugosi ! What if I told you you could have a star for $1000?? No! It would be something better! Something impressive . The biggest moneymaker you've ever had! Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something! No. Better than tits -- a star ! Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit. And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful?? Yeah. I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out. Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was terrified of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret. Nah, I'm all man. I even fought in WW2. 'Course, I was wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform. No, no, not at all! I love women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them. Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job. I like to dress in women's clothing. Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy. I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct. And I'm good. I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism. Is there a script? So you're not gonna make the movie? Yes, I'm Ed Wood. I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture. So? It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert. Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner. I promise. Right now . Let's drive to Vegas! Let's get married. C'mon! Let's just go. I can't get it to go up. Who's Dr. Tom? Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends. Yeah... I should give her a call. Those assholes. Yes! BINGO! Solar energy! Oh that's gonna seem so scientific. This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film. No compromises . No, BIGGER! What's the biggest energy?? No. They're beyond that! They're smarter than the humans. What's more advanced? The left. It's more natural. Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb. What would that be made of? You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better! I was a fuckin' HACK! I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives... I let Bela down... I might as well be. I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see. I blew it. All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory... I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out... Bela died. Thanks. It's actually the only thing I know how to make. Hey, can you grab that strainer? Stop! Okay? No! I love sex with girls. I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road. Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date. But I think it's important that you know. I like to wear women's clothes. I had to sleep with the lights on for a month. But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that. What do you mean? Yeah! Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street. I even started ushering there. Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines. And I listened to the radio dramas... No. I'm from back east. You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office... I just picked them up on the way over... Not good... I am. How's your father? Oh, hi. How long's he been here? What are you making? The marriage already ended. I got married last night. Hello. LOOK AT HIS SKULL! It's uncanny . You don't wanna be noticed? I know what that's like. Anyway, I brought a copy of the script. You would play the "Ghoul's Wife." I'm really sorry... It's the same film. But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon! It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out! Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming. You'll have fun! No, don't worry, I moved on. I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster." Please! It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers! There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard... No! I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be in it ! See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down. So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money. Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...? No. I think my film is perfect for you. You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood. I'm a film producer. I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson. And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet! Excuse me, Miss Vampira? That was Karloff. Paul, you gotta try harder. I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality. Too tall... too short... And this guy doesn't work at all. Great! Bring 'em in! Bunny, I gotta run. Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma. Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma. Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma. You know, to make the legs move -- Hey. This is looking good! Paul, where's the octopus motor? YES! JUST DO IT! Yes! Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day. But this'll be great, I promise! Nah, it'll work. Where's Bela? Wow, this lab looks great. Except why is there a stove and refrigerator? Yeah...? Just like I always promised. Now you're among the immortals. You're movie stars. Well it looks good. Let's use it! The set doesn't look right! It looks too... empty. Clutter it up. Put a skeleton in the corner. And what's that thing over there? So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work. Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes! Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got terrible notices. But it was a huge hit. And you're gonna make a bundle. This movie's gonna be famous! But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way! I'm directing. NOOOOO!!! Are you IN5ANE? I'm the director! I make the casting decisions around here! No, he would've loved it! Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula. CUE VAMPIRA! Isn't it wonderful? Bela lives! What are you talking about?! It's the premise of the movie. It's even the title, for Christ's sake! I do. Please, be compassionate. I'm your husband! Honey, I have a little secret to share with you. Don't worry, I'll teach you. You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth. Mind if I order some hotcakes...? You know, you're a very attractive girl. Two people do. Orson Welles and me. No, I work in pictures. I'm a director-actor-writer-producer. It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas. Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?No, no! I like girls. So how 'bout Friday? ME?! No, uh, I'm just a transvestite. Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner. Ed Wood! You came to my party. I directed "Bride Of The Atom"! Vampira! Hi, this is Ed Wood."Your movie"?! I wish it was your movie! I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!! Screw you, Wood! I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit. Because I can't sell it to save my life! You made a goddamn feathered fish. Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick? Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it. "Where's the ads"?! The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri! You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.! I did. I established some tits and ass. Yeah?? Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??! And you did a bang-up job, too. But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag. Trust me. It's a career killer. Good. And one more thing. I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea. They'll notice. Look, why don't you let me take over from here? I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots... Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do? Make it seven reels long . I've got contracts with my exhibitors. If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it. I think it's fifty-seven minutes long. Then how's it gonna get in the picture ?! Ed! What's with these revised pages?! A scene in a smelting factory? A buffalo stampede?? Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio Beach ??! What's going on here? I can't afford to film this nonsense! And what's with this new title?! My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"! Yeah! Five pages right before it ends! The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters. I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film! Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick? OUR picture? Isn't he dead? Lugosi? Who? Fine, maybe you're right. But it doesn't friggin' matter. I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about. Yeah. Crap with a star. Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick. I don't make major motion pictures. I make crap. Tits. And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie? You gotta be kiddin' me. So you're not a fruit? Are you a fruit? Hmm. There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications." It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa. Fuck no! But there's a poster. No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie! I've already pre�sold Alabama and Oklahoma. Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff. So we'll just make it without that she-male. We'll fictitionalize it. Yeah, well a couple of things have changed. It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky. Can I help you?"Beg to differ?!" Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank! Oh, tract housing, huh? I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank. What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy shower . I still don't know where to hang the towels! Say, that's a funny place to sleep. Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.Ah! Atomic Age stuff, huh? I like it. I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward. Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus. Maybe we can do business together. Lugosi's washed-up. What else you got? Oh, "Dr. Acula." I get it. I don't like it. Doctor Acula? I don't get it. I can't wait to take a look. So what's up next? Screen Classics? Hmm, don't know them. Really?! Well good for you. So what are you bringing me? Looks like you got some film cans. Wood? Ward? Wood. Hey, what do you know. It is Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one. Right? Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.It is when it works. You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch? "Kane." The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame. Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams? Tell me about it. I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a Mexican ! Ugh, I hate when that happens. It's the damn money men. You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods. And then they all think they're a director... Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else. But I can't find the soundtrack -- I think I left it in Malta. My pleasure. I'm Orson Welles. Yes?Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu." Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside. So how long have you known Eddie? Hey, don't blame me! You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling! What octopus motor? You're sure ??? You're sure this is gonna work? Ed, you said you were getting permission. We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner. Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East. She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's very interested in the picture business! Uh, yoo-hoo. Excuse me! Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news. Here's to Ed. For making us into something. I don't know. Lines around the block.B-but it's our money -- Mr. Wood? What do you think you're doing ?! I thought this was a group effort. This is our choir director. He's gonna play the young hero. Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid? Mr. Wood! ...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?Yes? Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?! How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night??? That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony! "Perfect"? Mr. Wood, do you know anything about the art of film production?! What'd you give him all the lines for?? He's unintelligible! Just, it doesn't look like very much. Lugosi ??! Didn't be pass on? Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars? I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb. Graverobbers from what ?? Would that work? Oh! Our church has the money for one film. We just don't have it for all twelve... I'm interested in the picture business. My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money. Hmm, so you're in the picture business? Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check. Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord. Could you please open up? Mr. Wood?!He's so great, you hire him. Yeah? Well now he's a junkie. He don't deserve to work. He's a bum . Hey big shot, get off your ass. They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.What is happening? My eyes are killink me. Forget her! Move on. A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish. My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see? No! Many duds, before I find her. Nonsense! You must try our hot glug. Don't worry. You just haven't met right woman yet. Oopsy. That cabbage goes right through me. The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know! Hey! You're not eatink. Okey-dokey. But Greta say -- Bela, he talk. Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk. No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk. Edvard! I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read. And she no like. I like. When do movie shoot? But what bout accent? Some people tink I haf too much accent. No. With hair, yah. But I must shave head for wrestlink. It scare da crowds. Dey like that. Mm, not good-lookink enough. Tor! Could we moovf to table? Da pleasure be mine.
