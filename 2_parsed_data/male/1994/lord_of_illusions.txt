And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix, you're my instrument. From now on, you'll be called the Puritan... We'll come back to this. Get about your business. Hush... I said hush. What is it? I think he's in love. You don't like him, do you? Maybe.  Go fetch him. Are we ready? No.  He's gone too far. He's not going to get the chance. If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy. So stay out here. Look around.  If you find 'the child, yell.  She's got blonde hair, that's all I know. Hey, Quaid.  I thought you said you weren't coming back. I changed my mind. Stay the fuck away! Pimm!  Get over here! You're going to be okay. I knew you'd come. I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg. Fuck you. You don't think I've got it to give? No! You're wrong. I could eat your fucking soul, Swann. You want to know what the world really looks like? Want to see flesh with a god's eyes? Aah! Get away from the door! Swann? Here he is. Take a look, Swann!  These are your friends. Swann.  It's okay. Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head. You want to be like that, Swann?  Mud and shit? Come here.  Share the power. Swann!  Swann! Help me! Jesus- Help me! Swann?  What are you doing? Binding you. Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you! Swï¿½ It's finished. Dead. We bury him so deep no one will ever find him. D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour. Right. Mister D'Amour? Yeah.  It's French. Mister D'Amour? Right. Mister D'Amour? Yeah? You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him. How much? Thirty-five bucks. Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled. Just kidding. I've got my life in there. Hello, L.A. Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour. You bet. Nine-eighteen p.m.  Tapert's either got a great sense of humour or he's paying her to laugh. disgust) Jesus. He's finished. Nine twenty-six p.m.  He's off again. Superstitious? Oh my God! Ahh. . . Fuckhead. What the fuck!? Shit! Don't touch him." Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm. Yes. Yes. Don't leave me. You need an ambulance. Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading? NO ... I... My God. What? You've taken some strange journeys in your life. Yeah.  You could say that. You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you. You don't like that. Not much. You can't change it.  You have to walk... ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it. Hold on. I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home... The Puritan? Yes... Who is he? Shit. What were you doing up there? I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud. Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield. Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read. What makes you so sure? I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan? New one on me. Okay.  Let's see him. Where the fuck is he? He got up and walked. After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones. I don't think he'd have given a shit. I know him.  I saw him. I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life. No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit. Like you. He won't. What do you mean, "all of us?" About? What about death? "I really want to see you, Lord, And it won't take long, my Lord, My sweet Lord..." The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic... Yeah. Remember Quaid? Somebody killed him. I just saw him. I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there? No. I'm not going near him. Higher.  Another inch.  The left hand side's too low. Good.  There. Yes? What...? Shit. Mr. D'Amour? Go away. It's one in the afternoon. What are you, my mother? I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night. Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me -- We've never met. Then what do you want? I'm here to offer you a job. I'm going back to New York in-- Shit!  I'm outta here. Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day? Do I get lunch? Whose is the car? Mine. Nah.  You're driving it too carefully. Maybe I just bought it. Somebody's been smoking in here for months. Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is? You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. I work for the best illusionist in the world. Philip Swann? You know of him? I saw him in Vegas once. Are you a gambling man? When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician. Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist. What's the difference? Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real. Any movie stars buried here? Probably. It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view. I don't think the dead much care. Are you sure? Are you a believer, then? I've signed on for them all in my time.  Hindu.  Catholic. You can't have too many saviours. Who is she? Swann's wife. Did your husband know Quaid? You don't? What's the connection? Why not? And you don't ask questions? Does that mean...? But obviously you still care what happens to him. He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery. Sorry.  You asked. Where do I sign? Harry. I'm no bodyguard. When do you want me to start? Do you? Sure. You're not listening to me, Loomis. The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York. No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation. You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on? I got to go.  I'm late. Call me tomorrow. There's other guys as good as me, Loomis. Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me. A couple of weeks. One question. What? Who is she? I thought so.  'Night, Harry. Hey, this is a big deal for me. You know what seats like this cost in New York? Valentin! Valentin! I'm here. The guy with Dorothea.  Is that who I think it is? He's young. Ready? Ready. How the fuck does he do that? It's wires, man. I never seen no wires. So what is it?  Magic? Ladies and gentlemen.  You are standing on the threshold of a miracle... My friends ... come with me...into the Great Beyond. He's good. There's something wrong... What happened? It's a trick. Somebody help him. Out of the way!  Out of the way! Get then out of here, for God's sake -- You heard him!  It's not a fucking show! Who are you? Psst! I'm a doctor.  Let me through. I'm sorry... Hey! Got you, fucker! You did. Didn't you? Beats me. Deep shit? I told you -- All right.  It was... ... it was... Deep shit... And this Butterfield guy-- --vanished. Another fucking magician. Jesus. Are you finished with me? For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York? No.  Not yet... Are they treating you okay? I'm sorry I got into this too late.  But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look... Well... how about some of the other illusionists? I can be very persuasive. Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't... ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here. Where'd you learn that? What? That. At birth.  I don't know you -- Harry D'Amour. I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you. I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann. What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business. Was he taking a lot of risks? You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way. Not the Walter Wilder? The one and only. Want to try? You know Vinovich? Sure.  Vivovich. He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit. I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys. People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know? For what? For an introduction. Well... nobody. You do now. I only wear ties for funerals. You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen. It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation. That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room. Have you been in? No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course. He's a little crazy, by the way.  And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer. But they're fake miracles. You believe that? Heaven and Hell? Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real? So could you walk on water? What about Swann's miracles? I heard he was the best. You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory. I'd like to hear them. Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared? With what? Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn? Harry! I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole. They go together. I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers. Who? Nix. Nix? Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix. Who is he? I think maybe he taught Swann. This is me.  See ya around. Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm. I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home... Shit! This is D'Amour. That's okay. I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there. Why?  Because he had you? You didn't marry him for love. So why did you marry him? Just curious. Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix? Dorothea? What about Jennifer Desiderio? Okay.  I'll keep digging. Yes... Desiderio... What the fuck are you doing here? Looking for you.  I tried the hotel. Why'd you come here? You're a detective, with no clues.  Where else are you going to look?  I'm going to keep this brief. Here's thirty thousand dollars. What for? A ticket home, You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her. She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone. Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered. Yes.  It's regrettable Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why. What for?  You need to stay busy? I like to know why things happen. Why people die? Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home. No. Don't try and see her, D'Amour. Just leave her alone.  Let her heal. Lock up, will you? Jennifer's only ever had one visitor. A Mister Quaid? Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told. I won't say anything. Jennifer's been with us four years.  She was coming on nicely.  But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever. What's her problem? She has no real grip on reality. Does anybody? Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together. And what does Jennifer think's real? Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming for her. Jennifer? No. Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield. What about Philip Swann? Why's that? What is? Swann? Who's not? Is he the Puritan? And he's dead? Jennifer! Jesus. Jesus. I want to speak to Dorothea. I'm afraid she's not in. When will she be in? Crank call.  I'll get the number changed. It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good. I left three messages already. Billy?  It's Harry.  Suppose I wanted to get into the repository at the Magic Castle? You've done this before. I've had my moments. I'm sure they'll have this place rigged. How? It'll be something hokey. Houdini'd been proud of you. Whoa... I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe. You heard right. You ever been married? Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce. Why? My life was too weird for her. I love weird. Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is? Nope. What did I tell you?  So fucking hokey. What have we got here? Grab the files! Jesus! I could have lost my fucking hands. That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle. Which was presumably the idea. These are about Nix. You go through these.  Go on! Wait a minute... That's Butterfield... doorway) And who's that? At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix. Take a look at this. A Nix specialty? I don't know any of these tricks... Maybe they're not tricks. I mean, there's no instructions-- What do you mean, they're not tricks? What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between -- Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time. That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew. Knew what? Harry! Where the fuck are you? Okay.  Hold it right there. Get it off me! Hokey enough for you? I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming? I'm coming. Ah, shaddup! Thanks, Billy. Hey, anytime. Actually, no.  This was enough. I can't let you in. Yeah, I know. You want more money, is that it? Dorothea? Leave her alone -- Shut up! I didn't leave.  I was just digging around. Jennifer Desiderio, for one. response) She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon. Why don't you tell me the truth? Nix ran some kind of cult, right?  Some kind of Charlie Manson deal? He was the real thing, right? Stuff? He taught all this to Swann? So Swann was performing magic. not illusions? And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions. Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours. You said you weren't with him for love.  What then? He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he? It's okay. I'm here, aren't I? Nothing's going to happen to you. Nothing you don't want. Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now. I'm sure. He's dead. And they all came... Quaid and Jennifer-- It's okay. Valentin? What the hell-? Aah! Valentin!  Get some lights on! Somebody you know? Which goes first?  My face or your heart? Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here! What are you doing?  This is sacrilege. Are you satisfied now? No. It's all right.  It's not hurting... ...plaster doesn't bleed. It looks like you're not a widow after all. You rigged the illusion to fail, right? Yes. You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes? Yes. And then... because I was getting too close to something -- --or someone, you called Swann I tried to pay you off. Was that Swann's idea? No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after. Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake. Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter? I want to see Swann face to face. Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over? Nix was never interested in you.  It was always Swann. Maybe Valentin's right.  We should let it alone. He went to all that trouble to be dead.  Maybe we should let him stay that way. Watch out! Who's there? No. . . Please. Don't. I don't know. Wait! I'll tell you. I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay away. You had to see who wept for you the most. A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive. They'll never find out. Look, Ma, no wires. You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour. How the fuck do you do that? Now I'm going to have to kill you. I don't think so.  You need me alive. Why?  So you can fuck my wife? Be careful.  Funerals make me trigger-happy. You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick. Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned. Or murdered, like Nix. He deserved it. Maybe he doesn't see it that way.  Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it? I did it for Dorothea. Oh yeah? Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her. So Nix won't come looking for her? It's me betrayed him. And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix. I don't know what else to do. Help me. Listen.  If he's back from the dead, then he is some kind of god.  And he'll find you, wherever the fuck you are.  And if he's just another phony Messiah, then you can stage the greatest come-back in history. Is this the best brandy you've got? If that's what's on the shelves. Can you change a thousand for me? You're shittin' me. Can we go? Oh Jeez. Will that do?  No? That better? I'm sorry. You think I'm an asshole. Didn't know you read minds. I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour.  But you know that. So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about... Is that all? I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die. And you're not? Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations. And he didn't have them? He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks. Is that all? No. At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly.  Shit... And you believed him? I saw it with my own fucking eyes!  See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth. Are you ready for that? Hey! Thought not. Dorothea? She's not here. Did she know where Nix was buried? No. Who else did?  Did Valentin? Yes. Jesus! He will come!  He will come! He will come! Not yet. I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks... Butterfield! In the corner... Oh Christ!  Oh Christ! They got here before us. Looks that way. Shit! Swann?  Swann! D'Amour -- Shit... Help me. Swann! Swann! Give me a hand.  I got Valentin. He's got Dorothea. And Nix? Him too. We've got to get you to a hospital. Don't bother. Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already. I'm sorry, D'Amour... What about? ... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more. ... no... He's better off this way. Nobody's better off this wav! You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour. That's where we're all going. In my time, and nobody else's. Aaarrrgh! Jesus... what the hell's going on in there? At a guess... they just resurrected him. Fuck. Children... Will you suffer to come unto me? I've come back to share the wisdom of the grave.  Will you hear it? Follow me then. Do I know you, child? Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun this time, child? Where's Swann? He'll come.  We've got unfinished business, he and I. Something terrible's going to happen.  But if you hold on to me, very tight, you may live a little longer. Are you ready for my wisdom? This is where we killed him. You didn't try hard enough. I can't... I can't go any further... Here is my wisdom. Yes, show us! Show us!  Show us! Whatever he's doing to her, stop him! You see, I escaped the grave. So I have to give something to the grave in return. What's happening? I have to give something back. So I'm giving you. You're not worthy.  None of you.  Only Swann was worthy. You just waited like lambs. Well I'm not your shepherd. Aah! You're not Swann.  Who are you? Oh... I know what you want. He lets Dorothea slip from his arms. Hang on! Nix! There you are. I've had a lot of time to think about you.  Where I went wrong... And? I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world. You could still help me do that. Why would I want to? Because you've got nothing else to live for. Not true. The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me I've got to help him. Nix has got to have a weak spot.  Everybody's got a fucking weak spot. Will you help me? Yes. You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to. Yes. But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was. Yes. Wait... you still feel something for that bitch? No! Liar! Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!? She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy. I'll show you! Harry! Harry!  Stop him! Where is she? Where did she go? You've got Swann's disease. You think a little courage, a little love, and it'll all be all right.  Wrong! Oh God! Tell me where she is... and I'll make it go away... Oh God... oh God... Dorothea! Dorothea!  Dorothea! No!  No!  No! ... oh... God... ...yes? There you are, child. I... have... to. Come on, child.  I want Swann to see you die. What are you looking at? There... there! I'm okay.  I'm okay. One... last... illusion... ... D'Amour... I am the purest of the pure.  I am the darkest of the dark... Harry.  You can't kill him. He did something with the ground. Yes? Can you do it? I don't know. Try. I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond Hell. Get out of here! No!  No!  No! I think so. What the fuck? Out!  Out! It's finished.
