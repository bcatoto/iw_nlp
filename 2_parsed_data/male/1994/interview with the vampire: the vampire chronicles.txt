We are a pair, and that's what counts. Your melancholy eyes... You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes. I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn. No. Louis, I swear I did not. Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me. I couldn't prevent it. Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you - I can't save her. Follow me - that way - through my cell - Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing. A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you -- Are these not the answers you came for? Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart. How he must have loved you. You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much. But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will. So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for? It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away. Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did. I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own. She is. If you say so. You are innocent. Your lover. I was waiting for you... Knew? You mean he is... The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new... You fell too much. So much you make me feel... None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world. I have not spoken to him... And perhaps this is the only real evil left... Perhaps... I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good? No. That is a picture, nothing more. Surely you know the one who made you... Nothing if not vampires... Ah! You have questions? If there were a leader, I would be the one. You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away. But how did you come into existence? Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe... They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed. Yes, and very beautiful.Louis, put me in my coffin... Laudanum! Absinthe? You gave then absinthe? We forgive each other then? Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them? Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess. Stop pestering me then! What plans? Not you my dear. You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both. Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you. What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me! Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't. Stop her Louis! It will grow back again! What you are? You would be something other than you are? But you're the fairest by far. Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away. I didn't realise. What night? What do you mean? Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy. It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child. Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again. And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis. I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you. You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat... If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat. You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore. I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day! You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me? Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one. Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us... I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me... I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming... You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again. No... You come back to me Louis... Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me --- Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie... Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter? Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy. That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops. Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well. Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive. You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her - You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine... She's here, your wounded one. Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child. Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves. That and more. Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms. Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on. In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you. THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!! Unless I make her one of us... You finish her - if you feel so much - I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah! I know. Let her alone. Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment. Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God. What do you imagine you are Louis? What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend? And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that? Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough? You fool, what have you done? Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know. Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour! I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember? As did the one who made me. Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs. I don't know any hell - The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along. Read her thoughts. The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead. Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them. Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport! Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle -- There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some... I know. It gets cold so fast. You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly. The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too. You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes. Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching. Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven. You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it. You have fed. You were made for this... Forget the crucifix. Take him. Take him. Come, you're going to feed now. You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most. You're sure? Did I hear a yes? You asked for death. I didn't promise it - You really want to be with them? Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive. Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong. I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you? Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean. You've just done it - Let's call that a start. Call him. You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him. Vampires. We thrive on blood. You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me? They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy... I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it? You're not afraid of anything, are you? And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it? You want death? Is it death you want? They would have killed you -What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we? You were their leader. They trusted you. And yet you knew what I would o. You didn't even warm them, did you? I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again. You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen. You let them do it. I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie. You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice. Not without Claudia. Where is she? Where is she? Where's Claudia? Lestat! You knew Lestat! Yes... My God... And the vampires of the Theatre? That's what the one who made me said. We can do that? You said there were none. Then I leave too. We want no quarrel with him. Then blame the one who made her... But why? I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others. No, my beloved, my child. Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter. Listen to me. He knew nothing. He just didn't care. My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing. And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil? Then God does not exist... Then there is nothing. You mean we are not children of Satan? But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil... Who made us what we are? What are we? So you have the answers... Are you the leader of tis group? We had feared we were the only ones... Your lips, they didn't move. Monstrous. What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human. Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even. It's only mortal death. She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember. Yes... Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it! How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become? He can protect us, Claudia. So you felt it too! That's not so. Never. Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you. Do you think I would let them harm you? What danger? I've seen enough of this! I loathe it! This is monstrous! This is no performance. No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is. They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint. They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound. Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen. Come, Claudia... You know her? You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this -- You are more beautiful than any of them. Claudia, you torture yourself. It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing. Yes. Yes... Still my beautiful child. Not yet. It can't be - The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie - Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear - And you never cried - I can't. Go away from me. Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is. And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge. Don't mock, Claudia... He's dead, Claudia, dead. Lestat. Oh, God forgive us. He'll never let us go. I took your life. He gave you another one. And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter. You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die. We're immortal. You've always known that. Claudia - don't - Claudia! You did that? Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book. He jests. Lestat taught you all you need to know about that. How did you learn to write, Claudia? What have you done? You have it... I tried... Yes. I remember... I have to go now Lestat... It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you... And they frighten you? It's only a siren... Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm. That's all past, Lestat. Don't try to speak... it's alright... CLAUDIA!!! Are you mad???? Claudia! Don't do this thing!!! She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what... You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan! You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan! Lestat, what do you mean? I didn't want to kill her. Lestat! What are you saying? Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel? Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving. No... My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from... NO!!! Lestat - finish this - Why do you do this Lestat? The girl, Lestat - Lestat, she's alive!!!! I don't pretend to know. I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me. We belong in hell. Where are we? What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire! I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect. They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses. But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we... Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me! Paris? You came from Paris? What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell. I can't. But how do you know? Have you ever been caught? But we can live without taking human life. It's possible. Fascination... We can live like this? Off the blood of animals? Do you think so? And if I don't? It can't be... Dear God, what have I done? What have I done? The crucifix - I want a woman. Dying? Sure... Yes... Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised - But why do you want me? I can't go through with it, I tell you. You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are. Kill me if you will, but I can't do this... I can't do it. How do you mean, start? I want it! Give it to me!!! NO!!!!! Diane!!!! What do you want from me? Why should I be? Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house? Yes... Then my luck would have changed. Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said. Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I? Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you? It's over, I'm telling you... But it has. There is no more to tell. He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead. Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris... Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper. He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered. Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that... How could I not? She had to know. Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine... Shall we go on? I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know. Can a vampire feel love? Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity... The same. As you would say today... Bull shit. Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes. Oh, that rumour about crosses? But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans... Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now. What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think? The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years. We love it. I only wanted to prepare you. We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light. Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change. Perhaps lucky for both of us. Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak. I'm a vampire. It's just a room... You followed me here, didn't you? You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life. So you want me to tell you the story of my life... Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me? And the child who did die? What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll? And you know what you ask for? You promise to care for her then? You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!No... If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this... You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself. But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty? No... it can't end like that... Lestat escaped the fire! No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula? You found nothing? Did he die in the fire? And did you lose her? Did she go? But why did you tell her? He did it to make you stay with him! You loved your wife, surely. You loved Yvette... What about coffins? The story about stakes through the heart? You can't look at them... You said the slave had a crucifix... Yes. You're not lying to me, are you? How did you do that? But I thought vampires didn't like the light. You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think... You were going to kill me? Drink my blood? Well, what a lucky break for me. See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it? So shall we begin? What do yo do? Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live? So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes. That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
