I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view. There's something missing here. It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career. It's called evidence. Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it. Find me an eye witness. Dig up a motive. Until then we don't have a case against him. It's circumstantial. Cut him loose. The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy. Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.No -- after you. You always get to go first. I stood up first. I'll go first. Well? The only thing you can do. You must end it. That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart. Would you live that pain again? So, you do this for yourself? What about her? You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod. You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen. You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do. You've been seeing her for over a month now. Have you learned nothing from the past? You. Yes. She's the King's cousin. You may be living -- but this suit is killing me. What are we doing here? Me? Of course. How long is the voyage? The sea and I don't agree with each other. Where we off to? If it came down to it what would you do? We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me. I'm sure they will. For what? Then it's worth the journey. And what do you think you will find in another land? Leaving what? I see. You don't care about life anymore. Do you not hear the wind in the trees? The songs of the birds. The horses breath? There is a whole world around you. Alive. Living. Feel it -- become part of it. Live your life, Highlander. It's going to be a long one. That's all? What else? What else do you hear right now? Life. You've stopped living it. You look, but you do not see. You listen but, you do not hear. Are you always this pleasant? You know what you're problem is? It is a beautiful day. I am merely enjoying it. What? You cannot run from your destiny, Conner. Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change. Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon. They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day. There will be more to the prize than that. Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good. Indeed you did. And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him. Thomas Cavenaugh. I am a teacher of sorts. Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life. We too are brothers, Macleod. In fact, you have more family than you think. You? I know that weapon. It belonged to Juan Romeriz. He's dead? Caution shows wisdom. You'll have no need for that, Highlander.I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank. Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park. I think it was England. We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing. We don't have any proof of that. It's not a homicide, Lieutenant. Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset. We're stepping on their toes of this one. That's not all, Lieutenant. Wait until you see the tape. It's unbelievable. The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy. A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank. It was robbed this morning. Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at. Yeah -- how'd you know that?How? Agreed. This cannot be. I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know? She'll soon be of age. I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner. What do you think? It will be a good harvest this year.I lied. Your life. I've come to strike a bargain with you. I wish to learn the power of changing. Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?Me too. No -- I'm fine. Thank you. I don't know. No. I can take care of myself. I know.Yes -- I think it is. Most people are afraid of death. Maybe he was a lousy shot. It's late. I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it. Good evening, Lieutenant. Lieutenant, you're really frightening me. Is that it? He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head. No. You didn't bring me here to talk about her. Around. No. I don't scare easy. Central Park. I already told you. I took a walk. A few days ago. Congratulations. Detective Bedsoe. You can go first. That doesn't matter. No -- I will. It's done. No. What am I to do? I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone. What worries you? Then she should be an excellent dancer. To ask her to dance. Living. Remember? Not long. We should arrive in the morning. Are you going to be alright? France. You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas. I do not know. I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend. That is a thought that doesn't please me. As friends -- always as friends. For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again. Thank you, Thomas. Maybe myself. England. There is nothing for me here anymore. I'm leaving. That is what bothers me. Yes. The river. I hear you. You? Can't you enjoy it quietly? Sing. Must you do that? Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more. The days of magic are ending. The world is changing. The prize? So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again. So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children. The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it. I learned my fill from Romeriz. Who are you? No. He was my brother. He died at anothers hand. Aye. Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile. I would like to say goodbye. It is. Do not ask me how. I do not know. I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come. Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me. She's a treasure she is. I think you just like to eat dirt. Can you really tell from doing that? Because, it's for the best. There are somethings that are better left unexplained. Where I'm going you cannot follow. Aye. I cannot explain. You'll no see me again. I'm leaving in the morning. I cannot stay. Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there. Sometimes. Different places. Aye? Now I can start to live. To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another. Conner? Get out. He will not stop until it is over. It will end tonight. He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me. We are the last of our kind. The last of the Calans. I do not know what purpose we were put here for. I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it. You wanted the truth -- now you have it. It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried. The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be. --the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word: Courage. I've seen it. How could that be? People don't live for three hundred years. That would mean they'd been trapped in there-- If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall. So? You don't really believe this do you? Why not? Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory? Why don't you tell me. Alright. In the shop you mentioned something about-- Is it? That makes you uncomfortable? I wanted to get to know you better. Why? Because I don't give up all my secrets? I've lived all over the world. Why? I know. Sorry. Good evening. I told you I'm interested in mythology. We can talk about it more. Meet me Tratino's at nine. No. I'm interested in mythology. About what? New York is dangerous place. I don't know. I don't have any answers for you. You remind me of someone I used to know. You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman. I don't know anymore. Because it's my name. I'll be fine. Where did you get it? This is. Go home. Stay out of this. Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman? You got me. He was wearing a bullet proof vest. A lucky guess. In the highlands? Corpses? I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman. What do you want? Are you a cop? I remember you. It will not end tonight. Why did you wait? That's what the Kurgan said. This cannot be. And I you. Go now. Let me walk to heavens door alone. Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more. Don't cry, wee one. It's a better place I go to. It's not for me to decide. Aye -- that I would, lass. Dear, sweet, Rachel. Men's lifes are measured by the good they do. I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it. I've existed in the shadows. My dreams died long ago. I don't know. He is the stronger one. He has a power-- I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't. There's nothing I can do. I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon. Fine. Yes -- when their troubles can harm them. I shouldn't have come back here. It was a mistake. You kept it?I can take care of myself. No. The money, please. Good afternoon... ... Shirley.It does not come off as easily as the young ones. I do not know -- and even if I did... It's not been long enough. What witchcraft is this?I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come. Do you? Then why don't you go out? Meet someone. Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past? Jennifer, there is more to life than work. You stayed here again last night? It has to be. Incredible. The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds. It's a remarkable duplication. What's that next to him? How could they get by him? What? How? Why? They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark. Just a little. Who knows what we're going to find in there. It could be a huge excavation. A little friendly PR never hurt.No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries. It's a syndicated show out of.. What are you hoping to find inside? Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?You can believe what you want. You saw the tape. Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword. Parker. We found him knocked out in the can. No joke, Lieutenant.Alright. It's going to take a few minutes. I have to call and verify the funds. This check is for sixteen thousand dollars. That's a lot of cash to be carrying around. Would you like to deposit this in your account? Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.We had a bargain. You promised. How? And what would'st I gain from this bargain? How comes it your are not afraid?
