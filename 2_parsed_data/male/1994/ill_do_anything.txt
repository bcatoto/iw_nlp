I can't hear over this shhing. ...a play about guess what? That's  right, young people. I can't look. Good idea, let's not. How can we not listen to this? We'll know all we need to from the  reaction. He should be shot, he should be dead,  he should rot in hell, then come  back as the soap cake in a urinal. He didn't like it? Don't worry. He doesn't count. We'll  just wait for the papers. Hey, no matter what this review says,  the play was a great experience for  me. I mean, it is about process, right? Matt's right. Good Lord, it is what  we're alive for. You've just got to be tougher than  this. I took it all down over the phone.  It's quite bad. And, unfortunately,  it's very, very long. I've got a  broken heart and writers' cramp.  He... He's nuts. He savages everyone. I don't want to hear anymore. Let's  dance. Except you, Matt. You filthy bastard. Don't read it. Oh, please. You can't wait to run  out of here, buy a flashlight, and  then go into some dark alley and  drool over every word. You're wrong. I'm maybe relieved and  curious. That's it. ...'in the midst of this delirium of  pretension...' Don't. This divisive crap won't... '...one actor, rather miraculously,  manages to provide passion and, yes,  truth. Matt Hobbs, in the supporting  role of Jesus, manages to touch the  heart long after you thought it numbed  by boredom.' Sorry. Come on, Ma, how could I show up  tonight when my union is boycotting  the Emmys? Look, I have to hang up. I gotta go. Watch! ...and Matt Hobbs for 'Caine Mutiny  Court Martial'... And the winner is  Powers Boothe for 'Jonestown--Story  of a Massacre.' He was good. That took courage. I wonder if they  send you something for just being  nominated? Why are you being so damn foul? Look, Beth... the only... The only reason I haven't... The only thing I have against getting  married is that it might not be fair  because I'm going to stay with acting  forever and you know how erratic the  money's been and there's no resolve... Really? Hey, then we have no problem here.  Marry me. I was just worried whether I could  make you happy. Everything's okay... Great... She's  six or eight pounds even. Oh, God...  Nothing like it. I'll tell you  something amazing. They really reach  right into her stomach and pull out  this baby. It's not just a rumor.  God. I understand the expression  'mind blowing' for the first time.  It means something so wonderful  happens that the top of your head  comes off and your brain pops out.  Part of it was terrifying, the baby  was turned and they couldn't budge  her. I kept looking at this one woman  doctor's eyes. And when Jeannie  finally came out, this doctor and I  each wiped away a tear at the exact  same time, caught ourselves doing  it, and then laughed together at the  same time. Nothing can prepare you  for it. You know why you're alive. How you doing? What's wrong? Could you get her, honey? I have  that big reading tomorrow. Don't worry about money anymore. I didn't want to tell you, because  it may sound a little strange when I  say it out loud. You know me, I'm  never that cocky. But I'm going to  get 'Spider Woman'. It's me or Raul  and I've never been so sure. It's  weird, but I just know it. I do. I am gonna get this part, Beth. Hello... Hi, Beth. I'm glad you  finally returned my call. What are  you so mad about? You know what? I'm being a sort of  gutless wonder here. I'm yelling  back at you because I'm embarrassed.  I won't be able to take the kid when  I said... Why don't you listen for a  second? Beth, I know exactly how long it's  been and I feel strange as hell not  seeing her but this isn't a choice.  I'm broke. It's the driest spell of  my life. I'm not saying it's your  problem, but it's no place for a six- year-old. What can I do? The only  full-time job I seem to have is not  showing how scared I am. What? No,  that's not something I said before. Well, thanks. Beth, Hey... hey. Never mind, I'll  do it. I must get work. I will take anything.  I must get work. I must not be  embarrassed by these pep talks to  myself... ...feathers I'm blowing. What am I,  a duck? 1) I'm not thinking about whether  I'm going to shoot you. I'm... 2)...trying to decide where. 3)...the little spot behind the ear  where you die before you hear the  shot... 4)...on the left side of the belly  which is a very mean place. What am I, a duck? Sure I'll tell you... Favor first...  Do a nice middle-aged lady a favor...  A fair trade... tell you what you  want to know in return for a... ...a pity fu... ...the height of ego. You think your  he-manness can make me get on that  elevator even though I'm phobic?...  I CAN'T GET ON THAT ELEVATOR. I don't  care if... they catch us. DO YOU ...can't get on the elevator... can't  get on the elevator... even if you  make me... even if you make me. Do  you get it?... do you get it?... Hi... See, I did recognize you. You  didn't have to wait for me. Well, challenge. I wasn't sure you'd  remember me... let alone help... Well, that's a fresh slant. This is Matt Hobbs... This is John  Earl McAlpine, the director. ...and Burke Adler, the producer. So, what have you been doing with  yourself... ...the last few years? I'm real bad at interviews, so, if  you don't mind, I'd really prefer to  just read first. That's the way you want to do it? Yes. Maybe we shouldn't even read. I'll  just take your word that you're good. No. I'm serious. There's all different  ways. Did you know Woody Allen never  reads actors? He just looks at them,  feels around a little and then decides  who he wants. That's his way. Doesn't  hear them do a line. I also have a  way. What I do is interview first-- then read--maybe do it all over again  the next day. I call up people the  actor has worked with--check him  out. If he's famous, I do an opinion  survey to test how much people like  him. If he's not famous, I put him  on tape and show it to everyone I  can grab. I believe in screen tests;  I believe in replacing if the dailies  are bad, in cutting people out if  the previews aren't there. Because  I'm not doing movies for theaters  where they serve cappucino in the  lobby. I'm doing popcorn movies. You  want to know what I like? Come to my  house, look at my lamps... you won't  find it in my movies. In my movies,  you'll find out what I know. I know  how to do detail. What I don't know,  I discover. Yesterday we finished  mixing a movie--the last scene is in  a field of windmills which blows up  and all the blades of these windmills  slice through the air, one of which  hits a four-story tank of propane  gas. A humongous explosion scene. I  kept on saying 'louder', and they  finally said to me they couldn't go  louder without distortion. We went  louder. We had to discover a thing,  a filter, but we went louder. I don't  question doing these things. I do  them. So if you want to know if it's  okay to do it differently--not to  talk--to just read first... I say... Ask him--he's the director. Whatever. Okay, let's do it. Do you have any  questions? They only gave me these two pages.  I'd like to give this my best shot.  So if I could read the script and  come back... This part works tomorrow. Oh. Who will I be reading with? Can I read from here? I want you to do it wherever you're  comfortable, but I'd prefer it if  you were comfortable standing up. Time for my buns to have visitors. Go ahead. Go ahead? The director left. That's okay, he trusts me, uh... And  we're just doing the first page. 'Okay, darling Harry, here it is...  If someone were breaking up with me,  I'd like it short and sweet. What  about you?' 'Incredibly drawn out...' 'I can't take care of you right now.  What am I, your mother?' 'Well, what am I? Your duck?' 'We've been together two years and  you act like all you're doing is  blowing away some feathers. So what  I'm asking...' You didn't do the quack. Huh? The stage direction says for him to  quack. I know, but why would he quack when  someone's breaking up with him? Hopefully because it's funny. This isn't a comedy. Then we're in trouble, because they're  already fall down laughing at the  teaser-trailer in fifty-two hundred  and thirty theaters. A comedy? I think I have to make an adjustment  here. Even the title "Little Dick"--it  means so many things. If Cathy doesn't like it, we know  it's a smash. I didn't get it. He did say something  about wanting me back. Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks. ...and I wanted to ask you out. Any time. Okay. Thanks again. I felt funny  asking. I meant asking you to get me the  audition. Who is he? Yeah. He does seem to have a layer  of loser dust on him. Oh, God... why? Why?... What am I going to do? Hey. Hey! HEY!! Look at me. You'd think I was a  writer. I hired this kid as a production  assistant. His father's a business  manager... a few good clients. What happened? He's been driving for me two weeks...  all he has to do is pick me up on  time... he's twenty minutes late and  I have a test screening in the valley.  Everybody's gone from the office. Is that it? You need a lift? Yeah. I'm right over here. ...Not just today... believe me,  there's no way you'll ever make it...  You are going to fail. Listen, listen-- I know about this; you are going to  be a failure. Let's get moving; you said you'd  give me a lift. What the hell are you talking about?  Not in your car... I've got my own. I'll give you a hundred and twenty  dollars to take me... and it will  still be a favor. Get out. Come on. Please. This is very important. A guy got shot on the freeway...  Traffic's tied up. You should leave time for that kind  of thing. What do you need me for? Don't you  drive? Yeah, I drive. I don't like to look  for parking. Yoga shit. I feel like barbed wire.  I don't know if you keep track, but  I'm the sixth independent producer  ever to have two big pictures  scheduled for Christmas, and tonight  we're testing the first one for the  first time... You get it? Yeah. It's important to you. Yes. I don't think I would have put  it that way... but, yes... Keep driving. She runs the test  screenings. Very smart. Very. She  has a real case on me, but so far  I've been keeping it in the bank. Go very slow. Yeah. Thanks. I don't know him, so I have nothing  to compare it to. Not quite himself. Let them in. I'm glad you came yourself instead  of sending your staff. I wouldn't be surprised if tonight's  screening is a monster. Could happen, right? Sure. Okay. Eisner just said he thinks the  screening will be a monster. Sorry to bust your chops. Who has young males? Young women?  Older males?... Older males?... Older males... older males? Older males... over 25? A little over two years. My wife insisted on moving back to  the Midwest--then I was in the  Philippines on the mini-series and... Hey, we just met. Make a guess how we did. Nothing good that happens can make  it worth feeling the way I do now.  Nothing. Who the hell are you? This is private. I'm Mr. Eisner's mother. Oh. Can I get you some water? No, thank you. I don't need the numbers. I loved  it. Now can I get you some water? You might be right. Incredible. I was only there for a  minute in the rape scene, moving  past Charlie Sheen when I left the  hut... I had a great scene cut out...  I was... That's exactly what I was going for. You have to read all that? So what are you, totally wonderful  or what? How come you haven't said anything?  This is great, right? What no? It was such a good score. Thanks. You want to eat something  sometime? Good. I'll call you. Thirty-two, thirty-three. You want to do this regularly for  me? I was gonna offer, but I thought  it would humiliate you. I don't mind an occasional odd job.  But I can't work tomorrow. I have to  get my kid. Okay, I got the cards to look at--I  think I'll ride back here. Maybe I'll drop by your place  tomorrow. Yeah, okay. You were very interesting  to talk to. I swear to God. Honest.  No kidding. You really were. Is it okay? 1) How often do you go to the movies? 2) I'm going to describe a movie in  one sentence and then ask you to  rate it on a scale of... I love this. This is what counts and  this is where you count it. You phone all over--you know what  movies they're waiting to see, whether  your TV spots are working. You know  what the country thinks. ...what feelings do you have about  Cher as a singer, an actress, or  potential date... ...and it's accurate. And you can't fix it... right? Like? I gotta get back. Assume Michelle Pfeiffer is the woman-- which of these 67 actors would you  most like to see her with... Patrick  Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Dustin Hoffman,  Johnny Dep, the guy from 'Major  Dad'... I gotta get back. Is this urgent? 'Cause I gotta go. I'm listening  with an eighth of an ear now. Are you Matt? Uh-huh. I didn't know if we could wait much  longer. Come on in. She's a real nut on smoking anywhere  near the kid. Not really. Is she ready? I have the  taxi waiting. It's three weeks. Yes, it is. It is. He doesn't know? Just because you want to go off with  him doesn't mean I... You're getting the wrong idea. I don't think so. No matter how you  put this... Hey, look, I'm a United States  Marshal. I'm here because she didn't  show up yesterday to start serving  her time. What did she do? Okay, listen carefully, Jeannie. Be  still. Now, what's the most important  thing in life to know? Teeth. Right. Thank you. Brush right after  you eat or your gums will start to  bleed in your sleep and choke you. Reminders?!? You can't say things  like that to a little... Mrs. Hobbs. You know, I've been involved with  this sort of thing for a long time. I thought you'd read them to her. I'm not faulting you. You love your  daughter and this is a very tough  thing to go through. You feel guilty  and caring and it all gets mixed up  so that there's so much important  stuff going down that there's no  sure way of dealing with it, but the  best thing you can do is just make  sure you love her. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. She has her mother's sense of humor. Even if you have to steal to do it? No. Okay, sweetie. We have to go. What? Can we please go? It's going to be okay. I'm you're  dad, you know? So it will be okay.  You and I will make it okay. You  ever ridden in a plane before? Sorry. It's underneath the plane. We can't  get it. There's no way we can get the dress-- it's impossible. Don't kick the seat! As soon as we land. That's the  compromise. God, I didn't hit her--she hit her. You'll have to sit down. Jeannie, we have to sit down. Please. We'll be having some turbulence for  the next twenty minutes or so. Will  the cabin attendants please take  their seats? Sir. I have no idea what to do. Jeannie, you okay? Go back to your seat. I'll get her. She wants to be alone. So we're  upgrading her. Okay... so what do we do? I have a sleeping bag and bed. Which  one do you want? Oh, I thought you took off in the  middle of the night. No. It's Everett. This kid who used  to work for me. He was always crazy  to do his own movie. His movie not only opened to a three  million dollar Friday--it's gotten  great reviews. Listen. I'm tremendously worried  about 'Ground Zero' because of the  bad 'want to sees' you sent over.  But that's just me being nervous  over nothing, isn't it? How're you doing? I'm from next door.  I see you with your kids in the  laundry room... Say, 'Hello, I'm your new neighbor  now too.' Say, 'Jeannie.' Say, 'Isn't that nice... How old is  she?' Say, 'That's nice... I'd like to  play with them... My Daddy didn't  know your phone number, so we just  decided to...' Say 'Daddy has to go to work tonight  and...' I need someone to help me and her on  short notice. I've seen your around  with your kids and hoped you knew  someone in the building or close by.  I've got this new job that starts  now. Do you know anyone? Oh, this is so great. Let's work out  a full-time schedule and... Sort of a test? Please behave, understand? I don't  know what we'll do if this doesn't  work, so behave, sweetheart. Behave,  behave. I'm sorry I bothered you. Jeannie... Your little boy fell, so he's  screaming. And you want her to stay. Great. Thank you. See you later,  Jeannie. No, that's okay. I'm fine with it. I  feel fine. Nothing good that happens tonight  can make it worth feeling the way I  do right now. Nothing. What do you think? So you think it'll score big? That's what breaks your heart.  Jeannie's problem is that she's so  down on herself. I don't know if lucky's the word.  I'm hoping she's asleep when I get  home so I won't have to deal with  her... I'm actually afraid of my own  kid. Excellents? Very goods? 14. Fairs? 30. Poors? What are they doing? Your doctor says this? I can fix this... Get some narration  written. . . You'll cut 30 minutes. It will come  out like butter. We're only 77 minutes now... ...a 47-minute movie... no, that  won't work... Thanks for the support. Can you help? Go ahead. Everyone's tired. You can come back  tomorr... Maybe if she stayed tonight she... I know... I know... You'll see Lucy in the morning. We're  going home. This isn't so great, Millie. F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Daniels, Ed  Harris, John Lithgow, Rip Torn, Willem  Dafoe, John Malkovich... For an action  lead? Okay. Let's play 'State the  Obvious'... F. Murray Abraham has a  nose as long as an Aspen ski line,  Ed Harris is losing his hair, Joe  Mantegna has never played the lead  in a big movie... Willem Dafoe's  teeth... Bob Hoskins looks fur bearing  when he takes off his shirt...  Malkovich... I can't stand it anymore. I can't. What, in God's name, are you doing  in this job you have? I mean him. What, in God's name, do  you know about casting? Me? Yes. What do you know? About anything?  You don't even know you have a habit  of touching your tongue with a finger  like you want to lick yourself. Yet, you talk like you actually know  something... So I want you to tell  me... ...what you know. I'm not going to be drawn into this. I've been an actor most of my life  and this is the first time I've ever  heard what the people calling the  shots sound like when they're casting.  So I really want to find out what,  if anything, you know because what  if nothing you know. Oh, you couldn't be more wrong. And  I'm not talking to you. And I don't  like you. How about you just mind your own  business? You're minding my business. That's  the problem... so, just tell me,  what do you know? Just tell me and I'll shut up. First of all, I've been going to  movies since I was six, for God's  sake... What you know is the size of a  schnozz. What you don't know is that  these guys... ...are for real... ...that they can make something  happen, and even they don't know  what that is till they get in there  and play a little... they can make  something happen that you can't even  imagine... and it's not your fault,  this stupidity... 'cause you're just  this scared little prick who gets to  say he's making movies, and the only  thing they ever taught you is that  what you like doesn't matter. Thanks for understanding. But isn't it almost good manners for  you to feel a little shame? I didn't mean you. You talk about manners--are you  actually so bitter you don't realize  how you acted just now? You're gone,  pal. But at least know that we can't  help that we're making it. Oh, shit. You win. You got lucky  with 'bitter.' That word just scares  me to death. You look down. Thank you. I appreciate the support. Oh. What if 'Ground Zero' doesn't do  well this weekend? What? Okay. Good. What is it? Is that it? Okay, send me... How about last night? You're selling very excellent. Very  excellent presentation. Oh, please... What's the script? Look, I don't want to talk about it.  I just had a real rough day... so  just let it sit there, okay? Yes. Now, I really need to be quiet. No, you're not. You're not stupid  and I'm not bitter... and you know  why? Because there's no cure for  either one and we've got to believe  in some cure for each of us. Oh, Jeannie... I just can't do this  now. Hello? Yes. Cathy... Hey. Just a  second. Jeannie, please... be quiet for one  second... this is very important for  me. So? Wow. Good for you.  Congratulations. Me? This is great. I'll come right  over and pick up the script. Okay.  If you want to. Bring it over.  Goodbye. We might make it yet, kid. Cathy? I'll buzz you in. You've got to be  quick and push hard. But why can't I stay just a little  while? Because this is a very special friend  of Daddy's and I need privacy... Be  fair... I let you wear that dress. Hi. This is my daughter, Queen Elizabeth.  Jeannie, this is Cathy. No. You're going next door. Remember our compromise? You're going  next door to Lucy's to play and you'll  show the kids your dress and I'll  come get you later and we'll go out  someplace and I'll buy you anything  you want for under seventeen dollars? Thanks. Oh...? 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town?' Oh, it's a  remake... And there's a part in it for... Okay... which part? Mr. Deeds? Who are we kidding? I'm even having  trouble getting short parts--I'm  going to say I love it no matter  what you've done to it. Why not? If you can test movies and  premises and want-to-sees, why can't  you test screen tests? What? Why did I rush to you? Because I  felt like I had to... be with someone  and you were closest. What's wrong? Look, I'm sorry if that came out... I'm just trying to say that one of  the things I'm not great at is... No, I haven't. Had a conversation about  shortcomings... Oh, yeah... But I didn't get what  you meant by 'shortcomings.' Hey, if  you think things like that, what are  you doing here? I sure hope you're wrong. Give me a second--all of a sudden,  there's a lot to deal with. It's terrific. Because you're nice and you know I  need work. Sorry, but I think the audition rule  is that I have to be serious unless  the person in charge is wearing a  bathrobe and her nipples are sticking  out... ...this much. It's really good. I get a little  nervous thinking about the  opportunity. If it's okay. I kind of work on these  things in a private... it's just...  it's a little better for me if I  don't... Okay, let's do it. It won't kill me. I swear to God, I don't know which  thing I want more, the sex or the  conversation afterwards. I mean I haven't been to bed with  anyone since Jeannie got here... I  haven't talked to anyone the way I  need to. I haven't seen anything this  beautiful. I haven't felt this good  about life. I mean, I've been lonely,  Cathy. You can't shut the phone off. I left  this number with Jeannie's sitter. I'm not worried. But if the phone  was off, I would worry. Oh. It will be okay. I think the most  important thing is to stop talking  about the phone. Turn it off, monitor,  whatever. I am so serious. Hi, Cathy... All my magazines came  today... Read the new Vanity Fair,  they take apart three people we  hate... Spy is bad this month...  Scorsese didn't get the Time cover,  the plane crash did... ha, ha, ha...  Why aren't you at the office? You  know, I'm getting to the point where  I prefer to reach people's machines...  Bye. Cathy? Are you there? Hello... Are  you there?? I'm going to count to  ten. One, two, three... Did you go to the screening last  night? What did you think? That makes  two bombs in a row for her. ...four, five, six... Pick up if  you're there. I've got major gossip...  major screwup. It could be good for  us. Is this the kind of crap you listen  to all day? If the TV show bombs, there's going  to be a dance party on my grave. I  don't give a crap. Nothing seems to  have a point anymore. I'm really  questioning everything... including  action-adventure... Don't tell anyone  I'm down. Even destroy the message  tape. Don't tell anyone I said to  destroy the message tape. Don't even  give hints that there's something  you can't tell them, but you wish  you could... I'm losing it. I'm losing  it. I'm losing it. Don't tell nobody.  Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody. Daddy... You dialed bad... Where is he? I'm sorry... Is there a name for what we just  had? This is awkward, my driving you around  and testing for you tomorrow. Not really. Well, I hope you understand I can't  drive you to work tomorrow and then  go in and test. It's just... Okay. I was going to come in late  anyway. I'll get one of the kids to  drive me. Thanks. And, look, if I get the lead  in this movie, you'll have to go  back to sitting up front with me. No sitter!!! Thanks. We're leaving  now. How many men are they testing today? Then tell them I need a little more  time. I mean for me. I want to focus a  little. You know who she was involved with  for a minute or so? Hey! You guys have to leave. This is  important and I need to be alone  right now... Wow. It felt great... Everybody... Anyway, the girl I did it with, by  the way, she's really good; the  director, the crew... they all thought  we nailed it. You wait here, Jeannie. I have to talk to you. What in hell is wrong with you? You  actually think... ...that you can have my kid audition  for a show without asking me. What's the part, anyway? How were they able to test her so  fast? Oh... A child actor. Just what any  kid with problems needs to straighten  out--a series of her own... You'll let me know as soon as they  see my test? Not if I don't let you. That's the  law, the police law. You're going to have to learn to  look at me and listen to me and the  longer I have to wait THE ANGRIER Me too. Just listen. Because I know about this. I have  worked with kid actors... They don't  have that much fun. They're inside  all day... they don't get to go to  regular schools or play with their  regular friends like Ricky and Essa. And their parents? You think I'm  going to be one of those parents,  sitting in one of those rooms, where  we all go crazy trying to jump start  our egos with our kids' sweat, all  the time smiling at each other like  our lives are working while we root  against everyone else's little girl? No!! No way! I can't! Pick it up, Jeannie. Let's work on it. So how do you think 'Ground Zero'  will do tonight? How do you think my movie will do  tonight? How bad can it be? We've got to have  at least a two million dollar Friday.  There's nothing else out there. I'm watching... Stop playing with that thing. What's wrong? Well, in that case, your dog died. I can't remember. You're too pretty. Oh, I told them I'd keep on being  Chairman. I'm Chairman, you know. Told them I'd keep on being Chairman  if they hired everybody back. Oh, that I was crazy. You always  wear your hair back like that? Okay, come on... let's have our  creative meeting right here. Well, I'd sure go to bed with her. Very fuckable. I'd sure fuck her. Okay... that's her... What about  him? You wouldn't want to fuck him? So you'd want to fuck him? A director can't make you hot if  you're not hot. You'll end up with  warm which is death. Let me ask you something... Would  you fuck him? Let me stop you before you embarrass  yourself. We all can do our little lectures on  what things boil down to. Everybody  else here was professional enough to  come out and say... I'd fuck her...  I wouldn't fuck him... and you're  ducking it... I want you to forget  the acting stuff and totally focus  on the issue. We do have some kind of responsibility  to the audience... You just saw his  screentest... so, if this is the  first time you saw the guy, do you  come out thinking to yourself and  your girl friends, 'I'd sure go to  bed with him; oh God, would he be  something.' Would you, Cathy?... I'm  being real here. Okay, so let's keep looking. Everything's okay... I'm sorry I  forgot to put you back on with Cathy. You have reached the Warner's Hotline.  Estimated Box Office Grosses for  Friday, December 3rd, Weekend Number  49, are as follows in millions of  dollars. Due to the high volume of calls, we  must ask you to wait till a line is  clear...

'Best Girl,' 1,820 theaters, six- point-four million, up 24 percent. Cappuccino movies. Opening this weekend, 'Double Dare  Two,' 1,870 theaters, fourteen-point- three million. 'Ground Zero,' 2,110 theaters, no  million, point four thousand dollars. I'm going to pieces... The picture was budgeted at 21 million  and I spent 49 so they were a little  mad at me to begin with. Now it  doesn't open even with an Arby's  Roast Beef tie-in... I mean, we only  averaged 300 dollars a theater...  they're going to think I'm Woody  Allen. I don't think you have to worry about  that. Thanks. But this is private. What  about the exit survey? Did we do  good with any group at all? Hi. Did we do well with any group at  all? I'll see you later. Goodbye. I'm all alone... At least there's that. Are you going to need me? The kids  are rehearsing and I'd like to take  a look. Yeah, sure. I have to stay inside  during lunch hours now anyway--that's  when everybody returns my calls  because they're trying to miss me. Is that true? Yeah. Thanks for the support. I bet I know what it looks like to  you. A giant "find Waldo." Five minutes, children, then we need  you for work on the set. That pretend living room, right over  there. Wait a second, Jeannie. Let Daddy  give you a few tips here. Parents to Room Two, please. Parents to Room Two, please. We have to clear the set. This way, parents. Hi. What do you think I did? I cried  like a baby. Now you got it. You ever go out with him? You slept with him? Did you hate it? Good Lord. She's very worried about being able  to pretend cry when she has to and  she doesn't get it about memorizing.  That's all. Not with that attitude. It's just that they... Well, did  they tell you what an audience is? Good. Now, because there's an  audience, they want you to know all  the words you have to say really  well. And since you can't read yet... ...you're going to have to be patient  and try hard. I can help you. Yes. I can. I can help make it okay. Trust  me. Not yet. Don't grab. Thank you. We really appreciate this.  Hi, Beth. I... Jeannie, your mom's not going to  understand what you mean. Why don't you let me be on your side  for a second? Do you know what trust means? It means that even if something is  hard to believe, you believe someone  you trust because you know he wouldn't  say it unless it were true. Yeah, I think you get the concept. I think you do. Just know that... You want to help me make a phone  call? Seven... two... Cathy. She's very nice. One... six... Hi... What now? How are you? You have to understand that sometimes  people are too busy. We look like jerks eating here this  early. Everybody's going to think we  couldn't get a reservation for the  hot hours. I'm not afraid of them. Normal. Isn't it something that they have  you testing the TV show? What are you talking about? Don't talk to me like this. She did okay... and don't worry about  Matt... If the pilot sells, his kid  will be making five thousand a week.  So what do you know about 'People  Get Hurt?' I knew. I knew. What the hell are  you smiling for? I can't be with someone who's not  rooting for me. Don't worry. I'm not that mad. I  gotta do this. Sorry. I thought you were someone  else. Nan, you know Victor and his wife... and Jay and his wife... Thank you. Thank you. We're very  close. Excuse me, we're working our shit  out... I'm sure it happened to you...  you know, private stuff in public. I hope that makes you feel a whole  lot better, Chile... 'Cause it sure  goes a long way to cure what ails  me. ...got in this much... Right. Over a... Yes. 'I can't believe I got in this  much trouble over a word.' Now do  you know what she means when she  says that? No. It's your choice... But I'm not  helping unless you try to understand  as well as memorize. It will be fun.  Come on. I know it's hard... Anything to shut me up, huh? Okay,  this little girl you're pretending  to be... she can't be with her Mommy  either, just like you, or her  father... she has to stay in Rainbow  House which is called that because... Jeannie... ...because everyone's a different  color... so when this little girl  calls the black lady who takes care  of all the children this terrible  word... it's like the worst thing  anybody can do... Come here. Yeah, I might have been working you  too hard on that one. Now, did the director tell you how  he wanted you to do it? Faster? Okay. We don't always get good  directors, so it's important for  us... I'm referring to the family of actors,  you little shithead. It's a breakfast burrito. It's what  actors eat when they're working. Now, let's work a little more. The  most important acting you do is when  you listen. You're worried about  being able to cry when you're supposed  to, right? Well, there are really only two ways  to do it. Think of something that  makes you really sad... or forget  you're you and really forget you're  pretending... 'Don't test me, child! I could eat  you for lunch when I was your age  and I'm a hell of a lot bigger now!' That's it... You just looked at me  and acted right without even thinking.  And there are games you can play to  help you with this. Get up... Now, be my mirror... do exactly what  I do... that's it... now, at a certain  point, I'm going to become your  mirror, but I'm not going to tell  you when... you tell me... Okay. We're going to make up words.  The words aren't what matter now. You're a great dad. You're welcome. Don't mention it. I'm a free man. Let's go to your  house and break the answering machine. I hope it's you. So this is how the big ones make  out. What's the matter? Yes. Yes. You didn't like what I did? That's what it came down to? You folded on whether or not I'm  sexy. You don't think I'm sexy...  and you expressed that to... No. You were just... Aw, damn it, I  am. Very. Yes. ...number seven at the box office  this week-end is... ...the two words are Tom Cruise. ...becoming the first lawyer to be  awarded his own star on Hollywood  Boule... Hello, Nan. I hope it's not too late  to call. I'd like another chance. See. Nobody else gets me. You wanna have a little sex, honey? Hello. Hi, Matt, this is Burke. I'm sorry  to bother you at home, but you know  Nan... We were going out a little  and I could use another guy's slant  on what's just happened. I don't think I can get into this... Why? Did I catch you at a bad time? Worse. You caught me at a bad time  you caused. Oh, you mean about the screentest.  The whole room thought you did good  work. Thanks. Yeah, look, I'm not going to bother  you about my thing. Yeah. Okay, good night. ...pilot for a new show called  'Rainbow House'. Just listen to our  band and I'll be back to tell you  more and make you love me... Jeannie. Just remember. You're not even here  tonight. There's only this other  little girl that you're pretending  to be who lives at Rainbow House. Great. Great. Wouldn't miss it. Hey, then they'll just give you more  chances after everyone leaves. Look at you. You're all here because  of what's on the line for me tonight.  Having this many people in your corner  helps more than I would have ever  guessed. I'm just very grateful that  I made you come. I don't want to miss her introduction. I've got to see my kid. Hey. Good. Oh, Cathy. Look, I'm going to watch  this. Let me talk to you later or  tomorrow. Thanks for your help. It's  good news. Gotta go. First, in her first appearance ever,  Jeannie Hobbs... Shit. Why couldn't you wait till later?  Shit. Huh? I think you're the best of the bunch. What do you think? Wait. This is it. The word is black. The word is African American. I had them bring in two busloads of  people from black churches. Now you use it in a sentence. Awwwww. Go ahead. Use it in a sentence. Look at me. I love a little redneck. You little stinker! My little stinker. It's okay, Jeannie. Take a minute.  We just need to get that hug at the  end. Amazing, right? You were great. You look happy. You want me to put you down? Okay... Now, you're not finished  until you hug the lady just like you  did me. I'm very proud of you. I love you  more than anybody. Give me a kiss. Do you have any idea how special you  were? That looks like a 'yes.' You've got  to get dressed for the party. Go to wardrobe; they'll give you  anything you want. This show didn't sell?!? How do you  know so fast? That they're not going to be doing  any more of these shows right now-- but... Honey... No. They're still having the party. Honey, we're going to close the place. Come on. You know how? I'm not comfortable with television  anyway... it's too small... I'm much  better at something with size... I  don't do itzy. Even this movie of  Cathy's--it's small... medium small.  But with Stone it takes on a certain  volume where I start to feel  comfortable. I hate my life... ...in a way. I had a drink in my  office. I'm confused. You're not  saying anything. Is it because you're  not listening or because I haven't  stopped talking? This Oliver Stone thing... does he  really want me? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I forgot to say  congratu... Which part? Which one you want? One of the two leads wouldn't be  bad. No. It's the crippled factory owner. Best part in the movie. Wait a second. I want to see my kid. A second--look, they're taking the  cast picture now anyway. She doesn't look anything like the  women I usually go with. And you  know what they say, "beauty fades."  What they don't say is that it fades  very slowly. You don't think I can tell you what  to do? No. Only I can do that. I want you  to tell me what to feel... Look. I trust her. More important,  everyone does. You have no idea how  impressed people are with her. She's  smart. She's interesting. You never  know what she'll say next... Her  work is amazing. I like talking to  her. You have no idea what to expect  next. I respect what she does more  than any writer or director--sincerely-- much more unusual--much more  important. So? Good luck. Dance with me. On a business basis. I'll take it. Nervous... Look, let's move our thing  in a more regular direction. Let me think. What if we go out this weekend... ...with your kid. Whose name is... Leslie. Well, I told you. I never got to see your bow.
