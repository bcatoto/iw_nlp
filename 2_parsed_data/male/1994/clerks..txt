This? How long have you been smoking? It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it. It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this. It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead. Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this. He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way. It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man. You think I'm shitting you... That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this. I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right? How long have you been smoking? Do you really want to buy those cigarettes? Are you sure? Are you sure? The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant! What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source! We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard! You're the disturbance, pal! And here... I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers. You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?! Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders. Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day." Okay. I'm sorry about that. No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks. You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work. This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that? How long have you been a smoker? Do you mind if I drink this here?Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man? I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him. Something smells like shoe polish. No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty. With this guy locked in? Then who operated the store? I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral. Wait a second? Who was working here today? What time was this?Pack of cigarettes. What's that? I'll just take the gum. Jesus! It's not the same. Well, if it's already too late... Unnhh! What's this? You're shittin' me. What the hell is that? What is this, a poll? Are you serious? Am I sure about what? Am I sure? Pack of cigarettes. Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper. She's marrying an Asian design major. Excuse me, do you have... This is the last time I ever come here. And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open! Well, he missed! I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF! "Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase." They print any kind of shit in these papers. Are you open? Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass. I can whip your ass. I'll assess all I want! How 'bout covering point!? You suck! Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass! What the fuck is this?! I want some service! Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder! Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive. Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired. This is the last time I come to this place. Pack of cigarettes. Are you open? Oooh! Navy Seals! You open? Cute cat. What's his name. I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit. Pack of cigarettes. Pack of cigarettes. Cute cat. What's its name? Are you open? Awww, he's so cute. What's his name? This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.Like I'm responsible for all the smokers! Yeah, but not in here. That's it, everybody out. You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance. I think you'd better leave now. Hey, now wait a sec... If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers. Maybe you should take that coffee outside. Fifty-five. Excuse me, but... Beats me. Sure. Go ahead. Thanks. Have a good one. There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin! Call the police. Are you sure somebody was back there? I'm not fooling around! Who went back there? I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside. No. I'm serious. Was it you? It wasn't me. Um... okay. Like what? I left like an hour ago. What happened to the walk and the nakedness? Who doesn't? He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note. I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back. I'm just kidding. So what are you saying? He's your fianc�. Sang. What about Sing? I hear that's a rather popular date. You have a better suggestion? Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie. Let me take you out tonight. So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating? Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market... I would like to be your boyfriend, yes. We could introduce them. They might hit it off. But can we date? So who's asking? I don't want to marry you. Jesus, you're caustic. I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed. You lie. Tell me I don't have something to do with it. There's more, isn't there? If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him? Sang? His name is a past tense? What? Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. But you were. And you came here to what? To comfort me? Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even. Thanks for the vote of confidence. How like her. No, you're not really getting married? So you're really getting married? How do you know that? Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is? And you said yes? You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend. Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation? What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child? Very dramatic, I thought. I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed. I can't believe you're here. Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home? My God. I haven't seen you since... When did you get back? She thought it was me. What about Caitlin? Well he asked me for it! Was he alive when... Caitlin... Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there. Nobody. It was closed. We did. Just me. Um... I don't know. What time did hockey end? I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom. So I'm told. To the back, above the oil. How long are you staying? I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even. Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me. They certainly do. Two fifty-five. My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working. Yes. That's easy to say from over here. Like you're better! Who are you to make assessments? I can pass! In a second! If you can just wait a few more minutes. We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away. Excuse me? Yeah. We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!! I'm not even supposed to be here today! You only brought one ball?! All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy. I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks. So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades. If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one. Get the fuck outta here already. To say the least. No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about. I'll call you. Let you know. I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica. Do you work tomorrow? You need a ride? You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank? You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today! Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores. Which means the video store is ostensibly closed. You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here. What time did you get to work today? What don't you do? Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable. Why do I say that? Randal... forget it. Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you. Jesus. Thanks. Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin? The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings. How's your neck? Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably. My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants. Jesus H. Christ, I can't! I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes. What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change. Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible. You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin. ...If I wasn't such a fucking coward. It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do. Leave me alone. Leave her out of this. Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store? Oh, like your life's any better? Leave me alone. As if it's that easy. What responsibility? Fuck you. What are you talking about? I should shit or get off the pot. I was born. My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit. I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks. Why do I have this life? This life. What time did we go to the funeral? WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP? WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM? Shut the fuck up! Could be. I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee. There's no lights back there. Who eats cock? I'll read the book. I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight. In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns. No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word. This is my way of spitting water at life. Watch the store while I go home and change. She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out. I'm not. She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother. I'm not. She just left. No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me. I'm happy. Because I'm happy. I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up. Because I'm here. As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here. Little girl. Maybe five years old? I don't; you did. Living proof. Five hundred dollars. I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor. And this is what you rented? What'd you rent? Best of Both Worlds? Please, get the hell out of here. You're a danger to both the dead and the living. What? Jesus! What the fuck did you do that for? That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything. Exactly. What? It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request. Can I help you? There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store. We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing. May I be blunt with you? Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time? You work in a video store! You want to rent a movie. Why should I loan you my car? I don't want to talk to you. Just... go! Go open the video store. Her fucking body fell out! Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose? You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes! I can't fucking believe you!! I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in. I know it was a bad idea to close the store. Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later. You know. I could never reach. He made it, hunhh? His dick was in his mouth? Who found him? Because I never tried to suck my own dick? No! Oh, my god. Stop it. Shut the hell up. That's embarrassing? How'd he die? An embarrassing way to die. Twenty-two; same as us. Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend. Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake. I can't close the store. I'm not taking you to this funeral. She meant nothing to you! Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store. You hate people. Stop it. This is beneath even you. You hardly knew her! You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this. Shit. What about tomorrow? What!? Why not? I'm gonna go to her wake. Number six. I haven't seen her in almost two years. Jesus. How? When? Oh, my god. Yeah, right. I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married. "It's not like we're gonna sell out." Exactly. They drank it all. Gatorade. Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up! One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball! We're not playing in the street. I don't know. You going to lock the video store? Can we not talk about this? At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here. I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to. I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault. Pull my laces tighter. You've got a customer. I can't believe I'm going to miss the game! Sorry. Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping. I'm going to miss the game. You know what pisses me off the most? I don't back down. I know. What? FUCK! Not a fucking word! Slippery shit! Can you believe this?! The best Burtless movie ever made. Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call. Shut up! Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal. Veronica! Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married. No. Which ones? The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade. The milkmaids. It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings. There aren't. What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them. I'm gonna hear it tomorrow. Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss. Can we talk about this later? What kind of show? I guess not. Nudie booth? What's a jizz-mopper? Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie. I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today. He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore. I told him that and he yelled at me. Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade. Each egg has to be perfect. He said he has to find a perfect dozen. This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look. Wait. All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction? Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at. So? And the second time around...? Basically. And you figured it out? Compliments of Lando Calrissian. Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due. Yeah. There's more? I think they were Catholics. More or less. It would stand to reason, yes. Yeah. I guess. How do you mean? The Emperor. What's that? Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets. Empire. Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married. Me pulling a can off some moron's fist. Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married! All four? I think it's safe to say yes. I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin. ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level. I'm talking to myself here. They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone. I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity. Because there was a lot of good in our relationship. It takes different strokes to move the world. The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep. Allan Harris. Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom? Great story, isn't it? She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party. I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson. She called me Brad. In the middle of it, she calls me Brad. Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me. Eight and a half. Five years. Seven months. You win. I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction. One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks. She called me. You don't want to know. Why? No, thanks. Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious. Shocking abuse of authority. Go open the sore. He assured me that he'd be here by twelve. That's what I said. Someone jammed gum in the locks. The boss called. Arthur fell ill. You're late. Jesus Christ, what next? THE GLADES MOTEL? You know him? You're Alyssa's sister? Heather? Caitlin Bree. Yeah? Do I know you? I don't have love handles. I know I can bench more than that! Thirty-fire. Yes. But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey! What? When? When did all this shit happen? I... I don't believe this... Wait a second! You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her? What? No, she's getting married. How do you know that? Yeah? Yeah. Oh for God's sake! I don't know. I am not. What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body. They are not. I don't think so. I didn't strain. I sighed. Excuse me? Meaning? She's my girlfriend. I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on. Maybe. Lasagne. Veronica. We were going to start again, I think. Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend. I don't know. I wasn't watching. He died in the bathroom. I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here. So. A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax. You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction. The difference is you exploit a weakness. It's not my store. How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here! Nothing personal. With you? I don't think so. I should start. A half hour. One seventy-nine. Done poisoning the youth for the day? How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store. Go open the video store. Are there any balls down there?! If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you. Actually, that's his night job. No; he was probably just resting his eyes. I'm sure he wasn't sleeping. Here. Now leave me alone. The porno mags? I said go ahead. You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there. Jesus... go ahead. Yeah, okay. Go ahead. Yeah, but... Actually, it is kind of rough. The white kind. Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler. Um... yeah, but it's for employees only. Oh... Can I help you? And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...? So I'm told. I'm trying. Veronica, I love you... Randal...? I don't want to go back with her... I don't want Caitlin... Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that... Would you let me explain... A couple...? It was only a few times... What're you talking about? What the fuck did you do that for? Sure. What time do you get finished? I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow. Thank you for the lasagne. ...it isn't there. Yes. And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen. At least he wasn't thirty-six. I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective. Really? You're the best. What is it? He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class? Thirty-seven. I just can't... Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys. I feel sick. Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?! A few? No, but you sucked enough dick! Hey! Where are you going?! Thirty-seven?! My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks! I'M THIRTY-SEVEN? What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me? WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX? Well...? This is different. This is important. How many?! HOW MANY? How many dicks have you sucked?! How many? I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said. Oh my God-I feel so nauseous... Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys? You sucked his dick! But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him! You sucked that guy's dick? Yeah, right. Like you said-she snowballed him. Sylvan can be talked into anything. He requested this? What do you mean? Why do you call him that? Shit! Why are we getting up? Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this. Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up? Where? All right. Name it. They put up the least amount of struggle. Animal, vegetable, or mineral. Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of. No; who were the three, besides me? Who? You've only had sex with three different people? Three? Do I get to hit you after you tell me? Why'd you hit me? What the hell was that for? Including you; yes. Twelve. Including you? How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once? How many what? These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me. It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization. I touched a nerve. Something wrong? A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent. Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge. Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat. Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there. How do you figure? Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me. Really? Why? You wanna have sex or something? I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off. Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched. Why do you say that? Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning. Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me? I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on. What? What is that? Who's defensive? Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged. Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now? Hunhh? Nothing. I don't know-like two-thirty, three. Bunch of savages in this town. Somebody jammed the locks with gum. I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in. Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep! The guy got sick and couldn't come in. I'm not even supposed to be here today! Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point. I hate this fucking place. Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me! A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go. I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure. I think it's coming now... Maybe we should soap your hand or something. You hold the counter and I'll pull. I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear! But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid! Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I didn't do that! What are you talking about? WHAT? What's this? Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about? I'm not out of shape! I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why? What? Yes. I'm not out of shape.Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead. Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work. I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch. You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too. What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller! You calling me a liar? It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.Screw you! Well this is the last time I ever rent here... You hope what feels good? I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying. I beg your pardon! I don't think your manager would appreciate... I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention. Well, how about these two movies? You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob. I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit. Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?" Damn. She sure goes out of her way. I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day? And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick? Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food. Don't you already have a girlfriend? You used to go out with her? Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her. Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh? That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off. Hey, man, what happened with that old guy? So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it? At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax. All right. How much is Pepsi here? What's that mean? And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them. Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit? I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude. Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers." Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man! We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out. You get high? Pay the good man. Don't you close soon? Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid. E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs. Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke! Drinking beers! A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed! I'm not dealing. Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk. 'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!! Wait, there's more. Olaf: sing... You gotta hear him sing. Olaf, "Berserker!" I don't know, man. He's a fucking character. Swear. Olaf, metal! He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do. I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying? Check this out, he's from Russia. Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin. Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum. English. Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy. Come on, man, "Berserker!" He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that. He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer. I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer? Olaf, what part of Russia are you from? I'll see you there. The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning. My man is deaf. I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY! Neh. Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party. For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash. That's the price, my brother.Yo. I'll see you at that party. I'll see you there? Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right? You're gonna be at John K's party? How long you gonna be here? Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.It stings a little. Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital. They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes. Usually I just turn the can upside down.Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one. Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties. No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter. Can I trouble you for one of those magazines? Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold. Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read? It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on. Thanks son, you're a lifesaver. Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough. Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff. I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony? Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there? I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent. Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom? No, he got hit by a bus. I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus. You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer. Be careful.Why? Nobody! I swear! I was here the whole time. You dog! I didn't see you go back there. He was? Am I missing something here? Territoriality. He was mine first. Hey Caitlin... Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal. And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on. Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store. Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night. There's no light back there. No, this is great. He went home to change for the big date. Exactly. Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right? Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around? Can I join in? Can I watch? Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante? Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore? I take it she likes the guy. Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree! What am I worried about? He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests. I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor. Yeah. Peptic ulcer. So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia? What's your point? Annoying Customer. I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie. Lenin's Tomb. Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right? All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent. I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it. Helluva day. All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain... You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here? Same time. What about you? Got one. Just pulled up. I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean. Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself. "I'm not even supposed to be here today." You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store. Badly, as well. You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us? We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced. Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here? Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together! It's not like I'm miles away. To talk to you. Like ten after. How do you figure? No, really. What did I do that was so wrong? Why do you say that? You still didn't have to choke me. You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out. I thought I was doing you a favor. You didn't have to choke me. It's hard to swallow. How's your eye? Lovely story. So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change? Who're you kidding? You can so. Make them change. Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement. What? The dead guy? She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad. Am I right or what? If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward... You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two! It's the same thing with Veronica. I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day. You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself. It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you? All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit. It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is. I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life. Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot. You should shit or get off the pot. That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is? Thirty-seven. Have some chips; you'll feel better. This life? What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem? I think four. Around three or something. She said she did all the work. You just fucked a total stranger? Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium? Fuck you. I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam. Bunch of savages in this town. Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time. All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks. You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this? You're a snake. Hey, what about Veronica? What happened to title dictates behavior? I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you? Wow. You've had quite an evening. You're kidding. What did she say? Now I know you're lying. You're happy to get a fine? You're happy? Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now? You're lying. Then how come you got the fine? Holy shit. That girl? Really? I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids. I didn't think they even enforced this. You're bullshitting. No way! I like to expand my horizons. Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame. Get to work. I know I'm your hero. I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny. If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice. Agreed? And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior. Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines. Not yet. The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right? So your argument is that title dictates behavior? You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale. I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure. If you must. Let me borrow your car. What's that for? I want to rent a movie. Fine. Just lend me your car. Let me borrow your car. So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something! So the casket fell over! Big deal! I was just leaning on it! It was an accident! I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault! Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday? Listen to you. I never tried it. What, your dick? Reach what? Yeah, but at what a price. Balls resting on his lips. My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess. No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it. Yeah sure. You're so repressed. Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick? I swear. Bible truth. He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick. Broke his neck. That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died. An embolism in a pool. She was pretty young, hunhh? You were saying? You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof! I'm going with you. She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died. If you go, I go. But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic? I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season. True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least. Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well? One night only. She's buried in the morning. Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four. It's today. No, you're not. You've had sex with a dead person. Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve? She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke. Embolism in her brain. Yesterday. Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning. No, I'm serious. Julie Dwyer died. You know what Sanford told me? After an exhausting game like that I can believe it. What happened to all the Gatorade? Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play. Helluva game! Then where're we gonna play? Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street? Are you gonna lock the store? Design major. He's blunt, but he's got a point. No argument here. Insubordination rules. I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy. At least we're stuck here together. See? There you go again. Don't yell at me, pal. Because you buckled. The fact that I'm right about your buckling? Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt. That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down. I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad. Why'd you apologize? So, what-you're stuck here all day? He didn't mention it when he called you this morning? Vermont? Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right? Thirty-seven! Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin... Why not? All of them. You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store. The milkmaids? Let's hear it. How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off? Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis. You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer. Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers. The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away. Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do. These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening. He's led a very sheltered life. Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks. Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth? He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off. You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour? It's not like you laid the eggs yourself. What did he say? Why doesn't he just mix and match? The quest isn't going well? Perfect dozen. What's he looking for? She's in here? You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said... All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with. All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius. You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living. Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main? All they know is killing and white uniforms. A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers. The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction. So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished. Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials. Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right. And the second one was still being built when they blew it up. Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it. So they build another Death Star, right? You know what else I noticed in Jedi? The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief. Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution. Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion. Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule. Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one. Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes? All right, Vader's boss... There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today. Blasphemy. Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back. Return of the Jedi. You know what I just watched? You, Veronica, Caitlin... ...and Caitlin's fianc�. Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over. Caitlin's on the same wave-length? What about Veronica? No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...? Oh shit, I've got to place an order. You think things would be any different now? Oh yeah. In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles. That's frightening. Chess team Allan Harris?! Your mother. That girl was vile to you. Oh, my God. What do you mean? That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom." She called you Brad? That's cheating? Eight and a half? Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times? Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin? I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now? I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree. What do you two fight about? Did you tell Veronica? You called Caitlin again? I wanted to use your car. Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour. Want something to drink? I'm buying. I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back. I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule. Is the Pelican flying? Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday. I tore up his membership. What smells like shoe polish? What time do you have to stay till? Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later. Bunch of savages in this town. Why are the shutters closed? What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one. You'll be missed. I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there? I hope it feels good. Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me. I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am. No, I wasn't. I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs. Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight? He didn't ask me to... You're not? Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante. I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave. Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory. Twenty bucks. I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape. Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape. Says who? You came for that too? That's the movie I came for. Which one? Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos! You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!Shit! I thought Redding had like three balls! Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major. What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey. What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish? So? Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day. An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours. It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child. You said you were here all day? According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor. A fine, for five hundred dollars. Here you go. Can I have your name please? Were you working here at about four o'clock? Excuse me, but have you been here all day? You open?Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old. Can I offer you a ride somewhere? Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you. All the time. That girl was like a rabbit. While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am. To you? Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her? And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey? Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body? Did you say Caitlin Bree? See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card. I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program. How much can you bench? No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise. Yes, they are. You're out of shape. Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized. I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape. I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds. Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym. I like the way you think. To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag! Holy shit! She told you about that! Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it. Really? Yeah! Shit! Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her. Because he's out of shape. It's probably from being around all this food every day. Now feel his. Roll up your sleeve, chief. Feel that. I do about three-fifty, four. I think the lady called it. He is. Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?All right, asshole, you're on. Twenty bucks? Like hell you are! Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs. I have first dibs. Dental School. I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall. I know. I've been here since eleven. The guy ain't here yet.Bye. That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right? Do you still talk to Sylvan? Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
