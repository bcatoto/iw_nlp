Come on... Just a little lower... WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on the lid of the closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over his head, is DARREN SHAN. Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent. Come on... I'll take good care of you. All the bugs you can eat. Hey, Darren! No answer. Steve walks along the stall, scoots low so he can see any feet in front of the bowls. Did you fall in? Darren! Shhh... Steve looks to the last stall, sees the jar being held up. INTERCUT from in and outside of the stall. You're gonna scare him away. Man, we're getting killed out there. It's three to nothing. Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little. Your problem, Steve, not mine... Steve gets a waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing his forefinger over the spigot, he turns the faucet. WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve directs into and then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up its thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling. The stall door opens. Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve who flashes a wicked grin... GOAL! Three to one! The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball. Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP! Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal. Three to two! Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult. What does that prove? Huh? The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them. Go get the ball. It's 3 to 2. Lunch's almost over. That's why he kicked it. To kill time. Well, I still got time to kick your face. Forget it. The ball. Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief. Thanks, Darren. He's crazy. Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak. Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street. From seemingly out of nowhere... A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out. It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS. You idiot! The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren. But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off. A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve notices, snatches it out of the air. Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear down the street. Creepy... Look at this. The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20 - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor. Human oddities and other living curiosities... Other. Does that mean not human? A freak show. Ever been to one? Just this school. Darren turns the flyer over. There are tire tracks on the back. They hear the sound of distant tire squeals, but the Lincoln is long out of view. Just an empty street now... Must be a different one. Steve scrolls down through pictures: I gotta show you something... I don't get it. Vampires. I've been studying them. Vampires? Darren looks at him a beat. Right. You're failing half your classes at school, but you're studying vampires. They been around 1000's of years. Two tribes. They even fight wars. What? When? Okay, sometimes, when humans fight? They fight at the same time. And no one knows it. Like at the Battle of Stalingrad they fought at the same time the Russians and Germans were fighting. Darren just looks at him, wonders if he's serious. Some people know about it. There have even been books written. He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag. That's your proof? It smells. Steve's really trying to convince him now. It's everywhere if you look. On the internet, in blogs, newspapers, weird places. But you can find it. The room starts to tighten a notch around them. I chatted online with one of them. Come on. Serious. We become aware of... What was his name? Mr. Dracula? Mad now, Steve opens the book, flips pages, finds an old 19th Century painting. He slaps down the science lab internet print-out of Larten Crepsley. It's the same guy! Maybe... Here he is in 1923. And here 1855. Huh? Maybe he'll be there tonight. Would that make you believe? As Darren looks them over, the POV looms up behind them. Suddenly Darren spins... And ROARS at what's behind them: his sister Annie. She SCREAMS in response. Steve jumps a mile. Darren LAUGHS. Saw your shadow on the floor. Gotta try harder, knucklehead. Steve snaps his book shut, shoves it in his backpack. I'm gonna get a soda. Get me one, too. Steve gets up, stomps out of the room. Sorry, Mrs. Shan. I wish I was. She's okay... She's been working a lot lately. A little frown of concern crosses Darren's mom. Something about Steve... His mom... He brings out a bottle of soda. I know. Darren's mom exits as Steve pulls down two glasses, starts to pour soda. As he waits for the foam to settle, he sees... The purse. Just there. A quick look around, it doesn't take him long to decide. Steve steps over, opens the purse. A quick rifling finds a wallet: $200 in $20's. He peels off three bills, shoves them in his pocket. BLLEEEP! A cell phone starts going off in the purse. Fumbling, frantic, Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the wallet, the wallet back in the purse, closes the purse -- Darren's Mom is back in. She's hurrying to get to her celiphone, so... Darren's looking through Steve's vampire memorabilia. Steve reaches past, starts packing it up. I gotta go. See ya tonight. Huh? Tonight where? He zips the bag, slings it over his shoulder. Cirque du Freak. I got no money right now. Don't sweat it. I got money. Meet me ten to Midnight. The Zeiterion Theater. That place is supposed to be haunted. Steve rolls his eyes, starts out... What am I going to tell my parents? Tell them you're sleeping over. We can meet early, walk over together. I don't know, man... D, it's Cirque du Freak. You wanna hear about it Monday? Or see it tonight? Steve lets his point sink in, then goes. We'll have to think about it. Whoever's eyes are the widest. And I didn't say no. Yet. As she tries to think through a new approach... Mom? I'm gonna sleep over Steve's tonight? Okay? What? Why not? I'm fourteen. I shouldn't even have to ask stuff like this. I've known him since I was five years old! But -- That's not fair! Stop arguing with her, Darren. Furious at his treatment, Darren gets up, stomps out. As Annie wonders if she should ask what's up... I came here after your house. There was a van there, guy selling tickets. (holds up tickets) Rest is history. They cross toward the ornate, albeit crumbling facade of the ZEITERION THEATER. Deserted, except for a few CANDLES burning on the sidewalk by a door. The wind moans. You know why they closed it, right? Years ago a kid fell out of the balcony and died. It's haunted. Get inside. They move toward a light at the end. Darren pauses at a darkened staircase. Headed up. He points it out to Steve... The balcony. Where he fell... May I help you? They wheel around, react to the sight behind them. MR. TALL. Gaunt, but oozing an elegant toughness. We're here to see the show. He takes an ominous step forward, then holds out a hand. He knew my name. Maybe he heard me say it. When they turn it, Mr. Tall is gone. Vanished. Ahead, a threadbare velvet CURTAIN. A low murmur on the other side. The boys exchange a last look, then push through into... He's as old as us. Evra starts to make a HISSING sound. In response, the snake begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back to look him in the eye. And then... Evra bends at the knees, lays down and starts to roll. Like he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears stage left. More applause from the audience. Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at the center. Everyone waits, but nothing happens until... Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant there's nothing under the spot and the next instant there is -- Recognize him. Can't believe their eyes. Steve pulls the print-out from his pocket, compares. It's him... Crepsley disappears! The crowd mumble nervously. And just as suddenly he's back! On the edge of the stage, lit by the footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE. Reacts. A spider! Crepsley makes the introduction. Have a million questions, but right now the performance has their full edge-of-their-seat attention. Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley's left shoulder. But... What happened to him?! Let's get outta here. No, you go. I'm staying. Steve starts down toward the stage. Darren follows. Wait. What're you doing? Steve reaches the stage, looks around. The audience is mostly exited; no one from the Cirque is in sight. As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his shoulder. Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat. This is my destiny. Don't ruin it. Steve looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands in surrender. Steve eases off, but he's still intense. That car today. It was a sign. Sending me here. I was told there'd be a sign. Too friggin' weird. Told by who? The guy in the chat room? The internet guy? I'll tell you later. If I can. Steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back. Darren stands, whispers into the dark. Steve... Decision time. Darren climbs up, starts after his friend. Steve...? No answer. Darren decides, starts down steep, rickety steps. Coming down the creaky stairs. Spooky. Steve... Turning a corner, is startled by what turns out to be a costume mannequin. But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it. The dust is tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a corner. Steve steps over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs up the wall, disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling. Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He sees... He's opened the door to the fridge. The little bulb inside pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up. Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face! The bars of her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he crouches behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as... Reaches in the fridge, takes out a glass jar that looks to be filled with BLOOD. Steve raises it, swirls it around inside. Are you looking for me? Steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- SMASH! Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY. Rooted to the spot. Watching... Crespley sniffs the air - the spilled blood to be exact. I -- I know who you are. You're a vampire. Moving slightly to get a clearer view. Crepsley suddenly DISAPPEARS, REAPPEARS much closer. Steve jumps, twists around. Unnerved. Nothing. No one. Crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him. I want to join you. I want you to make me a vampire. Not what Crepsley (or Darren) expected. Steve stands there trying to look resolved. Crepsley is surprised, intrigued. I don't care about living forever. But you do seem to live a long time. I already do. My father's gone; my mother doesn't care about me. I have a friend, but he doesn't understand. He's got too much to know what it's like to be alone. As Darren reacts to this... When you're alone you feel weak. Useless. But I know there must be something strong about it, too. I want to feel the power of being alone. I want to be a vampire. I don't care. Crepsley's actually impressed, but after a moment he waves a dismissive hand. Do it. Make me a vampire. Can't believe what he's watching. He sees Crepsley suddenly get 'scent' of something. Something to do with Steve's blood. Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steve's wrist, dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it. What's wrong? What do you mean? That's a lie. You take that back! Crepsley draws himself full, his voice deadly. Frozen to his spot, watches as Crepsley, seemingly ill, holds his head and spits again onto the floor. Then he steps over and kicks the fridge door closed. And in the blink of an eye, he's gone. Disappeared. Darren is alone. He starts out, then stops. Looks back. That beautiful spider. And Darren takes Madam Octa's cage and the whistle and makes a run for it. Just like that. Oh. You want that? Darren picks up the worm, lowers it between the bars. A beat and then Madam Octa snatches it away from him. Dinner. See? I'm your friend... You're so beautiful I stopped thinking. The wind rustles. Darren grabs the cage, continues. Get inside. From his angle, Darren's Dad can't see the cage in his son's hand. Darren hooks it over the end piece of part of the trellis and climbs in. Leaving the cage hanging behind. A freak show? Are you kidding me? It was down at the old Zeiterion Theater. Look, dad, I'm sorry. It's just, I couldn't resist. I -- You told me the other day you were broke. You were looking for a job to do around the house this weekend. Yeah? So? Where'd you get money for the show? Steve had money. Darren's Dad's suspicion is confirmed. Steve... We weren't going to tell you, but we think Steve stole money from your Mom's purse yesterday. He wouldn't do that. Mom's pretty sure about it. Man, what is this? You don't want me hanging around with him. Now you say you think he stole money? Do you know for sure? No. Steve's had some bad times lately. I'm trying to be a good friend. Being a good friend and sneaking out are two different things. I have to sneak out! You treat me like a kid! A moment as Darren's raised voice rings out of the room. Then act like an adult if that's how you want to be treated. This world is crossed by fences -- Darren interrupts. He's heard it a million times. I know, I know. And you gotta decide which side you stand on. And you can't sit on it either. His Dad doesn't enjoy hearing his words thrown back at him. He starts for the door, looks back before exiting. A freak show. What do they do, put people in cages for everyone to laugh at? It wasn't like that. A beat. Darren's Dad goes, closing the door. Darren sighs. He goes to the window, pulls up the cage. He scans a look outside. Except for his Dad, the coast is clear. Nothing a few years in prison won't take care of. Did you talk to Steve's mom yet? Darren's just snapped her photo with his DIGITAL CAMERA. As the door bursts open and Annie enters... Darren scrambles to block the cage from view. Annie, you gotta learn to knock. Out. Annie sighs, heads out. Darren puts the cage in the closet. Mom, this is the best omelette I ever had. His Dad can't help but smile. Good move. Mom is pleased, but knows she's being manipulated. As Annie stifles a laugh, Darren shoots her a look. A KNOCK at the kitchen door. Annie gets up, opens the door to reveal: Steve. From his angle he can only sees Annie. Hey, midget, where's the idiot? Annie motions Steve in. He stops short when he see everyone else. He recovers, does his best Eddie Haskell... Hi, Mr. Shan, Mrs. Shan. It's nice to see ya. As Steve gets several less than welcoming looks... What was that? Everyone acting like they don't know me. Did I walk in on something? Darren closes the door. Gets to the point. What happened last night? Nothing. I hung out in the theater for awhile, but no one was around. The lie hangs in the air a moment. Sorry about the way I acted. I'm sorry I pushed you. Don't worry. There's, you know, no bad blood or anything like that. What? I said don't worry. You said bad blood. I never heard you say something like that before. What are you, the word police? Steve gives him a look. A weird tension in the air. Darren glances at the bandage on Steve's palm, changes the topic. Wanna see that new game I got? Sure... Darren steps over, starts his computer up. While waiting, Steve sees the digital camera on the dresser, picks it up. I gotta get one of these. Steve switches it on. Something occurs to Darren too late... Let me see that -- On the screen: the PHOTO OF MADAM OCTA. Steve twists around to keep the camera out of Darren's reach. It's Madam Octa. I took it at the show. Liar. Look at the background. This got taken right on your desk. Darren's caught. As they just stare at each other. How'd you do it? They were loading a van outside. I, I just took her. Just like that... (after a look) You stole from a vampire you know? Just because he had a coffin doesn't mean he's really a... Darren trails off. Steve realizes Darren saw the coffin. You were there, weren't you? You heard what he said to me? That I was evil? I didn't believe it. Steve studies Darren, hopes that's true. I heard what you said to him, too. That you wanted to be a vampire. Steve doesn't want to talk about it. He looks at Madam Octa. How do you think he made her do what he wanted? Darren opens his desk drawer, pulls out the flute. I wish I knew how to play it. I think that was just for show. I think he used something else. Some kind of mind control. You mean telepathy? I bet anyone with a brain could do it. Which leaves you out. Steve smiles, gives Darren a little punch in the arm. The tension is loosening. They react to a KNOCK on the door. I swear to God, Annie... Don't move. Annie freezes. Darren grabs a BASEBALL BAT which leans in the corner. He reaches out, pokes at the curtain with it. Madam Octa drops down onto the window sill -- WHAM! Wood cracks as Darren brings down the bat, but Madam Octa is too quick. She disappears, leaping out the open window! Darren pulls it shut. He rushes back to Steve, turns him over. Steve's skin is already a deathly pale. Steve... Annie reaches out, takes Steve's hand. Get dad. Go. What kind of spider was it? I think some kind of a tarantula. Where is it? It got away. Darren's Dad holds up the camera. We have a picture of it. The doctor takes it as a NURSE meets the gurney. Anaphylactic shock. Get Doctor Lund. And we need to download a photo to poison control. This is as far as Darren goes. Steve is wheeled in, surrounded. Syringes are drawn, handed in. All we can see of Steve is one skinny arm hanging out. PUSH IN ON DARREN. Sick for Steve. Scared. Unaware that his world has only just started to crash down around him. If my son said he took that photo, then that's the truth. Dr. Lund just stares at Darren. Then: Hello? Where he stops short, sees in the center of the stage -- Crepsley's COFFIN. A beat and Darren steps up. He grips the lid, starts sliding it back. He looks inside to see -- Crosses don't hurt you? Because... you're evil. That's different. Bats are animals. Your spider bit my friend Steve. Crepsley shrugs, tosses Darren back his crucifix. He's dying. You have to help him! I'll pay you back. If it takes 50 years. Whatever it costs. There's something you want. That's why you're here waiting for me. Right? Crepsley's surprised and pleased by Darren's intuitiveness. He wanted to... become like you. I think so... I don't believe that someone can have bad blood. Me? Crepsley nods. You're crazy. There's no way. Destiny? That doesn't make sense. Not for me. There's gotta be another way. Please... He's my friend. You'd never be able to trust me. If I got a chance for payback I'd take it. How'd we get here? What's happening? He's my friend. Never met him. I don't think Steve ever did either. Why do you want to know? And then Steve comes around. He opens his eyes, focuses on Darren for a moment. He looks puzzled. Darren? And then he drifts off, asleep. His breathing growing deeper, steadier. Darren realizing he's going to be okay. What? Don't ever do that again. Annie's smile drops away. As Darren continues on... Hey, Shan, you gotta see this. They duck into the classroom. Darren follows. TWENTY or so KIDS all pressed around the Boa Constrictor tank. Steve holds court. .Doctor said it was a miracle. They say I'm unique -- Steve spots Darren as he steps up in the back. Hey, Darren. I've been looking for you. We got a lot to talk about. Yeah? But first... Steve holds out a fist. A MOUSE pokes its head out through an opening in the hand. Its whiskers twitch. As Darren looks from the mouse to the snake... Steve addresses the kids does his best 'Mr. Tall'. He tries to be entertaining, but he comes off creepy. Welcome to Cirque du Steve. What happens to us all can happen to any of us. If you watch, it's by your own free will. Say farewell... .to Crepsley the mouse. Darren reacts to the name. Steve lowers his hand into the terrarium. Some kids already look away, others are intent. Steve hesitates. Darren pushes to the front. It's cruel. It's nature. Anyhow don't watch. And don't blink; you might miss it. Steve sets the mouse in the terrarium. The MOUSE takes a few tentative steps. Moves toward a corner away from the... SNAKE who's suddenly alert. It raises its head, flicks its tongue. Coils back on itself. ZAP! The snake STRIKES... And Darren darts down his hand! CATCHES the snake just below its head, out of mid-air, out of mid-strike. Impossible! The snake twists in Darren's hand. The students are blown away. Steve's eyes narrow, his wheels are turning. The BELL RINGS. Moment over. Kids hurry out to class. What happened to the spider? I killed it. Steve hesitates, processes, looks Darren over. I had a dream. You and Crepsley were in my hospital room... Tell me about it later. Darren starts away. Steve grabs him hard, spins him around. I'll tell you now. Darren reacts instinctively, grabs Steve with his free hand and SLAMS him against the wall. Steve's nearly off the ground, only his left toe touching. I said later. Darren lets go, heads off. Steve watches, wonders. Got you something. Darren pulls the MOUSE from his pocket. Annie loves it, cups it in her hand. Annie SCREAMS as a GERMAN SHEPHERD charges, stops just short of them. GROWLING like it was rabid. Like it hates Darren. Darren steps between it and Annie. Darren's pupils dilate oddly; he curls his lip to show his own teeth. The dog starts to back off.. No it's not. King's my buddy. Come on. As Darren hurries Annie along down the street... The usual. Sometimes it was boring, sometimes really boring. Darren's mom laughs. Then... Standing at the blood's seeming siren call. But as he suddenly moves forward, she turns away. Darren stops as she wraps her finger in a paper towel. She looks back at him: misunderstands his hunger for concern. You're different... Hello? Hey! Crepsley appears. Darren turns, sees him. A beat. Crepsley raises his hands to the gloom around them. I'm starting to think it's me that's scary. Crepsley waits to hear more. It's only gonna get worse, isn't it? There's no way back, is there? No magic potion to make me human again? Crepsley shakes his head. Darren nods that he understands. We made a deal. I won't run away again. I can't just -- My family, I can't let them think I just left them. Or that something happened to me. My mother would... She couldn't... As Darren trails off, Crepsley really does look sympathetic. What? I'm going to bed. They say 'good night' to him. Impulsively, Darren kisses his dad on the cheek, then does the same to his mom. I love you both. I don't say it that much, but I do. Darren's Mom is caught off guard, but happy to hear it. Of course we do. Darren looks at them a beat, then smiles, satisfied. Good night. They watch him go, then exchange looks. Kids. Who knows how they think? Goodbye, knucklehead. If I can ever help you, I will. Shut up. Off Crepsley's reaction... This is my home and I'm never gonna see it again, so don't rush me. Crepsley makes a motion to zip his lips. All the same, he stands, unscrews the bottle as Darren takes a last look around. He takes a PHOTO of his family off the dresser. Hold onto this for me, okay? Crepsley takes the photo, offers Darren the bottle in return. Darren sniffs, recoils at the foul smell. You're sure it will work? Crepsley opens the window. What if I break bones? And the funeral home? Won't they embalm me or something? My dad's allergic to grass. It's my job to cut the lawn. So this is destiny, huh? Tastes like crap. Darren body seizes up. He lets go, but Crepsley grabs him. No, no, come on -- The Neighbor stops short as he sees the body. Hey -- Hey, kid -- He rolls Darren over, realizes something is very wrong. Darren? Darren! A moment later his Mom... Is he dead? Cause of death is trauma from the impact of the fall. Poor kid. Are we doing an autopsy? I'm not going to cut open a kid. Not when I don't have to. For the next life, Shan. Top right corner every time. Annie steps up, gently strokes her brother's cheek. Then suddenly overwhelmed, she buries her face in their Dad's chest. He leans in tenderly over his son. Choked up: I love you, Darren. You said it the other night; I didn't say it back. Steve holds Darren's eye open, shines a PENLIGHT into it. The pupil doesn't dilate. Footsteps approach. Steve switches it off, pockets it as the FUNERAL DIRECTOR enters. I'm sorry. I know it's difficult, but visiting hours are over. Steve nods sadly, looks to Darren. He pats one of Darren's hands which are folded across his chest. In reality Steve checks Darren's fingertips. A WHITE SCAR at the end of each one. Steve's crazy idea may be confirmed. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to come... Darren's Dad tosses a handful of earth down onto the coffin. My legs are asleep. What are you doing here? (smiles; closing in) Vampire hunting. Steve rushes the last step, a jagged WOODEN STAKE held high over his head. He knocks Darren back on the ground. Pouncing on top, he brings down the stake. Darren catches hold of Steve's wrist. Stops the point of the stake just over his heart. Steve puts his weight into it. A desperate moment of struggle, but Darren's strength is resurgent. He throws Steve off. Steve rolls to his feet, comes at him again. Darren catches his wrist with one hand, his throat with the other. He slams him up against the mausoleum, holds him there. What do you have against vampires? You wanted to become one yourself. Yeah, I wanted to, but you did. You stole my dream. You stole my destiny. Are you crazy? I did it to save your life. That was the deal. Me for you. Liar. You told him I was evil. You planned this all along. And you'll pay! You'll pay -- Darren jams the stake under Steve's throat. That stops him struggling. The points jabs him as he swallows. I want you to leave... Steve is just beginning to realize how strong Darren is now. I want you to leave and forget you ever saw me. Understand? Scared, he nods. Darren shoves him away, brakes the stake in two. Steve heads away, looks back over his shoulder. I'm going to hunt you, Darren. You and the other one. Crepsley. I'll put a stake in you and burn you to ashes. I'll make sure you never come back from the grave again. WHAM. Steve walks right into Crepsley. He picks Steve up by the shoulders, pulls him close. With a voice like Death... Would a stake through the heart kill a vampire? Before what's over? Let's go. As it blisters up into, then rises above the horizon. Sunrise. Ominous if you're a full vampire. How's that? Dark enough? (on the other side) Better. It's sunrise. I know the time. I know more about the sunrise than anyone alive. Maybe I'll wait until noon and then open every door and curtain in the place. A long tense silence as Darren awaits Crepsley's reply. Crepsley is a shadow among the shadows. He climbs into bed. Minnesota... Darren jots this state down on a LIST he's keeping. About twenty state license plates so far. I don't understand. But altogether you're 211 plus 20. You're really 231 years old. Where do you keep your car anyhow? The one you were driving around my town in. The old black one. It was near school one day. It followed me home a few days later. I couldn't see who was driving. What? Watch from a dumpster by the loading dock. She walks right toward them. One look at Crepsley's face and we know he must be willing her over. Darren looks terrified. But the air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared. The woman steps up, stops across from Darren. As she frowns, tries to figure out who he is and how she got here... Go. Run. But Crepsley appears beside her. He 'breathes' into his hand, 'guides' the air into her face. He catches her as she passes out. Darren is horrified. Did you kill her? Will she become a vampire? Don't take too much. What others? But as blood oozes, he takes the woman's wrist td his mouth. Darren is repulsed, but can't look away. Crepsley takes a few deep swallows, then holds the wrist out to Darren. No. I won't. I'll never do it. Crepsley runs his tongue over the cut, rubs the saliva in. I'm only half-vampire. I'll die first. What is it? As the woman starts to stir... Something out there scares you. What is it? The blood... I wanted it. I wanted to drink it. Thank you. Darren turns to face the window as he wipes his eyes, nose. Then he sees it: parked across and down the street... A black 1966 Lincoln Continental. Darren looks back at Crepsley. The car... Crepsley follows the finger as Darren points. DING DING! The bell over the diner door rings... Darren knows trouble when he sees it. He looks back at Crepsley, but the vampire is gone! Vanished. Darren Shan, we meet at last. Darren just looks up at him. The guy is practically leaking nastiness no matter how avuncular he tries to be. Where'd you hear that? Who is? See what? The air seems to buzz as something 'passes'. It's behind us! Crepsley bears down, the buildings streaking by. But... Hey, man, are you okay?! He stops short when he sees Murlough's face. Murlough stands, SWATS the driver aside. The Lincoln screeches to a halt alongside him. Murlough climbs in. The Lincoln tearing away. It goes black except for a glint in Crepsley's eyes. He sighs, settles down on the ground. Worn out. Are you okay? Who were they? Vampires? How dangerous can a man named Mr. Tiny be? Then what is he? And the purple guy. What was he? Yeah? Keep talking. But some didn't? What? That's crazy. Oh yeah... This is so much better than where I used to be... Crepsley hears the strain in his voice. Knows what's best for both of them.. Half vampire. I liked it better where I was. Do you eat mice? I caught your act in the last town. Pretty cool. Snakes can catch cold? Evra nods, then SNEEZES himself. Who are they all? How did they end up here? Cirque is French, right? Are you guys French? Oh, I'm Darren. I snuck out to see it once, too. And I'm still here. An odd, almost spooky moment. Is he serious? Good one, Darren. Hey. Debbie and Darren. Like Bonnie and Clyde. And their friend Evra Von what? That breaks the moment. Debbie starts climbing the re-bar. Sam looks Darren over a beat, picks a thread off his lapel. Dude, it looks like the kind of suit you'd wear to a funeral. You have no idea... Evra smiles, sticks out his tongue. Pointy, narrow, Evra sends it up his own nostril. Sam tries to smile, then starts up after Debbie. Freaked out. As Darren and Evra laugh... Darren and Evra watch from the back, whisper to each other. How long have you known Mr. Tall? How do you meet someone like him? Darren... Darren turns. Crepsley's back there in the shadows. Darren sees Debbie who gives a little wave. As he smiles... Blazing in the Cirque campgrounds. The freaks are eating, drinking wine, relaxing after the show. Like a gypsy camp. Mr. Tall sits with his long legs up on a box, really enjoying watching everyone else enjoy themselves. Evra munches on a sausage he grills on the end of a stick. Darren is all ears and eyes. He likes these people. And he's certainly never experienced anything like this. Someone starts to play a guitar, someone else beats a drum. Madam Truska starts to dance, the fire flickering against her as are all eyes. Then she reaches out, takes Crepsley by the hand. A few moments later, the two of them are engaged in a mad TANGO. It takes the camp's collective breath away. Even Darren can't help but enjoy it. Crepsley's arm gives him a twinge or two, but only Truska notices. Almost done. Crepsley looks to the sky. Still dark. The moon setting. I just felt sick for a second. You think Mr. Tiny might come? Crepsley shrugs, doesn't answer. Who is he? What does he want? Can't you give me a straight answer just once?! No. I never thought about it. I'm not a child. Theystop by the shadows. I'm in between. And old vampires? Without a sound, someone has reached around the two of them from behind, a RAZOR-KNIFE held to each of their throats. They stand dead still. We can make out the shape of a head as whoever it is leans in ever so slightly from the dark. We'll call it a draw then. The 'voice' pulls back his knives, steps out. It's GAVNER PURL. He was once handsome, but those days are long gone. His face is crossed with scars. They vary in size, thickness and color. Gavner is a warrior, carries himself so. You guys are friends? Like roommates? To save money? Who was hunting you? He tried to kill us. What are you guys talking about!? No answer as Crepsley and Gavner lock each other in a look. I won't drink blood if that's what you mean. I promised myself. You'll get insulted. As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him... I'm afraid if I drink blood, I'll become evil. Gavner LAUGHS out loud, catches himself. That's how it would start. I would swear it was just to stay alive. But what'll I turn into? You're on one side of the fence or the other. My father used to say that and now I know what he meant. The 'father part' chokes Darren up a bit. Why did Crepsley make himself an exile anyhow? With the vampaneze? You've known him a long time? Why'd he choose you? Is it why he chose me? Gavner hesitates, not sure. The vampaneze? Mr. Tiny? Lucky for me. Glad I could help. All the same Darren considers what he's heard. Gavner, meanwhile, considers the open countryside ahead. That part is definitely cool. Nothing. Don't know. I'm congested. Hey... Evra follows his gaze, turns just in time to see: Exchange a look. Start after them. Must've been a long time ago. Hey, we loved the show, man. It was off the hook. Are you guys on your own? Just traveling. No parents or nothing? No. No parents. He says it with a little twinge that Debbie picks up on. School? You're the luckiest guys on earth. Wanna switch places? You have to be different to be here. He's a snake-boy. You could say you're dermatologically challenged. They all LAUGH. Debbie considers Evra a beat, then Darren. I get scared easy. Darren looks up toward the rafters. From where she dropped. How'd you get up there anyhow? Don't worry. She's like a gymnast. Debbie moves slowly at first, her arms stretched out for balance. Then she does a hop, a skip. Darren and Evra gasp. She gets to the other side, turns and bows. You're crazy! I got nothing to prove. Why's that? Darren crosses his arms across his chest. No big deal. What's that? Is Sam your boyfriend? Oh... A funny, awkward beat out on the rafter. Finally... We should get off this. She nods, a bit smitten. Darren turns. As they start off... Chalk it up to lack of blood, but everything starts spinning. Darren legs go out and he falls off. As Debbie screams... Darren CATCHES HOLD of the rafter just as he drops past it. I don't think it'll hold you, dude. (shakes it off) It's okay. I'm okay. Darren swings up a leg, hooks it over the rafter. A beat and he's back on top. Debbie relieved. Evra backs up the way he came and in a few seconds they're all safely off the rafter. You wouldn't have fallen in the first place... I just got dizzy. She's kind'of cool, huh? I mean, for a girl. She's just curious. What makes you such an expert? What's good about it? Crepsley looks him over, doesn't like what he sees. He stops as Sam and Debbie catch up with him. Hey, Darren. Hi... Darren's happy to see them. You guys are coming to the show again tonight? Oh, you came to see Evra. I was hoping for Amanda Bynes. Darren sees Crepsley watching him from the tent. Hey, I'll catch up with you later. I got some stuff I gotta finish up. He's gonna be gone in another day or two. Tonight's the last show. So stop looking at him like you love him. Darren joins Crepsley, a little unsteady. I'm fine. No! I won't let you hunt some poor person down for me. I -- Crepsley grabs hold of Darren, hauls him into... Dark, the inside walls richly embroidered. Medieval. No. I can't. I'm human. Crepsley releases Truska's arm. I am human. In my heart I am. A great big TEAR rolls down Truska's cheek. That's the last thing Crepsley needed to see. He's defeated. An usher in the house of usher. And I can't seem to find a seat. Darren frowns at the odd voice, but leads down the aisle. This way. Darren brings him down to a handful of seats. The figure looks up from under the brim of his hat. It's Mr. Tiny. I don't think so. As Darren moves to go, Mr. Tiny clamps a hand around his wrist. Like iron. He sits, pulling Darren down beside him. He said you can't be explained. You need to be experienced. Cuz we miss you so much. She digs Sam with her elbow. They sit just a row in front. Choosing sides can only lead to trouble. Never, ever choose sides unless it's your own. You've chosen the vampaneze. Mr. Tiny laughs, slaps his knee even. Terrible profits. What prophesy? I think you're a creep. I think you suck. Forget about her -- Murlough takes hold of Darren's other wrist. Still low: You guys are in trouble. There's more than one vampire now. Gavner Purl is here. Murlough reacts to the name. Does not like it. Crepsley! Look out! The audience LAUGHS. Like Darren's worried about Madam Octa. Debbie looks back, knows something is wrong. Sees Mr. Tiny's hand around Darren's wrist. As Murlough 'appears' alongside Crepsley. Madam Octa's cage drops to the stage as Murlough knocks Crepsley fifteen feet through the air. He lands flat on his back. The audience CHEER! Think it's part of the show. Murlough reaches into his jacket, produces a razor-sharp LONG KNIFE in either hand. Crepsley pops to his feet. As his own single BLADE 'switches' to life in his hand... CHEERS as Murlough charges forward, the long knives pinwheeling in his hands. His attack is brutal and blunt. Crepsley is driven back, parrying each thrust and attack as it comes. Sparks fly as the blades connect. From out of nowhere, Crepsley adds a BACKHAND to the mix. It catches Murlough hard across the chops. Mr. Tall and Evra watch. Not knowing what to do. Murlough swings back wildly. Crepsley catches the blade in Murlough's left hand with the one in his right. Crepsley catches Murlough's left wrist, the second blade dangerously close to retracing the scar on Crepsley's face. Crepsley throws himself back, sending Murlough head over heels across the stage and SLAMMING into a concrete wall. Concentrating. Trying to flit. Murlough rolls to his feet, charges. It's brute force versus style. But as Crepsley moves to sidestep, Murlough's not so brutish after all. He matches the move -- Buries one of his knives into Crepsley's stomach. Crepsley reacts, frozen in shock. Darren reappears, leaps onto Murlough's back, knocks him off target. As Murlough staggers right, Crepsley staggers left. Murlough regroups, charges after him. Badly hurt, stumbling, Crepsley falls off the edge of the stage. Disappears. ROARING, Murlough grabs Darren. They disappear as well. He doesn't care about me. Steve? Steve! Steve holds up his hands so Darren can see the WHITE SCAR on the tip of each finger. He gets closer. Mr. Tiny made my dream come true. Only better. I'm half vampaneze instead of a stupid half vampire. Mr. Tiny says I have a destiny. He says he's gonna make sure of it. Is that who you talked to? Was that the internet guy? Mr. Tiny? Pretty funny, huh? He introduced himself after you left town. But, I think I've known him a long time in my head. In my bad, bad blood. Chilling. Maybe Steve is evil. He leans in even closer. He gave me back the dream you stole. Murlough motions Steve quiet, slaps a hand over Darren's mouth. Listens. Smiles. Whispers. Where'd he go? They jump as Crepsley appears right in front of them. Evra knows it's useless. As he nods, Crepsley turns and strides back toward where he had been. Sam and Debbie exchange a look. What the Hell? What are you gonna do? Crepsley speaks to 'the room'. Let's get readyyyyy to rumble! Crepsley looks up, reacts. Has lost sight of them, he can only hear the battle now. He reacts as Evra, Debbie and Sam rush out. Evra takes hold, lifts, tries to lessen the load on the chain. Are you guys nuts? Get outta here! Evra. I think I'm dying. He looks horrible. Ooops... Steve lifts the latch. Even he doesn't expect the force the wolfman hits the door with. Whaanngg! It's out. Evra steps bravely forward. The wolfman sends him flying. Sam can't hold Darren up by himself. He doesn't even see the Wolfman leap over. As Darren sinks to the floor... The wolfman tears into Sam... He's more surprised than shocked. Until the wolfman looks his way. Then he heads for the hills, disappears into the dark. The wolfman turns back toward Debbie. She backs away, takes off up a rickety stairway. The wolfman HOWLS, then follows. Darren's too weak to follow, near tears in frustration and regret. He watches after them, then he looks over at Sam. Sam who is dying. Just a few feet away. His eyes flicker to Darren's. He tries to say something, but can't. Oh Sam. Oh no... Darren crawls over, takes Sam's bloody hand. Go save Debbie, Darren... Sam manages the smallest smile. As his eyes drift shut... I think she loves you... From above, we hear Debbie SCREAM. Darren considers Sam's blood, knows what he has to do. Leave his humanity behind and cross the line. He needs to drink Sam's blood. Forgive me, Sam, but I need strength. I need blood. As Darren extends his nails over Sam's wrist... We're going to save her together. Is Crepsley dead? What can I do? Murlough, looming over Debbie, smiles as Darren arrives. Let her go. Stop being a big shot. This isn't like stopping some fight at school. Shut up, Steve. The audience who remain chanting: "Refund! Refund!" They react as debris falls from above, smashes to the stage. SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough descends. Somewhere in mid-fall, Crepsley FLITS, disappears. When Murlough hits the center of the stage, he hits it alone. Dead. As people start for the exits, we see Mr. Tiny'is among them. But as Darren stands, it's not over. Steve grabs Debbie, pushes her to the edge where the rafters are. Stay back! Or I'll throw her off! I mean it! It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie. She looks back. Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS. Understanding, Debbie tears herself away. To the precipice. But instead of falling, she continues out on a rafter. Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her, she deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor. Before Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them: rows of jagged, rusty pipes. The remains of a pumping station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting to impale. It's over, Steve. Is it? Steve lunges. They come together, trading shots, stumbling but still having to make the rafters. A missed footfall will be their last. They separate, try to gain position. You wanna hear something funny? After your funeral, I went to see your parents. They continue circling. And they were fine. They acted like they barely remembered you. Liar. And your sister. She was moving into your room. They had a yard sale. I bought some of your stuff. Steve's foot on his hand. Darren about to die. Oddly: Did you steal money from my mom's purse? What? Did you? Darren hanging there, dead grim. Steve's curious. Why do you ask? Is knowing that gonna help you rest in peace? No. It's just practically the last thing that ever happened between me and my dad was I was arguing with him. Least you had a dad to argue with. A fury building in Darren. I was telling him he was wrong about you. That's the last time we had together. Fighting about you. Hate to tell ya. Your dad was right. How do you think we got the money for the dumb tickets? I took it. Just like I'm gonna take you. Steve jams his foot down into Darren's face, but Darren hangs on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up, no matter how many times Steve hits him. I miss him. Do you understand? I miss him so much. WHAM! Steve's arm pinwheel for balance. He's going over. But just as he pitches off the end rafter... Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will fall into the spikes below. Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should do. No. He used to be my friend. Darren flings Steve back the other way. To safety. Start running. Don't ever stop. Steve hesitates. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Darren starts off the rafter toward him. One last look of hate. Next time... And he's gone. Disappearing into the dark. Darren joins Debbie. Nothing left to hide. Are you gonna be okay? You think I made a mistake, don't you? Half human. What now? There's a war on, isn't there? Crepsley shrugs. This world is crossed by fences. You have to decide which side you stand on. It's not gray. I've met the bad guys. They need to be stopped. But you said it. There's no in between. And the power of being alone is never going to be greater than the weakness. It's our fight. He was a good kid. It's weird, but I remember things about him even though I wasn't there when they happened. Even though it's impossible. A moment as Crepsley nods sadly at this most singular boy. He didn't die in vain. A beat. You never know. As she hugs him tight, she whispers in his ear: Hope is a good word. I hope so, too. And so goodbye. Darren and Crepsley start down the road. Where are we going? So what are we waiting for? Let's go. Crepsley offers his hand.
