How much does your life weigh? Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... You feel them? (gives us a beat) Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things. The stuff in drawers and on shelves. The collectables and knick-knacks. Feel the weight as it adds up. Now, start adding the larger stuff. Your clothes, table top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV. That backpack should be getting pretty heavy at this point - Go Bigger. Your couch, your bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in... Your car, get it in there... Your home, whether you have a studio apartment or a two story house, I want you to stuff it into that backpack. Now try to walk. Kinda hard, isn't it? This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis. We weigh ourselves down until we can't even move. And make no mistake - Moving is living. Now, I'm going to set your backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it? Photos? Photos are for people who can't remember. Drink some gingko and let the photos burn. In fact let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. (a beat of emphasis) It's kind of exhilarating isn't it? That is how I approach every day. Excuse me? Do you want the cancer? Oh... No. Um, no thank you. Who the fuck are you? What did I... do? What could I have done differently here? This is not an assessment of your productivity. It's important not to personalize this. Steve, I want you to review this packet. Take it seriously. I think you're going to find a lot of answers in there. Oh, I'm sure it's going be really helpful. Look, anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it. I'm going to need your key card. Right... Take the day. Put together your personal things. Talk to your co- workers. Tomorrow, go out and get some exercise. Go for a jog. Give yourself routines and pretty soon you'll find your legs. Wait, how do I get in touch with you? Don't worry. We'll be in touch soon. This is just the beginning. Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham. Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham. Ryan Bingham's office. You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City. They are completely out of all full sized sedans... Did you?... (not the first time) Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable #1 Gold Club status and years in the program. They are moving mountains to see you in a Sebring. Fair enough. Any other messages? Your sister Kara called. Needs to speak urgently about your sister's wedding. I told her you were midair and not even I knew your final destination. Well done. And you got an invitation to speak at GoalQuest in Vegas. GoalQuest twenty? It's got a hologram. They're calling it Dos Equis. That's some pretty major Tony Robbins shit there. Talk about burying the lead. I'll check in when... Hold on, I have Craig Gregory for you... I... ah, fuck... How's the road warrior? Twenty minutes from boarding into a world of bliss. Great numbers out of Phoenix. You know Big Auto is going to drop another 10K this month. No kidding? Yeah, Christmas came early. Wish I could have you in five places at once. I need you back in Omaha by the end of the week. I thought you needed me everywhere. I don't know why you ever bring me in. Wherever I go, the money follows. Let me plant seeds, they'll grow to Oaks. I'm thinking of planting seeds right now. What are we talking about here? You'll see. Today, I took my first crap in two weeks. Hallelujah. That's me, hanging up on you. Good. I love that sound. Hello? Hey Kara. Just fine. You? The kids? Couldn't be better. Yeah? You're satisfied with Maestro? Yeah, I am. They're stingy with their miles. I like Hertz. Hertz keeps its vehicles too long. If a car's over twenty-thousand miles, I won't drive it. Maestro doesn't instant check out. I like to park and go. Hertz doesn't guarantee Navigation. Funny, you don't seem like a girl who needs directions. I hate asking for directions. That's why I get a Nav. The new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad. Is that a joke? Yes. Their kiosk placement is a joke. Never have available upgrades. It's basically a fleet of shit boxes - Don't know how they're still in business. (I love you) I'm Ryan. Alex. So are you going to join me? (grabs one of Alex's cards) Maplewood Card? How dare you bring that into this palace. Hilton offers equal value and better food - But the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check in. They got you with the cookies? I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality. There's actually an industry term for that. It's a mixture of faux and homey. It's faumey. (holds her hands eight (extends a few inches) Let's just say I've got a number in mind and I haven't hit it yet. This is pretty fucking sexy. I hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship. We're two people who get turned on by elite status. We may have to settle for cheap. There's nothing cheap about loyalty. I really have to start throwing these out. We can always use that room with the ice machine. Good call on the towel rack. Thanks. I liked how you burritoed me in the sofa cushions. I was improvising. Too bad we didn't make it to the closet. We got to do this again. I'm in Newark on the 12th, Madesto on the 13th, Oklahoma City on the 15th. Any Southwest? I'm swinging through Albuquerque the week of the 16th? No, but I'll be in Florida by the 20th. Miami? Ft. Lauderdale. That's nothing. Forty minutes. I should probably go back to my room so I can wake up in my bed. I think that's the lady like thing to do. Ryan? (doesn't know his name) Hi... Feels like it's been months, busy man. We missed you at our Summer party. Yeah, sorry I couldn't be there. We've been trying to get a vote on the new landscaping. Can I e-mail you the plans...? We'd love to get a final tally. It's fine. Really. I'll go with the majority. Sometimes I forget that you even live here. You could probably save money and move into a hotel. I looked into it, but the IRS requires a permanent address for employment. Otherwise, they classify you as a vagrant. Oh. Hey yourself. Thanks. Hope it wasn't a bother. It's my sister. She's getting married. Haven't met the guy yet. I know, right? Hey, you want to come over tonight? Oh, that's... that's great. That's okay... I' think I'll settle in. Just thrilled to have everyone under one roof. Welcome home boys. 25. (from a script) I don't understand. I'm fired? That's my fucking line. Well, what happens now? Yeah, but, how does it work? I understand. Thank you. Tell me you're not taking this seriously. Yeah, that's why we brought the entire company in from the road - Because we're not taking this seriously. It doesn't make any sense. It's... ... completely impersonal. Who am I even talking to? There's a methodology to what I do. A reason why it works. Ryan, Coke and IBM have been doing it for years. Just like anything, there's a few months of transition, but everyone settles in. Who are you taking off the road? You don't get it. You're grounded, Ryan. Everyone is. It's done. Okay, what we do here is brutal and leaves people devastated, but there's a dignity to the way I do it. Stabbing people in the chest instead of the back? Yeah, why don't you come in. Great job in there, Nat. Look, I appreciate your... zeal. And you have some good ideas. But you know nothing of the realities of my job. Sure, you can set up an iChat... but you don't know how people think. Nice. Okay kiddo, fire me. Ryan, stop it. She's going to be doing this on a regular basis. You don't want to know if she can fire somebody? She just fired Ned. My dog could fire Ned. Fire me. Ryan. Who the hell are you? My future? I don't know you. The only person who can fire me is Craig Gregory. Handle what? Handle me? Mr. Gregory hired me and he's the only one who can fire me. I'm going to talk to him. You can't follow me... You're on a computer screen. Remember? Try again. Fire me. Actually, you didn't. Now, fire me. Stop it, Ryan. I'm fired? Never say fired. Why? You never know why. Why doesn't matter. I'm going to spend my energy on suing you if you don't give me a reason that you're firing me. Oh, so you're firing me without grounds. Now, I really have a lawsuit. Ryan, I think we know what you're trying to say... Personally? (quiet and calm) This is the most personal situation you will ever enter. So before you try to revolutionize my business, I'd like to know that you actually know my business. Hell-of-a-way to welcome her to the team. Am I the only one who sees that by automating our own business, we're making ourselves irrelevant. (frankly...) No... We're making you irrelevant. Watch yourself, Ryan. You're too young to be a dinosaur... I'm not... I'm not a dinosaur. I want you to show her the ropes. What do I know about what happens around here? Have Ferguson do it. I'm not talking about here. No. Hey, you seem pretty confident that this girl doesn't know what she's doing... Excuse me. I just don't think a MySpace page qualifies you to rewire an entire company. Great. Well, here's your chance. Show her the magic. Take her through the paces. I'm not a fucking tour guide. (re: his hand) This is the boat. Yes. Alone. Ryan, we're ringing the bell. Rounding everybody up. If you want to stay out there a little longer, you can. But you're not going to be on your own. (begins to leave) Let me know. Huh. That's exactly what it is. Luggage. (off of Natalie's look) You know how much time you lose by checking in? Thirty five minutes per flight. I travel two hundred seventy days a year. That makes one hundred fifty seven hours... That's Seven Days. (points to her luggage) You ready to throw away a whole week on that? Bingo. Asians. Never get behind people travelling with infants. I've never seen a stroller collapse in less than twenty minutes. Old people are worse. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little time they have left on Earth. Five words. Randomly selected for additional screening. Asians. They're light packers, treasure efficiency, and have a thing for slip-on shoes. God love'em. I'm like my mother. I stereotype. It's faster. Are you upset at your laptop? Fats Domino had a lighter touch. What are you working on so furiously? Who is it for? Natalie, what is it, you think we do here? That's what we're selling. But it's not what we're doing. Our job is to make limbo tolerable - To ferry wounded souls across the river of dread and humiliation to the point at which hope's bright shore is dimly visible... And then to stop the boat, shove'em in the water, and make them swim while we row back to the palace of their banishment to present the employers with our bills. I got to grab this. I'll meet you at the rental lot. Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you. I'm in Hotlanta. I need a rib joint recommend bad. Fat Matt's. Bring a bib. You haven't called. You know, I didn't know what was appropriate... Ryan, I'm not some waitress you banged in a snow storm. The word "Appropriate" has no place in our collective vocabulary. I'm the woman you don't have to worry about. This sounds like a trick. Next time you're worried about manners - Don't. If you want to call - Call. Just think of me as yourself... only with a vagina. When am I going to see you? I'm out of Hartsfield, into IAD, then a connection at ORD into SDF. Oh... sorry. Tell me about it. How long is your layover in O'Hare? They've got multiples into SDF... Think you could push? I can push. (to desk girl) Ryan Bingham, from CTC. All you have to do today is watch and listen. When I talk about the strategy packet. You hand them one of these... Everything important in life comes with a packet. Thank you for coming by. As you're probably well aware, this is a tough economic climate and your company is not immune. While I wish I was here with better news, the reason you and I are meeting is this is your final week of employment here. This is not a time to look for blame. Your position simply no longer exists. I understand why you are saying these things. 42. It's perfectly natural to feel this way. I want you to take the next week to explore this strategy packet... Fill out the skill set work sheet... Use the hopes and dreams diagram... And the tree of aspirations. The answers are all in there. The answers are all in there. The answers... The answers... ... are-all-in-there. And what do you suggest I tell them? Positive effect? Go fuck yourself. That's what my kids'll think. Your children's admiration is important to you? Yeah. It was. Well, I doubt they ever admired you, Bob. Hey asshole, aren't you here to console me? I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake up call. You know why kids love athletes? Because they screw lingerie models. No, that's why we love athletes. Kids love them because they follow their dreams. Yeah, well I can't dunk. But you can cook. What are you talking about? Your resume says you minored in French Culinary Arts. Most students work the frier at KFC. You bussed tables at Il Picatorre to support yourself. Then you got out of college and started working here. (looks up at Bob) How much did they first pay you to give up on your dreams? Twenty seven thousand a year. At what point were you going to stop and go back to what made you happy? Do you believe in fate, Bob? Fate? Yeah. You know, the mysterious ways in which we wind up doing the things we were meant to do. I met my wife at a gas station. Exactly. Well, I think fate is telling you to do something, Bob. I see guys who work for the same company their entire lives. Clock in. Clock out. Never a moment of happiness. (pauses for effect) Not everyone gets this kind of opportunity. 45. The chance for rebirth. If not for yourself... Do it for your kids. We reserve priority assistance for our Hilton Honors members. You should look into it - The promotions are great... You okay? Our expense account allots for forty dollars each on dinner. I plan on grabbing every mile I can. Your really want to know? I don't spend a nickel, if I can help it, unless it somehow profits my mileage account. I'm not talking hotel rooms and rental cars either, but internet services, cell phone, music downloads, teleflorists. The works. I shop them according to the miles they pay and I pit them against each other for the most value. No, it's not like that... The miles are the goal. Let's just say I've got a number in mind and haven't hit it yet. I'd rather not. It's ten million miles. Pi is just a number. I'd be the seventh person to do it. More people have walked on the moon. Lifetime Exec Platinum status. You get to meet the Chief Pilot, Maynard Finch. And... They put your name on the side of a plane. Now, who's stereotyping? And why do you suppose that's singular to men? Thanks for the advice. Man alive. My sister is cooky. She thinks this is charming... Like the gnome thing. She should be so lucky to visit Lambert Field. The Wright Brothers flew through there... (points out the conical The domed main terminal was the first of its kind. A precursor to everything from JFK to DeGualle. Why she wants dozens of reminders of all the places she hasn't been is beyond me. Look - Before Lindbergh could cross the Atlantic, he took off from one of those runways... Ever wondered why they call it the Spirit of St. Louis? Sometimes, they just need to vent. People say these things all the time. It comes with the trade. Sure. People are always saying crazy stuff. They get worked up. (not quite sure) I think that's a good sign. No... it's just talk. I mean, no, nothing good can come of that, but I don't think you should worry about it. This is the job. Taking people at their most fragile moment and setting them adrift. Okay. This is where it gets a little difficult, but stay with me. You have a new backpack... but this time, I want you to fill it with people. Start with casual acquaintances, people around the office, friends of friends and work your way to the people you trust with your most intimate secrets. Now move into family members - cousins, aunts, and uncles. Get your sisters and your brothers and you parents. Get them all in that backpack. And finally your husband or wife or boyfriend or girlfriend. Get them in their too. Don't worry. I'm not going to ask you to light it on fire. Feel the weight of that bag. Make no mistake, your relationships are the heaviest components of your life. Feel the straps cutting into your shoulders. All those negotiations and arguments and secrets and compromises. Now set that bag down. You don't need to carry all that weight. Some animals were meant to carry each other. To live symbiotically over a lifetime. Star-crossed lovers. Monogamous swans. We are not one of those animals. The slower we move, the faster we die. We are not swans. We're sharks. Is that so bizarre? I don't see the value. Sell it to me. Sell me marriage. Pff... How many stabile marriages do you know? I'm surrounded by people to talk to. I doubt that will change. Starting when I was twelve, we moved each one of my grandparents into a nursing facility. My parents went the same way. Make no mistake. We all die alone. Those cult members down in San Diego with the white sneakers and little Dixie cups of Kool-Aid. They didn't die alone. Just saying - There's options. Oh fuck. Oh, hey... I... Hi. Alex this is Natalie. Natalie, this is my... friend, Alex. I should give you both a moment. Maybe a drink? He broke up with you over text message? That's kind of like firing people over the internet. (re: the ex-boyfriend) What a weasely prick. We all fall for them. Pricks are spontaneous, unpredictable, and fun. And then we're surprised when they turn out to be pricks. You did? To Nebraska. You'll do plenty. Life can underwhelm you that way. It doesn't work that way. At a certain point, you stop with the deadlines. They can be a little counterproductive. (my generation?) It was our pleasure. Well done. You really thought this guy was the one. The bill? I'm not sure if... Right. Huh, let me think for a sec. (mulls it over) Well, by the time you're thirty four, all the physical requirements are pretty much out the window. I mean you secretly prey he'll be taller than you. Not an asshole would be nice? Just someone who enjoys my company. Comes from a good family - You don't think about that when you're younger. Wants kids... Likes kids... 62. Wants kids. Healthy enough to play catch with his future son one day. Please let him earn more than I do. That doesn't make sense now, but believe me, it will one day. Otherwise it's just a recipe for disaster. Hopefully some hair on his head...? But it's not exactly a deal-breaker anymore. Nice smile... Yep, a nice smile just might do it. Tried it. We're no picnic ourselves. You're young. Right now you see settling as some sort of failure. Don't worry, by the time someone is right for you, it won't feel like settling... And the only person left to judge you will be the twenty four year old girl with a target on your back. No... It's nothing like that. ... We were going to hit that party for the tech conference in the hotel. Well, I mean... Jennifer Chu? It's going to be fine. You okay there? Thank you, Natalie. How's everyone doing out there?! I'm going to need you to all put your hands together for a very special guest - YOUNG... M... C! THIS HERE'S A TALE FOR ALL THE Think she'll be okay? Look... Back home, I don't get to act the way I do with you. That's why I don't have a "back home". I know. You're so cool. "Mr. Empty Back Pack". You know about the back pack? I googled you. You did? (smiles, continues story) Right? (relives it for a second) So just as we're hovering over the hospital, I sit up. And from there, I could see the whole western horizon. We'd been flying twenty minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a city I'd thought of as remote, halfway across the state... a foreign capital. My parents had taught me we lived in the best place on Earth, but now I could see the world was really just one place and comparing didn't make much sense. And I remember thinking - Don't tell me this isn't an age of miracles. Don't tell me we can't be everywhere at once. I don't know what originally sparked the back pack. I probably needed to be alone. Recently, I've been thinking that maybe I needed to empty the bag before I knew what to put back in. Hey... I think we're out of gas. Hey, you're up... Got to fly stand-by and make a meeting in Milwaukee. Oh... Okay. (notices, teasing) Oh, no. I made you feel cheap. Yeah, all right... Just leave the money on the dresser. I'll text you later so we can swap schedules. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed spending time with someone as much as you. Neither can I. Just relax. It was nice to see you cut loose. So, did you wake him up or slip out? This morning... Your new friend. Did you wake him for an awkward good bye or just slip out so he could feel like a whore. Protocol is always tricky. Sometimes there really is no right thing to do. (a good lie) It's simple, you know that moment when you look into someone's eyes and you feel them looking right into your soul, and the whole world goes quiet for a second. Right. Well, I don't. Oh come on, I'm just dicking around. I need your help... A chance to what? Natalie, your definition of "real" is going to evolve as you get older... Bullshit philosophy? No, it's simply a life choice. Wow. Big words. Well, screw you too. I don't have a gauntlet of... ... Fuck! These Detroit guys can be tough. They've been getting hammered. Don't get distracted. Stick to the simple stuff. Get the packet in their hands and get them out the door. Welcome to Detroit. What's going on here? I've been getting those great numbers over the last few days. Thought we should nut up and give this a try. We could use a little more time. Gotta leave the nest at some point. This is a real company, Craig. We're here to do some damage. I know. Good thing we brought our best. So let's stop screwing around, alright? Just give me a minute to prepare and get my things together. I was thinking Natalie takes this one. She's hardly ready for this. I've been watching her. She's great. (re: the webcam) This is a whole other animal... I mean, she created it. Natalie, you not up for it? Atta girl. Just remember, don't apologize. Don't tell them how hard this is for you. Today is one of the worst days they will ever have. What we feel doesn't even compare. Just keep it professional. You're going to do fine. (checking out the PC) What's going on here? What are you talking about? What, just like that? I can't believe... Who are you? I work here for seventeen years and they send some fourth grader in here to can me? What the fuck is this?! Greater opportunities? I'm fifty- seven-fucking years old! You did good. You okay? Want me to take over. ... We just got out here. That was one place. I think we need to try a few more... Maybe there isn't a difference, but it's comforting to know we're in the next room. I know you don't give a shit about my comfort. We could just use a little more time. That's all I'm saying. Right... Right. (shakes his head) Yeah... Alright... Uh huh. Bye. He thought you did a great job. You did - I was real proud of you. We're being pulled off the road. We're going home. That's what it looks like. It's alright. I understand. It's fine. What do you mean? Oh, I don't know. Grabbing another flight... Something I need to take care of. I'll see you in, uh... at home. I have to admit, when you asked me to meet you in Vegas... I thought we'd gamble, make out in a heart shaped jacuzzi, maybe see one of those weird French Canadian circus shows. There'll be plenty of time for all that. (directing the photo) One more foot to the left. How do you feel about the wedding? I'm fine, I guess. (directing the photo) Okay great... walk away. They're a cute couple. Think so? Yeah, they'll make cute kids. If they're lucky, maybe look a little like you. How do you like Wisconsin in February? Who doesn't? 81. I like it if you're there. Besides, I know a killer burger in Milwaukee. Northern Wisconsin. What are you doing this weekend? No... What? I haven't even... I can't. Why not? I couldn't. I'm being serious. You want me to be your date? Well... Yeah. To a wedding... Jesus, Ryan. Your sister's wedding? It's not like I know her that well. I'm just not sure if it's appropriate for me to... Look. You know. I'm not the wedding type. But for the first time in my life... I don't want to be that guy, alone with his drink. I want a dancing partner. I want a plus one. And if you can stomach it, I'd like it to be you. Okay. Really? Yeah, I can't believe I... Yeah, I'm in. When is it? I feel like we should kiss or something. Then kiss me. (to the CHECK-IN LADY) Are you available? Sorry, this line is for members of our Matterhorn program. Kara... Alex, this is my sister Kara. Hi. Kara, what are you doing at a hotel? You're not staying at the house? Oh, okay. Um... It's not exactly... So, the rehearsal dinner? There's a packet. What in life is worth doing that doesn't have a packet. Um, I love you? The basket was very lovely. Me? You're the one getting married. I brought those photos you were asking for... There were quite a few already up there. Almost couldn't find room. What gave you the idea to do something so... ... Substantial? It was a great idea. It's sixty acres up against the foothills. I subdivided the old Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice for myself. Sounds nice. Homes will go in the high fours. Must be a nice development. It's a community, not a development. The concept is turn-key everything. You buy a maintenance contract with the home. We'll whack your weeds, we'll even change the light bulb. Furniture? You buy your own or choose a package. Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks. Nice. We all need a place to call our own. This is America. This is what we were promised. That's a nice touch. What? That bit at the end about promise... I like it. (a little embarrassed) Thanks. So, you still renting that one- bedroom? I gave it up. You own now? No. But you're looking? Not really. No. I don't think that's for sleeping. One more box... I'll get it. You sure? Yeah, yeah... Jim seems like a good guy. Hey, Julie, I was thinking... with dad not being... Well, I didn't know if you had someone to walk you down the aisle... Oh... Oh, great. Just wanted to make sure you were covered. So I should get there at... Hey Kara? Can you believe she's getting married already? She's just a kid. Oh. That's all you got? Are we really doing this? Give me a boost. I took geography in here. That was my seat. You ever fool around with one of your teachers? No. You? Not until college. Come on, show me around. You played basketball? Point guard. Don't act so surprised. I didn't know you were such a jock. My first fight. How'd it go? Got my ass kicked. This is where we used to go to make out. Very romantic. I'm really happy I came here. (to the team) Go Cougars! (checks caller ID) It's Kara. What's wrong? What happened? Yeah, of course... I'll grab your suit. Good luck. What happened? Today? What do you want me to do? You want me to talk to him? I haven't been to bat. I haven't been in the dugout. I tell people how to avoid commitment. It's a philosophy. Hey, it might have helped you. Ryan? Oh, hey Jim. You ever read this? Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff. I'll say. Kara mentioned you were having some... thoughts? I don't think I can do this. Okay. What makes you say that today? I was just laying there last night in bed and I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about the wedding and the ceremony and all. Us buying a house and moving in together. Having a kid... Having another kid... (begins to snowball) ... Thanksgiving, Christmas, spring break, football games, all of a sudden they're out of school, getting jobs, getting married, And then, you know... I'm a grandparent. I'm retired. Before you know it - I'm dead... and I just kept thinking... "What's the point?" (now asking Ryan directly) I mean what is the point? The point? Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here? It's marriage... it's the most beautiful thing on Earth... you know, what everyone aspires to... You never got married. That's true... You never even tried. Well, it's hard to define "try". You seem happier than most of my married friends. Jim, I'm not going to lie. Marriage can be a pain in the ass. And you're kind of right - All of this is just stuff on the way to your eventual demise. We are all on running clocks that cannot be slowed down or paused and they all lead to the same place. Some guys leave marks that last beyond their own mortality. Not guys like you and me... But some. But even those footprints disappear. There isn't a "point". I'm not the guy you'd normally want to talk to about all this stuff... But think about it - your favorite memories. The greatest moments of your life? Were you alone? (thinks about it) No... I guess not. I don't want to sound like a Hallmark card, but... Life? It's better with company. Come to think of it... Last night, the night before your wedding, when all this shit was circling through your head... Weren't you two sleeping in separate rooms? Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment and I was all alone in that big honeymoon suite... Kind of lonely? Yeah. Hey. Everybody needs a copilot. That's a nice touch. Thanks. What's the mood like out there? It's not good... Emotional. What should I do? (twinkle in his eye) Go get her. I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up... Will you be my co-pilot? Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm your cousin... Harold. Oh, hey! When am I going to see you? You're just going to have to come and visit. So settled down. You're not going to change on me... Same guy. Just one address. Call me if you get lonely. ... I'm lonely. You don't actually call them that. Really? I can't imagine why. Are they actually on line, right now? This is ridiculous. You ready to rock? Last year, I flew three hundred fifty thousand miles. The moon is only two fifty. Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... You feel them? Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things. The... um... The stuff in drawers and on shelves. Excuse me. What the fuck are you doing? Okay, everyone just relax. We'll have your next guest out in a sec. Surprise. What are you doing here? Who was that? ... just some guy who was lost. How could you lie to me? What were you thinking - Just showing up at my door like that? What do you mean? I wanted to see you. I didn't know you had a family - Why didn't you tell me that? Come on, I thought we signed up for the same thing. Try to help me understand. What is it you signed up for? I thought our relationship was perfectly clear. You're... 105. (a long beat) ... an escape. I'm an escape? You know, a break from our normal lives... A parenthesis. I'm a parenthesis? Seriously, Ryan? I can't believe we're having this conversation. I mean what do you want? You don't even know what you want. I'm sorry that I ruined your night... But you could have seriously screwed things up for me. That was my family. That's my real life. I thought I was a part of your real life. Look, Ryan. I'm a grown up. I don't hold a grudge. When you're ready to be an adult and see me again, just give me a call. Yeah, right, you got me in 2C? What's got you so fucking happy? Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special announcement to make. Our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of Mesa... which might not mean much to most of you, but means a lot to one of our fliers today, because he just hit Oh no... That seat taken? You're the youngest yet to hit twenty mil. Don't know where you found the time... Oh right, here you go. You know how many times I've thought about this moment? Played out the conversation I'd have with you right here. Really? What did you want to say? You know, I... I can't remember. That's alright. Happens to all of us. (attempts chit chat) So, where you from? I'm from here. Hello, Mr. Bingham. Oh, how did you know it was me? This is your dedicated line. We reserve them for our most loyal and dedicated fliers. Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my miles. Can you open up an account under Jim and Julie Miller? Certainly. How many miles would you like to transfer? How many miles would it take to circle the globe? We have our "around-the-world" tickets. They're five hundred thousand miles each. Sounds perfect. Got a second? (to the airline operator) I'm going to have to call you right back. What happened to you yesterday? I was trying to reach you all day. I got tied up in... personal stuff. What's going on? Do you remember Karen Barnes? No, I fire dozens of people a day. She killed herself. Jumped off a bridge. Fuck. Yeah. Do you remember anyone giving you any signals of anything? Depression? They're all depressed. We're firing them. Hey, look, you know I have to ask. No, I don't remember anything. Of course they're upset. You never think that... Wasn't any woman who gave you any indication...? Anything? No, nothing that stands out. Is Natalie alright? Is she coming in? Natalie quit. Just like that? Text message. She say where she was going? Nah. She was pretty upset. I should give her a call. I need you back in the air. I'm fine. What about video conferencing? CTC is pausing on the whole new media front for a moment. Giving it a little more thought. Getting our work horses back out doing what they do best. How long are you sending me out? We're going to let you sail and sail. Send us a postcard if you ever get there. So, what happened? You graduated top of your class. You seemed to have your pick of employment... Including right here. Instead, you went to Omaha... to fire people for a living. I can't imagine doing that day-in- day-out. Not in this climate. Everybody does at one point or another. This guy says I'd be lucky to have you. Hope he's right.
