This is it. Why did it have to be these caves... Is something wrong? Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'. Let's get that first barrel. What's with the awkward silence? You don't know? Last winter, a man kidnapped a little  girl and holed up in one of these  caves. The cops had him pinned down  and began to move in. This guy started  shooting... but he wasn't aiming at  the officers... ...he was firing at something inside. When the dust cleared, all they found  was the little girl's shoes. With the feet still in 'em. Ahh!!! Assholes. Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself  when my boss pulled that one on me. I went well beyond nearly. What was that? Once was plenty, fellas. Shhhh... Stop it right there! You will not  rape Mother Nature one more day! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Mother Nature is not a whore/Don't  dump in her any-more/Mother Nature  is not a whore/Don't dump in her any- more... Take it easy! We have a permit! And we have an injunction from the  State to prevent any dumping in these  caverns! This is virgin land! The  aqueducts in these caves bring  drinking water to our families, and  its piping provides drainage for our  farms that enrich this barren land!  And it won't be tainted by waste of  any kind! Not now! Not ever! Fine, just back off! Let's roll... Now-now-now! How do you guys always know where  we're going? I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT! Score one for the green team!!! Hey, man, that was righteous, but I  need a shot with the sign up. We saved you today, ol' gal. Oh, fuck! Sister, why do you always swing for  the fences? It's okay, but I... I think I see  something in there... something shiny. Oh my, it looks like diamonds! Give me the keys!!! They took my laptop with my PowerPoint  presentation, my Blackberry, my  cell... And to top it off, my car  crapped out on the side of the road!  I'm not making the conference and I  have fourteen leads waiting for me.  You gotta help me out here. I'm not  kidding, I've have fourteen PRIMO  leads waiting in the lobby of the  Mariott... MARIOTT... Son of a -- In with anger, out with love. Hey... Shut up, fag. You're late! Don't dilly-dally then. Rack 'em! I mean, we'd been together for so  long and then... bang! She drops me.  Since then, it's been like a damn  country song: she's gone, the car's  repossessed, and a father figure  made a pass at me. I'm not saying I  ever had it. But I have definitely  lost it. Now I haul this swill from armpit to  armpit. I used to be a model for  Christ's sake. For what, may I ask? JC Penny. Spring wear. You know, Chach, catching you at  this low point is pure serendipity. Why is that? Because I take the rubble of man and  build superstars. In my briefcase  here is a doorway to a self-help  sensation. Give me a minute, because  I'd like to buy you a drink and change  your life forever. I have a brochure -- Save it. We don't deal in pamphlets  'round here. We stick to chemistry.  And his drinks are on me. Was that the last keg? Yup, one keg of Beast for the  basement, then the truck's dry. If you're stayin', move the truck,  boss gets pissed about you using  primo parking. Right, 'cause this joint's hopping. Listen, bud. I got a load ready to  move and your man's not here. He's coming. Relax. And if he doesn't  show -- We got a problem. That cash is gonna look much better  in my pocket. Ya know, that deer only looks scared  when you're in the room. Excuse me, please. Jesus! That's all she wrote... What?! Ohhh, now that's a rough one. That's motherfuckin' impossible! Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go  again? Goddamn it! NO! Oh, come on. Crape Diem! Wake up! Check your pants! Get outta here. What's that? Wha'cha say? Huh? How much for the whole night, Grandma? This one will stun ya, but this one  will put ya to sleep. Whoa! You boys wanna try your luck at the  loot? Come on, I'll even throw with my  left hand. Nothin' but a bunch of butts and  pussies in here! Don't sweat it, just clean it up  before he's done. Mommy, I want Nemo. I love a woman with enthusiasm. I got two hundred bucks says none of  you can beat me! Hey! Get quiet or get out. C'mon guys -- Gimme some ACTION -- Unless you people want to die you'll  do what I say and you'll do it fast! You hold it right there, mister. A storm of hell's coming down on  this place any minute! Drop the canon! I'm not armed now, just hear me out. I'll drop you and not even think  about it! Let me explain! You got one second to -- Take a good look and listen to me!  There's at least a four of these  things out there! I saw one of them tear up five men  like they were corn on the cob! I don't know what they are. I don't  know where they came from. All I do  know is that these fuckers are fast,  nasty, and hungry. And they can fly. Not to mention  they got claws like Ginsu knifes and  more teeth than a chainsaw. They're like goddamn blood hungry  biker tattoos come to life. They're  clocking us. Right now. And we have  to lock this bar down! That means doors, windows, drains,  and basements. We have to do it fast! You! Get on that phone. Call the  cops, National Guard, townies, whoever  kicks ass and get 'em out here. Any questions? Who are you? I'm the hero -- I got you! Got 'cha! You'll hit her! What the FUCK was that? Is it clear?! Yeah. Is there a gun pointing at you? Nah, I got the gun. Alright goddamn it! Who shot me!?  Who did it!? My goddamn foot is gone! Who fuckin'  shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!? Her fella. Well, where's the sonuvabitch!? What? What the hell happened down here?! I didn't do it! It was fuckin'  monsters, asshole! Jesus Christ on the cross... someone  make sense. So, your dead hubby shot me twice,  three of my customers have been eaten,  and there are angry creatures outside? Huh? It was an accident. Sorry. Fan-fuckin-tastic. Please elaborate. And the rest of 'em? And the last one is the -- Of all the friggin' bars to be stuck  in. Hey! Mommy -- Oh god... Are you -- The back phone is wrecked, too. What'd you say? Thank you, but I don't need any help -- No. It's nothing. Hey, it pays more than the couch. So, what now? Did those things leave? Why don't you go check it out? Fuck no. Anything? Yeah, you got it. That's right, the crowds are lining  up early to witness tomorrow's  meteorological phenomenon. But always remember, don't look  straight into the sun because a  special filter is needed to avoid  damaging your cornea. And we're all looking forward to it  tomorrow. Back to you. That studio's local, we can call in. I have a short wave radio upstairs. They'd have a police scanner. An associate of mine was coming in  from the north, ain't heard a word  from him in hours. This is goddamn depressing. I've got some tools and extra planks  in the kitchen, if we're on the same  page here. We'll it ain't pretty... But its got teeth. I think it's hungry again. Fire in the hole! I think we got -- Looks like they're soft on the inside  like any other animal. Trick is to  get in there and do the damage. Right, let's just call 'em names. Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have  your attention. We have to think outside the box  here. We don't need to fight them,  we need to scare them. Scare them  right back. This is a species stand- off. We just need to show them we're  not vulnerable. That we're formidable. I need a stick. Stand back. Let's get that board down. Showing superiority. The scent of  their dead may drive them away. I don't see them. Come on. Come onnnnnn. See that you monkey fucks! That's  what you get when you mess with us!  Woman or man, I don't give a fuck!  Shit don't make me gay because you'll  be sucking my dick! Sweet... It's working. I think it's working. You see? What I tell you? Oh dear... What are they doing now? Dude, they're humpin'! Any more ideas, Animal Planet? I-I-I was just being proactive... Hey, you weren't helpin'! Go douche. What the hell now? Hey, Miss? If you don't mind me asking, how did  you run into these things? More importantly, how did you run  away from these things? Holy mother of... What's goin' on? The pumps are off. There's nobody here -- Turn on the pump! Suck it down you metal bitch. Suck  it down. Move it! Get in the car, baby. Roll! Shit! We made it! Break! Go! Go! Go! Look out! And the head? So, your husband ditched you? Well, justice is funny. The three from the gas pump are over  at the TV station? And you say there's  four here, huh? There's five here now, actually. Yeah, thanks for that. Hey, you lived on a farm, right? We? We learned fast? You are all  that is left of we. No offense  Pocohantas, but I think someone else  should play "Chief" tonight. Someone  that knows the lay of the land. Like me. You! Wha? You gotta know somethin', you're  old. I don't know a thing. Old people know stuff like this.  Legends, tall tales, shit like that. No! Spill it! I don't know anything! How 'bout you? Or do I have to get  rough? Come on! Think back! If I throw a stick, will you go away? That's just horse shit. Yeah... allegedly. Hey, where was your farm? Did you ever slaughter? Slaughter  livestock? What are you talking about? Slaughterhouse run-off used to be  drained into piping that ran through  the mountains. Earthquakes often cracked the piping  and those flow lines were condemned,  but never drained. Cheese n' rice... What I am saying is... there's a  distinct possibility that what we  are up against is the result of steady  stream of blood and tissue that has  been leaking into the caves. And a  day ago... something broke out. The first order of business is gettin'  a big fuckin' tampon in that cave! Nope, that wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do that. They're probably on to the next buffet  by now. There's a retirement home up  the road, they'd be easy pickings. ...Duh. In the kitchen, under the sink. Thanks. You're a clever man. Why do you take shit from him? Yeah, he's an ass, but he's my  brother. Que sera-sera. Your brother, huh? Yep. Same parents? Look man, I read books. He reads  bumper stickers. I got my .38 here. That's six shots  and two refills. Downstairs, I have  locker with a sawed-off and some  gardening tools. Maybe a few boxes  of shells. I got shells, too. Box and a half  tops. Machete behind the bar. So we've got guns, kitchen knives,  pipes, fire and sticks. I might be able to do something with  the bottles. You're gonna need a whole lot more  than that to get outta here alive. Oh, now you have something to say? You young'uns worry about weapons,  I'm thinkin' 'bout strategy. Oh? And what's that? Sit still, look less like a meal. That's for bears and sharks, chunky  chew. I have a CB in my truck, we could  get some help out here. Who the hell would you call? Anyone. Do you drive a short beer bus or  something? You go out there, you get  eaten. You stay in here, you get  eaten. Anyone comes to help, they  get eaten. Don't you see a pattern  here, Spuds Makenzie? Then I guess we should just give up. Believe me, I'd love to save the day  and get some heroic snatch, but it's  not in the cards, partner. Upstairs. Go for it. It's by the far wall.  Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. Let's not get carried away... So that's how it is? Fine! Shotgun, please. You're coming with, portly. 'Cause  if I'm attacked, I want a fat man  close by. I'll wait by the door. Now who else is comin'? I'll go with ya. What are you gonna do? Throw your  teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon. You! Zorba! You're coming too! Now gimme the keys. What? Don't get your hopes up. That's not a good idea. With what happened upstairs -- Count me in. Me too. Alright you two, I don't want to  hear any of this, "oh, I dropped the  key, wrong key, ain't no key here."  When I want out, I want out, ok? They're right here. We've got your back, bro. Just keep 'em handy, ladies. Wish me luck... I'm okay! I'm okay! Come on. Come on. Come on. Geeezzzus. Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths.  Easy steps. Well... Morphine. My magic potion. I need a  few drops. You should try a little, it'll calm  your nerves. Works like a charm. Wait, before you do that, help me  move. There's a small room off the  kitchen where I can lay down. It's much safer in there. Trust me. Stay on your toes everybody. You don't need to know what that is. There's a sawed-off shotgun in here. Come on, bro. Lamaze. Lamaze. Lamaze. HAAAA! Just a bat! I'm okay! Just a bat! If he doesn't shut up... He is human kabob. I can't feel a thing, Hon. You're a bad girl, aren't you. The girl's got rhythm. There it is. This is all junk. This could come in handy. Hello? Anyone there? We need help  out here at the United Nations Tavern.  Send guns, tanks, and all that shit. Hell yeah. How much I got, what? You don't understand, sweety. Daddy  doesn't pay. Daddy sees the show for  free. But you do get points for being  horny on a night like this. You can't expect a man to buy a car  without a test drive first, can you? Now wiggle that sweet little ass  over here and sit on Daddy's face, I  wanna do some appraising. Repeat. We need help. SOS. Calling  all cars! Calling all cars! We need  help at the United Nations Tav -- Shit! Double shit! Okay, I'm ready to come out now! Oh! "OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh"  mean? HEY! OPEN IT!!! Wha? OPEN THE DOOR!!! Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!! NO! NO! NO! Great god, why do you damn me?! GET ME OUTTA HERE!!! Oh please, no. They're getting in! Somebody help! HELP!!! GODDAMN IT!!! The key broke off! HELP ME PLEASE!!! HELLLLLP!!! HELLLLLLLLP!!! I thought that was it for a second  there. I got Papa in the stones. He's neutered. Whoa... good one... That back room is sealed shut. Yeah... I will. I will. Promise. If they can't reproduce anymore --  we are one step closer! A big step!  Now is the time to band together. We  need to rise up against these monsters  of the night! Those creatures are no  match for the human spirit! We can  do it! We just need to believe in  each other! In all of us! We need to  make a stand! Right here! Right now! Dude, are you gay? The lot's too damn far, that's  surefire suicide. What? I don't know shit. Wait, wait, wait. It's a tunnel. It runs about a hundred yards and  spits out on the backside of that  hill down the way. Grass, man. I grow pot down there. It spits out behind the parking lot. My truck is near, but it ain't nearly  big enough to haul the whole lot. Fully. Two. Six. Seven. Thirteen clowns wouldn't fit. What're you planning? Sounds sketchy. Give 'em to me, I'm going. You're trusting that con? He'll ditch  us and never look back. Fuck you too. Get in line! "Courage is being scared to death,  but saddling up anyway." The Duke. I will go. This is a bottleneck waiting to  happen. This one's great under pressure. I  wish you luck. No, I don't believe in guns. This ain't time for a political  stance. This doesn't run out of ammo. Got ya. Hey! When you get to that truck... drive  it like you stole it. Oh yeah? Ya know, that's not a bad look on  you. Kinda 1985, but not bad. I'd  hook it up. Tease. Hey, cyclops. Let's have a quiet  contest... starting now. Ya know, in situations of duress, I  have found that women are attracted  to my authority. You handle yourself pretty well. You  a cop or a criminal? Oh yeah? Then how do you do it? This place is creepy in the daytime,  too. Ready? Scared? No. You? Of course not. I fight monsters all  the time. On three. One... two... three!!! Well, look at that. Hey, little fella. Looks like a brothel for plants. Shhhhhhhhhhhhh. Ah-ah-ah! You're doing that all wrong! What do you know? I know you're doing it wrong. Prove it. Move aside, princess. You and I are similar. We both have  accents. We both travel a lot. We  both don't really have homes... You should be quiet. I am sorry, I ramble when I'm nervous. It's just that this seems like the  opportune time for someone to be  horribly... offed. What did I say? Sorry. I'm done now. You don't want the rag touching booze,  that way you can hold it and ensure  it explodes when you throw it. You sure? I thought the rag had to  touch? I'm sure. Perfecto. What we should do, though,  is put those peanut barrels to use.  Fill 'em with booze and line up some  planks. If the walls come down... we  hit 'em Donkey Kong style. Genius. You aren't nearly as dumb as you  look, are you? Next time, look within. Stereotyping  can be ugly and hurtful. Excuse me for being forward, but I'm  curious about your dimensions. Hold up. You hear something? They're trying to burrow through the  tunnel walls. Like moles these things. Duck! Stay down! The shells are wet! Grab onto ceiling and get out of  water! What? Do it!!! Get out of water!!! They will write stories of your  bravery. If there's anybody left. Come on! Ol' Crazy Horse has seen it. Don't be stupid, drop the gun! Welcome back. What the hell happened? Ingenuity, baby. Ingenuity. I have two left. Make it count. Bullshit. If you ask me, I'm gonna just lay  right here, wait for sunrise, then  walk on out of here. If all of you run for it, they won't  care about lil ol' me. They like the  food that moves... OHHH!!! HELP ME!!! Bonsai! Hot potato!!! We're gonna die! What's that? RUN!!! That wall's coming down! Commence Plan B! Just watch the floor and keep the  others safe! Bomb's away!!! One down, one to go!!! I can't hold him!!! God... I need to get your number. No thank you, we're content. When this lights, run like hell. The fan has officially been buried  in the shit. Motherfucker! Give him back! Oh Jesus! HELLLPPP! I thought we lost you -- You FUCKER! DO IT! Get me FUCK BIRDS! No you don't! VENGEANCE! Oh Jesussss... We had a good run. HELP ME! HELP ME SOMEBODY! Hang on! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Oh shit! NOOO!!! COME ON! GODDAMN IT! Brother!!! I meant to tell you so much! Close your eyes, hon. YOU ARE SUCKING MY DICK!!! Motherfucker!!! Lord, if I die, bury me upside down  so the world can KISS MY ASS! I think we're in the clear -- Mommy! What's the damage radius? Twenty miles. Red Mountain,  surrounding farms, local TV studio. How many picked up the broadcast? We'll have figures within the hour. Sir, what's the spin? Tornado cluster. This is the California high desert. Get what you need to sell it. Sir, we have movement! Open it. Gentlemen, help them to safety. Relax. We know. We're the calvary. What happened to you? Get these cuffs off me! I'm a goddamn  hero for Christ's sake! Thanks for waitin' for me back there,  really fuckin' appreciate it! I found a new weak spot on 'em, but  it damn ain't pretty getting to it. A trauma center. We have doctors  waiting. You're in good hands now. Do it quick and spread the mess.
