A year younger than I was for my first.  When can I have a stag?   Oh come on!  Why would they join up against the Irish?  Because someone has to stand up to them.  You?  Me, Marke, all the tribes. We can’t  resist alone.  I could.  Oh my little warrior. We have to be  careful.  Come home without something for your  Lady there will be hell to pay.  Can I?  The Angles have arrives my Lord, as  well as the Carrods, our fellow Jutes  and the Saxons.  Good. With Marke, all will be here.   Let us hope so.  Thanks.  Mother, I made this for you  Friends, look at us.  The tribes of Britain. Divided. Weak.  Just as the Irish like us. But if we  were one land united, we would out number  them two to one. We could defeat them  once and for all. That is why we are  here today, to sign this treaty of unification.  But who would be King?  The strongest among us: Lord Marke.  Look if you are happy sending all of  your gold to Ireland, living as slaves  then by all means do nothing.  If we were happy doing that then we  would never have risked coming here.  Friends. My wife is with child, my heart  tells me it is a boy. I want him to  grow old in a land where all of us,  all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute,  Saxon are at peace. This island has  not known unity since the Romans left.  That is why I sign this treaty.   Perhaps, Wictred, because your last  attempt to form an alliance without  the knowledge of half the Barons in  this room has failed.  My Lord! The Irish are here!  Take all your men. Guard the women!  But you...   How did they know?   What news of the treaty?  Good Morholt, good  Your husband?  Oh sister I am so sorry.  A whole generation of men.  Tristan. Son of Aragon. We’re his family  now.  What shall we do, my Lord?  Rebuild.  Don’t hold back  Tristan won’t fight me! Look he’s scared!  Still won't fight?  Tristan has the heart of a lion.He just  needs some time.  Tristan!  Tristan! Tristan! We’ve found something!  Come on, this way.  I found a trapdoor!  Where does this lead?  Must be a burial crypt or something.  Who else knows about this?  Nobody.  Good.  The savages have rebuilt the castle  at Cornwall, only now it’s made of stone.  Of Cornwall’s next tribute I want slaves.  Young ones. Their future. If Marke resists  have Morholt crush him.  My King.  Morholt.  I have led your armies to victory far  and near. I’v made you rich and powerful.  Yes you have. You have been most loyal.  When I return from Cornwall, I was hoping...  What would please you?  A wife.  You have a duty to your King.  Then obey me, daughter.  Your father has given you the news?  And you welcome it?  You know, we are more alike than you  might guess.  I too dabble in elixirs.  Poison from  the livers of a puffer fish. Just a  taste paralyses all the senses. So if  the blade doesn’t kill...  And you know the antidote for this?  Makes a hard man even harder.  The only  cure... wild abandon. Till out wedding  day. I’m to Cornwall, to deal with rabbles.   Release them.  Leave her!  Take him there. Get a rope. Any man  foolish enough to interfere in any way  shall suffer the same fate.  If there are any more attacks we shall  put our guests to death and raise this  entire land. Take the horses.  When would you strike?  At once. Throw everything we have at  them.  They are hoping you'll do that. On horse  they outnumber us two to one. You would  lead the men straight to their deaths.  So we do nothing?!  Donnchadh would like that even more.  Me to lose face in front of the other  tribes. No, we must act. We must be  decisive but we cannot act alone.  So. Have the good men of York come to  fight with us? Hm? The Saxons of Wessex?  Then why are you here?  I make it my habit to follow no one.  Marke delivered me from that place when  I was a boy. You ran. So you can understand  that when I think of Kings I think of  him. When I think of cowards...  They are one day from their boats on  the old Roman road. Now who will ride  out with Tristan to fight them?  What is your plan, Tristan?  We will need our two fastest runners.  Go around!  Morholt, they’re back!  Kill the slaves!  Simon!  I don’t want to die.  Tristan!  I can’t feel my legs or my hands.   Build a second boat.  Tristan!  Tristan?  Did I love him like a son or did I misuse  him for my own purposes?  You said no one else knew.  Why are you doing this?  You’ve been away.  Where?  Seeking sanctuary?  You’ll find no refuge in a new religion.  Your place is here, with Morholt.  Overdue. But comforted no doubt that  you yearn for him.  What's your name?  How can I thank you if I don't have  your name?  Tristan of Aragon.  She likes me. She’s right though, you  do risk.  They also died when I was a child.  A different type of Irish kindness.  Tomorrow.  Ridiculous.  Than what?  Why would you need it?  You’re promised?  What’s he like?  I thought... earlier when you spoke  of wanting something you can’t have.  How do you feel?  Come with me. Come with me!  Why not? Please!  A Cornish warrior may be ashore. Beware.  We seek him as I speak. Hopefully it  is just his rotted corpse we'll find,  for he has slain your betrothed. Morholt  is dead. Fallen in battle. Isolde? Bragnae,  comfort her.  She’s stunned.  As am I by her grief.  We should assulat the British straight  away. Crush them with maximum force.  Maximum force. Like that of Marke’s  tribe with the maximum force you speak  of? I will not confront them again until  our numbers are refreshed. Until then,  we’ll have cunning divide them.  Of what nature?  A prize, perhaps.  Donnchadh. He has offered his daughter  and the lands of Lyonesse as dowry to  whichever English tribe wins. It is  a clever way of setting us against each  other.  For yourself you mean.  And ours as well.  So be it.  Ah, Melot, Melot, Melot. You are my  blood and you are a noble presence but......  Lord Marke! He’s back! It’s Tristan!  It cannot be!  I am delivered.   A toast! Tristan! Back from the dead.  Tristan. The Irish King offers his daughter  in tournament to divide the tribes.  For the power and the wealth half the  tribes have sent champions to fight  at the...  Tristan!  God knows what happened to him.       What?  It is the only way to keep the alliance  alive.  I fail to see how fighting with our  partners keeps us allies.  Well they are all going to the tournament  anyway. By announcing you will share  the dowry with every Baron that remains  loyal and in turn offering to support  whomever prevails, the others would  be compelled to follow you when you  win.  If we win. If we lose we could end up  following Wictred. I’d need an infallible  champion!  Me.  You are not yet healed.  Then this trip will be my tonic. I will  be ready. I know I will.  What is the source of this fervour?  Let me go and win you a wife. She can  make peace without spilling one drop  of blood, and maybe heal a wound from  which you still lack.  Truce. You have safe passage.  How do I look?  How do you look?  See how the bees come to the honey.  Tristan of Aragon.  So he lives.  For the moment.  Why Wictred?  Because the Barons will never unite  behind him.  Since the dawn of time...  ... Begin!  Make it for real!  I yield!  You were great!  Allow it!  Wictred: Lord of Saxonberg. Tristan:  Champion of Cornwall. Warriors: Begin!  Yield!  An impressive victory. Of course the  man who defeats Morholt might be expected  to triumph here.  On behalf of Cornwall, I offer your  daughter a place on our throne. The  throne of England, united behind one  leader.  Isolde! Perhaps it is just that he who  took a husband provides one.  No. Tristan of Aragon has won you on  behalf of Lord Marke of Cornwall.  Let them take her across the sea. After  the wedding I'll disavow Isolde, the  alliance will crumble.  Tristan. Princess wants to speak to  you.  You said your name was Bragnae. Why  did you do that?  I can't. I won you in my King's name.  It doesn't matter.  Your marriage will end a hundred years  of bloodshed.  Isolde. You will live with this. We  must.  What if she’s a hag? Or maybe she won’t  have me!  Isolde? Welcome.  That place does not exist.  You’re trembling. You are far from home  and I am a stranger still. But you mustn’t  fear me. My wish is to make you happy,  as a wife.. as a women and hopefully  one day, the fact that I am not whole  will not offend you.  That’s pretty. Did you make it?  Tristan?  Might I stay here a while?  Of course.  I’ve never seen him like this before.  I can tell. Laughing at the market,  holding hands, a caress on the neck  when he pours you wine.  Yes well, I must confess I thought you  might find more difficulties in performing  your duty.  I live in torture thinking of these  moments. With every look he gives you  I get sicker and sicker. There is a  burning in me, I feel on fire and guilt  and I can't get rid of either. Does  it make you happy to know that?  Welcome bands of Anglia, Rothgar and  Orick. Wessex: Kaye and Wictred.  It does. On the next full moon, all  will attend.  Bearing that in mind, and given the  instabilities of our new land I shall  be naming a second. My sister has raised  one, capable of guiding you if the need  should arise. He is a man of passion,  fierce in battle who has learnt to tame  his heart with his head. I give you  Tristan of Aragon.  For the first time since the Romans,  this country stands united.  I can’t be your second. Melot must be.  He is blood. Besides, I wish to journey  north.  You no longer sleep at Dor, and now  you don’t want to be my second. Do you  find no comfort in your home? These  stone walls that you helped build?  I find these walls a prison.  Why?  Everything I want seems misplaced.  Ever since you were a boy you sacrificed  everything for me. All for one dream.  is natural that you would feel some  loss. It doesn’t matter if you want  to be second. You are. I will only be  king if you are my second. I’d put it  more gently if I could.  Then I am your second.  Perhaps it is time that you took a wife!  No!  Can’t live alone forever.  I can!  Isolde. I was trying to explain to Tristan  the importance of loving. It seems he  might live without it.  There are other things to live for.  Duty. Honour.  Then I will no longer live without it.  Good. Very good! Come, we will be late!  The warriors ride out on the full moon.  It is an old ritual. I shall miss you  tonight.   None.  None.  Lord Marke! Are you hurt?  Nothing but for my pride.  Go ahead.  I tried to convince him you would be  better.  I am sorry he didn’t choose you. I am.  They were lives... just lived.  Would it be his or mine?  Where is Isolde?  There is another door here, forgotten.  This comes up in the bottom chamber  of the keep.  Hurry! Go on.  I didn’t ask you were you were. Your  heart is beating so fast.  Isolde. Is there anything I can do to  make you happier. I want to make you  happy.  How?  And your price?  When his throne falls apart, we’ll go  over and pick up the pieces.  Tristan? Can I speak with you? Is it  possible... do you think a man blinded  by love... Is it possible that that  man might not see treachery right in  front of him?  No.  Perhaps you could follow her. I can’t  ask anyone else. I know. I know what  you think – I’m acting like a child.  Normally I can read faces, but with  hers I feel like... I can't be objective.  She’s so delicate.  You really love her.  Oh... I do...terribly. I didn’t know  how empty I was. She sustains me, she  thrills me. And when I see this ring,  it is a ring of thorns.  The ring is nothing. She's loyal to  you. I am sure of it.  ... If you say so.  I count nine   If they move they will warn us with  a black flag  You bring an entourage?  I can let myself be alone in my position  Lord Marke. But don’t worry, they will  stay offshore.  I miss you.  My nephew, Merlot of Cornwall  And Tristan, slayer of my best general,  winner of Isolde, defender of the alliance.  You are a fortunate man.  Indeed.  Tristan! Seems I worried for nothing.  That’s right, you have never danced  with Isolde before!  You know.  I could still teach you a thing or two,  dancing being one of them.  Is something the matter?  Of course.  No. Tonight it cause for exception.  We honour it. In half a night. Ride  out! Where’s Tristan?  Isolde, this must end.  It cannot be.  Isolde? There is someone...  No.  I see how it is in Cornwall. My money  is good enough, my alliance is good  enough, but my daughter you pass amoung  your lieutenants like a whore!  I see no relation to me here! I will  see this peace end.  Seize him. Seize him.  They’re ashore.   If a man can’t rule his woman, how can  he govern an entire Kingdom?  We have suffered peace.  It’s all been coming apart. I can feel  it  You’re right.  What’s this?  And who might that be, Wictred?  I came to apologise. I’ve been selfish  arrogantly thinking that perhaps I’d  given enough. At least enough to merit  if not your love then at least your  respect. You have a home. A kingdom.  Why was it not enough? Tell me.  Tell  me! You do not know what you have done!  Everything is destroyed, everything!  All because you did not have enough.  She’s loyal to you I am sure of it.  You bloodsucker. What could it had been  had I not stretched out my hand to save  your life. How I curse that day, how  I curse it. And so be with your defence.  Donnchadh marches on us as we speak.  How long?  Tristan and Isolde?  The tunnel.  The Roman Tunnel!  What is this?  The will of the King. Farwell.  Get in.  For all time, they will say it was our  love that brought down a kingdom. Remember  us.  Get the livestock and fuel undercover.  Put some archers on the ramparts.  All the archers have deserted us as  has half the household.  And you stay?  If you are surprised then they have  won already.  Come on, hurry!  Burn it. Their will is as strong as  milk. The seas will unravel us. Where  is Wictred with his key?  Aim for the front of the line  They are waiting.  The Irish are inside!  Follow me!  What happened here?  Melot, I came to aid Marke.  I didn’t lead them here.  Why?  It will be undone.  As we were brothers.  They’re here!  Wictred.  He’s trying to lower the bridge  Traitor!  Give me your shield, we’re pinned down!  Tristan!  Him too?  No, he’s with us!  Tristan!  Tristan! How did you get here?  Secret. Secrets, in the bowls of the  keep.  In the bowls of the keep.  They have reached the palisades.  Then we must keep hope.        Get back! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!  Behold! The head of a traitor!  Will you always be little men, who cannot  see what was and could be again? There  is no middle ground! So slay us  or  slay him!  Oblidge them.  Oblidge them!  Take me out of here. Take me to the  river.  Hurry!  Bring her.  Marke, you must come, the battle needs  you. We’ll lose everything.  I must heed their call, I am the King.  We’ve driven them back as far as we  can but they are holding us at the throat.  Goodbye my friend.  You were right. I do not know if life  is greater than death, but love was  more than either.
