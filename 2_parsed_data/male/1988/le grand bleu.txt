He seems to have won it. The Italian, I presume? You're right. You're fired. Yes. Of course. Very wise. Good afternoon. I thought it was Spanish that you spoke? I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to... It can't be true! No! What's happened?? What d'you mean? My God! I'm glad I didn't go. Did the driver really freeze? I said that the file is incomplete. Johana, am I boring you? This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete. Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.The fool was asleep! If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with? That idiot! Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. And he's only waiting for one thing: that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there? Don't. You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right? You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant? No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana. I dive in search of God. If I go deep enough I'm going to find him. Because you'd laugh. You risk your life when you cross the street. What else is there? Checking out the competition. Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk. Jacques! Johana! No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare". You see I was right in getting you out here. You're a world champion, my friend! Yes, the Mamma is is there. Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful! Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite. You going to sleep here, all by yourself? And the lights! Running lights, stealing stretchers...! You'll have us in jail. Don't you agree, Jacques? ... It's easy. You go down. You come up. ... Right, Johana? Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8 o'clock in my suite? Listen to her! "That's what he's here for"! He's here to loose, that's what he's here for. First of all, I'm unbeatable. Second, how old are you? He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says: "I'm going to beat you". Huh? Well listen to him! Do you hear that? Italy! Exactly! What is it Johana? You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?! Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me. Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids. He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk. Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula! I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees. A new world record! That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow! You ever been to Tahiti? Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world. One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort... I might have known. As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver. Where did you two meet? A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent. It's the Free Diving World Championship. I am by the way world champion! This is a great pleasure. Enzo Molinari. You know each other? I tell you she's mine! In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction. Dollars. Ten thousand. How many are, down there? How did it happen? Is he here? "That"! This is not a "that"... I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down. I can take a five minute nap, can't I? Eh? Si! Avanti! Very chic. Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you? Find the Frenchman. Find me Mayol. A rosary for Mama, a dress for Then tell him to wax it too. Have the car painted. Roberto? How long? Hey! D'you have any other complaints? Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay? Try speaking to me? And... does the voice come back? What's with the voice? And where did you say you were from? ... What's your name again? Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?! It isn't lit yet. Plenty of women everywhere right? Jacques, take me back down... Please. ... Push me back in the water... ... It is much better down there. It's a better place. You were right. Well that's very nice of you. You say that because you have the title! I'm concentrating. Long enough to die. Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay? That's good. Thank you, thank you very much! It's never the sea! It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit! Jacques, what do you know? Anybody can have a bad day! I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn. You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable? ... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name! Let me tell you, time erases everything! So what!? His job is to hand out the paychecks. And he does that very well, let me tell you. No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep. Oh it's nothing. I knew it. I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good". I lost my title but I won a watch! You don't have that one, do you? You still collect them? Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it! Look here! Here... Here... The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes. You don't need a stretcher to take her with you. You know that, don't you? Hey! Will you slow down! When did you learn how to drive? ... I'm listening. Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente". So the trinket will just have to wait a bit. Look at me. These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks. How long can you hold your breath? As I said, second of all you're too skinny. You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick. Why? Everything about what? No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know? Ah ha. You finally want to know about women. Why? Then, it's very chic. Avanti! Get in the car! C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight. We have a new world champion. ... And his friend, Johana... Ahi, ahi, cazzo! Ma mamia! Where...? God, she'll kill me... ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant. What? Not at all! Forget it. I was joking. Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish. So, not married. Well, good for you. You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh? Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule! I was engaged... for a week. After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls. ... You married? How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well? Well, what are they? ... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right? Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! And you're throwing him out! Are you crazy, or what? Stupido! You don't have a room? Paolo? What did I just hear? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?! What room have you got? That's too easy! Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me: "D'you know that French guy, Mayol? He's supposed to be very good! Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure. ... I'll see you there... No. All you need is to want to be the best. Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me. They say I'm like Lazarus. You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?! I dove 315 feet! That's good. You never would have recognized me, huh? Check out the suit! Looking good, no? You know I'm the world champion? Jacques, my friend, how are you? If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you? You don't mind if I go instead, do you? Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman! How is the little Frenchman?Who? Tea... or whiskey? A drink to warm up? Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?I can't. ... I was right about what? No! I would never cheat you. It's not safe, they say. The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. Free diving is over as a sport. We can't dive anymore. They want to cancel the competition for a while. ... How long was I asleep? Enzo, don't be angry. I was lucky... that's all. Enzo, Enzo! Congratulations! I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you. Thank you. ... Yes. I don't want to erase anything. He doesn't like us. Can I come in? No. Thank you. It's really beautiful. Yes. What is it? What? Good night. Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road. No, I have to ask you a favor... You're the only one who'll understand. Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal? The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it! Two years younger than you. If we don't... I'm going to beat you. Well... about everything. ... Everything. Why? Are they what's most important? Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions. ... For the mermaids. No. I'm a little tired, I don't know if... Madame... Your mother? Enzo? You're staying at the hotel? No, no! People say that? Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men! No. It's okay. That's good. I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions. Yes, of course. Lots of questions. Enzo drop it, I'll find something. It's okay, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else. I don't have one. I remember. Hi Roberto! You're the best, Enzo! I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him? Why? Great! Yes, I know. Enzo... No... Fine! Anything. That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you. I saw how it has to be. Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one. ... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom. You want to lie down for a while? What's wrong? You go back, I'll walk. I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive. What? I don't know... it didn't feel right. I'm going to bed. I'm tired. I didn't dive. Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he? You'll understand. Absolutely positive. ... Not at all. Hello? You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out. They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere. If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever. Do you know how it is? Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid? Uh... Ah! A story? ... It's hard you know. You're so far away and I don't know what else to say. I'm still here. ... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too. How are you? Hello? But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right... I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about. Why? I did? Uh... Yes, of course! I don't know, I just feel it. She's not like the others. She can't stand to be away from the sea. ... The way she moves. ... No? You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me? I'm glad you stayed. Thank you. Give it to me. No. I want to show you. Is it ruined? My wallet. You jumped in? Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat. Thank you... It's too loud for me. Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it. It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous? Yes... Maybe... I don't know. I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun. Don't you think? I don't know... why? I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it? No, no. You'll like it. It's superb. But what brought you to Sicily? Please, have a seat. In the lake? I recognize you. Ah?! Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left? This is the hotel San Domenico? ... Are you sure? Louis, we were French! Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos? Uncle Louis, we have a guest! It's my apartment. Well... here. Uncle Louis! He doesn't hear too well. Johana... New York. No, no. Johana is visiting me. I brought Johana to meet you. Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana. What? No. You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.Let him sleep. ... Yes? Then, goodbye. Okay, okay. You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that? His mother's an American. He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you. Coffee might be nice. For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew. It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the night. He's in the fluoroscope now. Listen to his heart. Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore. It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now. He isn't going to breathe. My dear, science is a cruel mistress. In the spring when he melts! ... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse. We weren't able to save the equipment. Mayol... Jacques Mayol.Yes... It's magic. That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon. It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed. Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet. They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture. At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide. Of course, that's what they're for. They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship. Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years. Positive, Sir. Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.He's training. Where did you get that? The medics are looking all over for you. Enzo, wake up! What about the shoes? Yes? Enzo, really. What are you going to get? Santini will do that for 25 dollars! Enzo, what are you going to do with the money? Six seconds.What does that mean? You're going to hold me up at a time like this? Lira? The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up! Can you help?That's different! What's the matter with you? What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway? The whale! How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman! I'm going to put a lock on the telephone. Did you bring the cassettes? Liar! Thief! Torturer! When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast. In my apartment? Good. That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay? No, no. It's true. When I was in New York, oh boy! Before my accident, you understand? What kind of name is that? To be named after a city? Where are you from, Henrietta? Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident. Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz? Assassin! Where I saw the mermaids?! Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question! We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit! Why don't you ask me? Hey! Have you ever seen a mermaid? Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
