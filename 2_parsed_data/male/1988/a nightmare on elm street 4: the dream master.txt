You look great! What the hell was that? Something's wrong here. It feels like... You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before. As long as your driving doesn't kill us. Cut that shit out. Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side. Hey, you're not alone. We have to stop him, I'm with you. Who? Then what else can we do? Why can't we just talk to the authorities? Is there something we can do? Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you? How long have you been awake? No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow. Extra money, huh? Kristen's story really got to her. "In her dream"? I thought it was an accident. Smoking in bed. Tell him I was looking for him, okay? I'm Dan. You're his sister, right? About Freddy? How she doing? I ran into her last night. Hey man, we're all sorry... Nice neighborhood. So? So what's up? What'd I miss? I don't get it. Hey, Rick! T-T-Thanks Alice...Then we'll stay up together. We'll figure it out. I haven't slept much either. Since Kristen... Yeah, or turn you into toast. Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison? This looks like Sheila's. Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore? I heard you screaming. Was it a bad one? You alright? Kincaid and Joey died last night. Alice, you think you can leave? Never say can't. Just do what I do. Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back. Yeah. She'd be half as strict as you. The mirror. You can't see yourself in it. Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose? What else? You ever look over this town's history? Not a safe place to be a teenager. Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back. She's blaming herself for Sheila. I know how it feels. I've been thinking about Kristen. Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened. Been up with Alice. She knew she was gonna die. Now it gets weird. She says he comes back in dreams. If he kills you there, you're dead for real. It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive. She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality. Let me talk to you. Excuse me, ladies. I'll just be a moment. Earth to Alice... It's okay, babe. We're with you. I'll tell you later. I though Freddy was just an old town story. What is it? When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day. Avoid-all-contact-day.
