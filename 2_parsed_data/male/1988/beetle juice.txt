I will never sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara. Holding hands! And a good paintbrush! So do I, Jane. I'm on vacation. We're rich in what really matters. No, Jane. All right. Give or take a year. What time is it? What...? What makes you think she likes me? Let's see if she can get my model back. Little black party dresses? ... we wouldn't have had our little accident. I didn't -- But he didn't. We've got him where we want him. Maybe they'll leave now. That snake was a pretty nasty customer. N... No, I just did the Ink Spots. And your sushi was remarkable. But we let him out. Honey, I think that was a mistake. Go? What d'ya mean? We need help. ... acts like she's thirty-five. I guess we open it. Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig. Three times. Powerful number. Go ahead... third time's a charm. I didn't do that one... Hmmm. Of course I did. This is different. Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what? We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon. She's got photos , Barbara. Where are your skulls and bones? It's not stupid. We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years? Moan louder! Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really moan ! Practice, practice, practice. Look, she's right. We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident. C'mon. We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here. Barbara and I worked very hard on this house. How long do you suppose we were waiting? My God, we're back where we started. ... Not what I expected when we walked through that door. Wait. We need some help. I found something this morning. Here. Emergencies. 'In case of emergency, draw door.' Are you crazy? She can't hear you. What about this Beetle guy? There's nothing we can do. It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room. There goes my model. There goes our last refuge. That's all we need. She couldn't have. We can't make them see us. Nothing. The bio buster? I don't get it... Not really... what's this? You can't say that for sure. It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis. We just have to be tougher with them. Come on. Have some brandy. Spirits, get it? You left me. Barbara, honey! Don't go out there. You don't know -- Oh, honey, we may need that. I don't know if there's anything we can do. They make gypsies look good. That's my girl! Arrogant. That's Jane Butterfield all right... Won't? Or can't? I don't know. Jane, Jane, up here ! God, it's Jane Butterfield! But I'm not hungry, are you? Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me. As long as I never have to wash dishes again. Maybe this is heaven. Cabin fever, hon? I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.' This book reads like stereo instructions! Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.' This is going to take some time. This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know? This is going to take some time. Look at the publisher. Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press. Handbook for the recently diseased. Anything happen while I was away? ... Hmmm? What? You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something. I'll tell you what, Barbara. I don't think we survived that crash. You'd better sit down, hon. How's your arm? Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model. Yeah it turned out okay. We applied for a National Historical plaque for it. That'll be the third one on Main Street. Don't forget the balls, Ernie. Let's not think about it. We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation. Here comes the bridge chorus. We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house. Ah, the ever-tactful Jane. Let's just relax about having children. It's your turn, darling. God, how I have looked forward to this, honey. Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you. God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table and the cherry wardrobe! Manchurian Tung oil? Where did you get it? Almost. She's ready. Uh-uh. Only if you got above a C on science. We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me... Did you get the paint? What is going on? You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house. We weren't there. The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead. We want to frighten you away. So that you'll move out. I certainly did. I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much. We were trying to scare your mother. Nobody else can. You can actually see us? Without the sheets? What? Aren't you scared? We're ghosts. Wait for who? Help vouchers? Nine months? What difference does that make? W... We didn't know how to make one. Barbara ?!! This is my town. Okay. But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad. Can you scare them off? But... the Deetzes are destroying our house. You don't kill anyone. Aren't you dead? Out . Well, we didn't know -- Handbook? When...? And if we need you again, how do we...? We have to start simpler, is that it? We tried. Are you available?Now, let's get rolling! You wish! I nearly scored with that little blonde. I need me a short little queen. Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go! You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife. So what's my cut? So you, the dead, want me, the undead , to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump? Hell no! I'm rolling. I'm a businessman. I'm the man what am . Beee tel Jooose ! Who do I gotta kill? You lilly-livered bleeding hearts! Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years. I was out. Every dog has his day. This is my town. I need a night to howl. Folks, be reasonable here. I'm at your service. You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy. Try me. Hey you've been on Saturn! I hate those sandworms! Yecchhh ! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms. So a daughter? She got good legs? God I love a young leg. Bio- busting . I loves bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill? Family -- right? Obnoxious I bet. Mommie, daddy, piglets. You're the dead. All right. Who are you? I'm beeyoo-teeful. Then I'll help them. For a price. Can you help me ? So... You're ready for me now? How'd you like to be married to... the King...? How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world? Right now. I can do it if I get out. You've got to say it! Just say it. It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free. And then you'll be free. That's it! Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are dumb ! Good girrrl! It means look behind you, bimbo. No, dummy. Two. Of course you do. Minor problem. The rules. I can't tell it to you. But... do you know how to play charades? I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it. So simple . Say my name three times. That's all. I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style. That's right. They treat you like scum I bet? Well, yes, of course. It's great over here. You'll meet all the greats. James Dean. Buddy Holly. 'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.' You do? Over here? On my side? Sort of. High spirit. Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years. All I want is to get out. The happy hunting ground. Who cares? No, I mean they've gone. Decamped. Split. Vanished. Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski. They're dead.Otho? He's your cousin. Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here. I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable. That's fine, Otho. Just keep me out of it. I am here to relax and clip coupons. And goddamnit, I mean to do it. They're probably guilty about what they did to me. Why not? Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town. I need Max's financing... What's he going to do? Viciously rearrange their environment? At least insofar as we have our first casualty. Me. We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too. I saw a fly today. There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese. They don't know better. Otho, why didn't you just come in the door? Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us. Otho, could you actually... do something with them? I'll bring the wine... and the business plan. And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts. Delia will cook... Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately. I can make history here! I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park. Look at all that parking ! Answer your mother. The attic room is locked -- Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but -- ... sheets. Yes. Except when you creep around in your mother's -- Lydia. What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax? Go help your mother. Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here! What? ... asked you for something, didn't she? I'm going down to relax. I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand? Noise free. Skeleton keys never work. Anyway, this can wait. We'll get a crowbar later. Your mother... Let me have it. Lydia. Try to be civil. I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study. Where is your mother? Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be filled with people like us. Lydia, relax. We'll build you a darkroom in the basement. What do you think, honey? Are they suffering? Otho, can you do it? Great idea, Maxie! Those Japanese could run it for us. Build them a dormitory in the woods. Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you. Just a minute, Maxie. Somebody... No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans. You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it. Not a building ! That's the beauty of it. I think I can buy the whole town . These people don't know the value of their property!Yes... or no? Do you want the Deetzes out or in? Never trust the living ! We cannot have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death. Don't say his name ! Just practice. Do it yourself ! Start simply. Do what you know. Use your talents. Practice. We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time. And of course, practice, practice, practice. It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you? I heard. Tore your face right off! Bad news. It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you. The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all. Get 'em out yourself. It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy. Hell is other people. You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here. You should thank God you didn't die in Italy. The Deetzes. Okay. Have you been studying the manual? No. What's wrong? Forget him. He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him. You need to worry about people like Otho . There are a lot of phony trance mediums. They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you. As in -- exorcism . You people have really screwed up! I received word that you allowed yourselves to be photographed . And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook. The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture! We've got some serious talking to do. Yeah. He still tries popping up all over the place. But he can't join the party unless you call on him. Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go. He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker. He's pushy. He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years. No, you don't! He does not work well with others. No. You don't want his help. Pity. Murderers seem to have an easy time of it. Just look at Amityville. He was one of my boys. Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics. -- Like you used to be? What do you expect? You're dead. Yes. I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available. I'd nearly given up on you. I was about to leave. I do have other clients.It's too late, Charles. I'm sorry. I am ashamed to say he is. Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles. And Sarah? Forget it. You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives. He's a cloven-hooved beast! Yes, of course you are. Well, Otho had an intuition. Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house. And it certainly is. Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking from the ground ups'ville ! I don't know. Oh, they're still here. They're Just not showing up. Look at that detail ! We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair. We must protect them, treat them with respect, nur ture them. Oh, Delia, lighten up! Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts. I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door. You don't have a key? Let's see. We could turn that into a media room. 'I' will tell you what is boring. Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place might just be livable. What's on the third floor? Oh, as long as we're here... Is there much more of this torture? Be brave! Otho take care! Onward! I know ! We just have to pray that the other closets are bigger than this one. Blue-green! Hydrated chromic oxide! Remember I'm schooled in chemistry. I was a hair analyst! Briefly. Interior design is a science , Delia! Think of me as Doctor Otho. And this patient is truly sick ! Viridian? Gooood! You read my mind ! I love clients who can read my mind. I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural. I thought I saw something. No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say. Is the rest of the house as bad as this? That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence. As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again. Their wedding clothes. I'll need something personal of theirs. Perhaps if I were properly motivated. All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak. Where do they hide out? Why not? My sentiments exactly. Porcelain is for teeth! It's bad luck. And I believe hugely in luck.For Juno, your caseworker. Not that it matters to your type. But there are all these other people here ahead of you. I'd say three hours. D-90's. You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet. Good luck. You're going to use up all your help vouchers. You don't have an appointment, do you?
