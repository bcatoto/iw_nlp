Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises. I knew you'd come. Julia. I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty. Don't waste your tears. Look at him! 'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all. See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank. Shit. Bull. Shit. Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.? O.K. Let's go. WHY? Are you crazy? Yeah. The things you were talking about. The boxes! I TOLD you. The Boxes. In the House. I told you. The box? Like in your story? Like in his house? Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me. God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know. Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on... So you slept O.K.? If anyone can help, HE can. Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I... What? Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out. Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years. Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY. So... You're Kirsty, huh?Time to play. Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame. We have no more surprises. It's different for us. Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it. I... remember. Nonsense, I... What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank? Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell. No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining. But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours. Then why are you here?Who? Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now. What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it. Yeah. Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap. Oh, excuse me... What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion? Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story. You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
