I'm We're going the wrong way. Put that away. We'll look like tourists. We'll never get a cab here. Let's cut over to Seventh. Seventh is I know where we are! Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar? Mister. How about it. One dollar? One Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't scream. All right. The Gold Card. Don't leave home without it. Let's beat it, man. I don't like being up here. What, scared of heights? I dunno, man. After what happened to Johnny Gobs -- Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right? No big loss. That ain't what I heard. That ain't what I heard at all. I heard the bat got him. Gimme a break, will you? Shut up... Five stories, straight down. There was No shit. It was all over the pavement. There was no blood, man. My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and Listen to this. How old are you? There My brother's a priest, man. No wonder you're such a chickenshit. Now You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man. You shouldn'ta -- Do you want this money or I won't kill you. I want you to do me a favor. Tell your friends. Tell all your friends. ... it is no longer enough to go after the small-time punks and petty criminals who infest the streets of Gotham City. Crime and corruption must be attacked at the root! If elected, my first act as district attorney will be to return an indictment against Together we can make Gotham city a safe place for decent people to live and work and play. Decent people shouldn't live here. They'd be much happier someplace else. The usual gas. If this clown could lay a hand on Grissom... I would've had to kill him by now. Don't think so, angel. I'm too valuable. That's the way I've planned it. And besides, he doesn't know. ... I didn't ask. That one there won't say a word. The other one's raving his head off. Variety, huh? The spice of life. Great, but tell me: is this another you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's the third one this week. Good answer. I'm gonna put you in for a commendation. Oh Christ, it's Knox. Hiya, gents. This anything I should know about? Nothing out of the routine. A No offense, boys, but these guys are seeing No comment. Print what you like. Come on. One question. Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City? If so, is he on the police payroll? If so, what's he pulling down after taxes? You didn't show up. We had another bat sighting. I'm sure that was vitally important. Listen: things are heating up. Someone is leaking information to Harvey Dent. I'm doing the best I can. If it's a problem -- Eckhardt... our problems are your problems. I'll work on it. Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little ostentatious on a cop's salary, don't you think? I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to you. You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future. Ambition. Forget it, Jack. You'll never run that organization. And why's that? You're a psycho, friend. You're an A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows it. Here. Use mine. It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt here is a good cop. A real good cop. Inexpensive. What have you got for me, Jerry? Nice, but... maybe a little more gore on the fangs, huh? I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and dust him, okay? ... Vicki Vale. Honey -- I would know any randomly selected God, a girl could get hurt doing this. Got any more of those? It's too good, Vick. We got a six- foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers. Small so far. I mean -- they don't allow bats in boardrooms, do they. Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every law'n'order freak in the city's gonna be there. Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying -- Aw, Vicki. Vicki! Got a date? Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always loved you. Will you marry me? Well, I'm starving. Will you at least buy me a hamburger? Nine points ahead in the new poll. I don't like the way this is shaping up. We can always pop him. -- Or pop someone close to him. Let's feed him to the bat. He's going after our front companies. Specifically Ace Chemical. Which would tie us in with Councilman Kane, Senator Miller... on up the line. We have to clean out our files before the subpoena comes down. How do we go? The usual fire? I'm thinking break-in. Trash the office, remove the relevant documents... "Industrial espionage." That's right. And Jack -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally. ... Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd mind waiting in the other room. Why do you need Because I want someone I can I understand. Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck. My friend, your luck is just about to change. Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt. How high up would you say that is? I'd say about thirty feet, sir. You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment. Which bathroom is that, air? The small one. Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You actually Yeah, I guess we move in different circles. -- Though I Commissioner Gordon! What do you hear from our pointy-eared friend? Knox, for the ninth time, and you can quote me -- Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be How's your luck, Jim? Mr. Dent. What's Mr. Knox, I think we have enough real problems in this city without worrying about ghosts and goblins and Halloween characters. My question is, where does one man get all this Holy shit... Likes to kill? I bet they like him for his big charity balls. Well, you know me. The more they've got, the less they're worth. This guy must be the most worthless man in America. You disappoint me. Why not the world? I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host. Alexander Knox. Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work. I quite like it. Great. Give me a grant. I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale. "This is Miss Vale." -- You're just back from Corto Maltese. I saw your combat photos. Quite a departure for you. ... You have an extraordinary eye. Some people think she has I don't... seek publicity. -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while? Good. Then with any luck we'll run into each other. Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave -- Thank you, Alfred. I hope you'll excuse me. It was a great pleasure meeting you. And you. I know the rich are different, but that guy is What were you thinking? Well, Good Lord, it we could put our hands on Jack Napier... Why wasn't I told about this? Who's in charge of the -- Shoot to kill. Just like the file cabinets. I don't get it. If this place is cleaned out already, what do we need five men? What are you trying to do, blow the collar? You men are dismissed. We'll take over from here. Any man who opens fire on Jack Napier... will answer to me. You. Stick around. Freeze! Nice work, Commissioner. I'm in charge here. Not Carl Grissom. LOOK! My God... it's HOLD IT! Let him go or I'll do it. Nobody makes a move. We go out clean. ECKHARDT!! NO!! LOOK! HOLD YOUR FIRE! ... Who I don't know, but he's one hell of a showman. Commissioner. Do us both a favor. Don't tell me some Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up and asked you for a date?... Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter." Because that's the average length of his relationships with women. Tell her about the peanuts. Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes through Why? Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious. I do this for a living. -- What'd you tell him? ... What was Miranda, I'm busy. Go be productive. Too much work. I'm not really the physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred. Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops. Tell me, Vicki. There's something I'm very curious about. What took you down to Corto Maltese? You were one of the most successful magazine photographers in the city. Everyone wanted you. Not since the shooting started. What did you see? There's terror everywhere. Some types are just more -- Insulation? I think you see things very clearly. Do you assume that if I know you better I won't like you as much? Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. Because even if it doesn't sound that way...  that's how I'll mean it. Would you like me to take you home? Maybe we should just kiss. Well, Mr. Napier, let's see how we did. Mirror. You understand the facial muscles were completely severed -- -- you can see what I have to work with here -- I'm sure that with proper recon-- recon-- reconstructive surgery -- That you, sugar bumps? Who the hell are you? It's me. "Sugar Bumps." Jack? Thank God. I can't believe it's you. I heard you'd been -- Is that what you "heard"? Sooner or later you would've tried to take me, Jack. You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime. I've died once already. It wasn't so bad. -- In fact I Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal -- JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?? Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!! What a view. Our little city. It always brings a smile to my face. Guess it's I don't sing very well. ...Peanut. Here's that morgue file you wanted. Come on. Gimme some Miss Hunt! No need to sneak in. The rent's been taken care of. Honey -- I'm home! So that's how it is, gents. Until Grissom decides it's safe to come up for air... I'm running the show. So why don't we hear this from Grissom? I got something I'd like to know. How come you're wearing that stupid 'Cause I got an army, chum. And I got I don't like taking orders, from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's I've considered that possibility. And what happens if we say no? Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends. That's it? That's it. Looks like Carmine got a little hot under the collar. That's what they said about Lee Iacocca. Now GET OUT OF HERE. -- And I said I'd call you the minute I got free. And I did. -- And here we are. Vicki. Do you want the whole truth? All coyness aside? I wish I had more time to give you. Every day I don't see you, I miss you. Now. Are you going to waste this lovely afternoon being all mad at me? ... Looks like a Oh my God... are you all right? All I'm sorry, Miss Vale. I've given him your messages. That's all I can do. Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd like you to see. Okay, here we go. I guess so. Pulitzer Prize, 1963. Yep. He watched the whole thing happen. -- Recognize the beat cop? Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to? He walks out on his own party. Half an hour later, the Caped Crusader turns up in full bat-drag. Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway. No place to Oh? Why is that, Vicki? ... Okay, Vicki, I have a confession to make. Right. And Your little chum is out of his mind. Next time you call him up and he can't go How's that first shipment coming? Right on schedule. Oh, we got that address for you -- 79 East End, Mmm.

I kinda like this one. Leave it. I think it's safe to take that off. You're quite beautiful. Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it. You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know who A visual record, yes. A before-and- after kind of thing. This could ... Strong stomach, huh? I like that in a woman. -- Maybe we can do business after all. Jack?

I'll do your photos now. I have sponsors. I'm running a check on the tainted products. There I've tracked all the records. Every shipment, every warehouse, every loading dock. Nothing. No opportunities for tampering. Somehow the Joker is supplying tainted ingredients... at the source. Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos are ready.

You know the score. One column -- and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets once and for all. I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki. I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still out there. Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
