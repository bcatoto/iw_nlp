Go! Get up there Rachel! Get up there Rachel! Go! Shit! No. You son of a bitch! Get back! We're trapped in this house. Its metal, god dammit its metal. Is there another key? You think she stands a chance? Look. No, no, we have to get out of here right now. Who's that? What's going on? Are you two okay? I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all. I mean, you blew off our date at last minute. No, you don't understand. Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation. Okay, I guess. I'll call you later. So? Can I come over after Jamie's asleep? I'm not angry it's just Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit When did you find this out? So? What? Okay sure. What about? You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town. Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site. It's hard to tell, there all chewed up. Yes, sir. Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless. Give the troopers a chance to search. Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone. An accident? When did this happen? Now where are you going? Four plus Myers. Why shouldn't I? I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help. I can see this is useless. For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade. The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law. About what? Drive Carefully. I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands. If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die. Outside. Ready to go. Who signs for him? I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.Okay, out. Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that? You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers. Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids? Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers. We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station. Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason. Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.Got it Earl. Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster. Al here lost his boy 10 years back. What the hell did this? No way. No how. Who you calling? Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.Do you? Leave Myers for the state boys. Where are you going? Hell of a night. Maybe you ought to wait here till they do. Got it Ben. Isn't this all a little paranoid? What are we doing? Yeah in the trunk of my squad. I'll be there in 5 minutes. Ben-uh-I just heard about the station. 132 to 133 this is 134. No problem, Sheriff. Right here, Ben.Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will. How many bodies did you find? How many people in the bus? I don't want to have anyone live through that night again. We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs. You know damn well about what. You let them take it out of here. Why wasn't I notified? No. Yeah. We'll hear sirens soon. Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house? What are you doing out here alone? Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try. The state police won't know how to stop him. The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go. Its not over yet. They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory. Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs. How's it powered? Where's the radio? Where's that Deputy? You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got. It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill. Evil. It isn't a man. They didn't know what they were fighting. Dear God. Yes. Least I'm not alone. He's been here. When he makes that call. Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors. Its true, Sheriff. Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way. Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger. 10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter. He's here, Sheriff. Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield. Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ... I know that Mr. Sayer. What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer? Sort of. Loomis. Haddonfield. How far are you going, Mr. Sayer? Thank you.All right. Real charmer. Yeah. Should be on the road. A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove. Night Doc. Yeah. Well I guess your happy to see him go. Watch it. I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here. Michael Myers was his patient. Check him out. I do. Has he been prepped? Yes.Why don't you go make some coffee. All right. Good Good. Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key. Just do it. Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows. Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right. Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid? I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here. Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that? If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask. Making sure that no one can get in here. Get the outside shutters. Go get it. You got your riot gun? Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there. This is 132, over. You look sharp. You understand? Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back. These kids aren't likely to forget. It's over. Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited. This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me? Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs. Brady, you know how to use a gun? Be here in a minute. You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob. Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it. What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with? How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me. Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight. Oh Christ. Doc... Is that him? Is that him? This is starting to spook me. How do you know? Something? All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl. All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago? Hank, call the troopers and check his story out. And assuming what you say is true.. Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her. Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd? Why? That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid. Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years? I am. Ben Meeker. Jamie! Get away! Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right? Now you understand? All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan. Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!I'm not calling the fire department. I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet. How do you know their not? Why not? Found it. Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck. It's okay..it's okay.Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name. Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me. Car trouble? Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.
