I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about the safe. I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times. That's right, a tweeting bird. But what does the script say? 'Rabbit gets conked. Rabbit sees stars !' Not birds, stars! What's this, Roger?That's right, me. Surprised? Not for long. We're retiring the Red Cars. People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to. And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline. A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena. Pasadena to Hollywood. Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another. Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways. They won't care. Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future? It wasn't Toontown they wanted. It was my idea of how to put the land to better use. No one person is Cloverleaf. We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles. No matter. I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes. By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally. I've had enough of your insolence! Put him in my car. I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory. These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle. Well, why not? I'm feeling magnanimous tonight. The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector. Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting. But we'll let Santino handle that. You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant. Very pig-headed. Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station... Indeed we are. We'll continue the interrogation there. Oh, not that downtown. Toon town. Take it easy, Bongo. We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown. They? Marvin Acme had no will. I should know, the probate is in my court. Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective. What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant? So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be? Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work. The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he? Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon. He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back. Is that true?Uh, Eddie, do me a favor. Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion. Does it hurt? You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig. Boy, I'll say. They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo. Eddie? Jesus, what happened? Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.Jesus Christ... that was the Judge? What the hell is that? That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers. It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the... Final Solution. No one knows. He bought the election a few years back. He's been rulin' Toontown ever since. Wait here... They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day. Now what? Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.There's no time to take it easy! You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with! You tricked me, damn you! You got the will in there, don't ya? No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed. I just wanted to sell my studio. But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't. So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife. No... I'm not. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer. Valiant! You surprised me. Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing. Have you got the will? I've already seen your photographs. Valiant? What're you doin' here? Sure, Valiant, sure... Frankly, I'm shocked. Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years. When will I hear from you? I got him on loan from Disney. A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous. You don't have to. The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club. You can catch her in action there. Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with. Here's the problem... "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger". His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker. The doubt's eatin' him up. Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny. Yeah, and there's no business as expensive. I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why? How much do you know about show business, Valiant? So what? He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule! Valiant, did you see the rabbit?Don't worry about me. I can take it. Please, Raoul. I can give you stars, I know I can. Just drop the safe on my head one more time. A tweeting bird? From this box here... And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back. Think you'll keep it? I guess I am at that. Cigar? Hey, it's the will. I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters... Good idea. Yeah? That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink. Shows up three days later. Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose. Great gag. Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage. I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk. Yeah? Two bits. You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think. I tell you what, maybe I better come with you. Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya? Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock. Wrong number? I'll get it. Safe? Him? Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board. A Toon? Noooo. Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering? Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before. That your brother makin' the rabbit ears? Say, who's this guy laughin'? So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi? Valiant and Valiant? Who's the other Valiant? Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter... But, Eddie, you know what happens when... A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding. I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time. But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal! A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life. Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in. Angelo? He's a pal, a chum... But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre. Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh. Hey, don't I get an encore? Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious. What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him? How do you know that? The habeus corpus is thickening. I resent that innuendo! My wife is completely innocent. My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead. Well, no, not any time. Only when it was funny. Does this help? Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon. Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding... Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit. We always run. Don't do that! I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me. They were waitin' for me when I got home last night. I ran. Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner. He didn't know. Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way. He was very helpful. Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here. I needed a place to hide. I'm in trouble, Eddie. Aah! Divorce? Never! Pattycake! Pattycake!Yeah? Does he wear pants this color? So where is it then? My problem is I come here to drink in peace. So if you don't mind... You mean the rabbit? They got him cold. I know who you are. Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you? Big on the musical comedy, huh? Shoulda guessed. Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who's Mr. Jocularity? Wish I could say the same. What're you doin' here, Betty? That'll work out just fine. When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina. How does that sound? What've I got to lose? You okay, Dolores? I'll bet. Oh, no... What's that comin' from the bar? What the hell would they want with a gag factory? Maroon, right? Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife. That was the rabbit's wife. Yeah, do that. I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage. Then why'd they bother to crack the safe? You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open. Maybe Baby Herman was right. Somebody wants Acme's property. Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will. If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this. I oughta have my head examined. Will you hold still? Oh, yeah? Well, you're not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room? Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit. He's a Toon... who cares? Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores? Thanks for the vote of confidence. I don't wanna think. I wanna drink. No kiddin'? Bought the Red Cars, huh? What are you complaining about? Here's your fifty bucks. Check the scrawl. You'll have it in the morning. Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket. Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money. You? Not really. Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea. Holy shit, he's a Toon! That's what this is all about? Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country. What the hell's a freeway? Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone? Come on, Doom. What would a company like that want with Toontown? So you're Cloverleaf? The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal. Yeah? Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch. I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried. I ain't tellin' you nothin'! Get me Santino. You're not takin' me to downtown Toon town? Downtown? Fine. Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him. The other people who were in here lookin' for the will. I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me. They must've taken it off me. He had a will, all right. She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off. Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall. Ask her... Have you tried Walla Walla? Kokomo's very nice this time of year. Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures. Men? They look more like weasles to me. Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer? He's not my client. I was workin' for R.K. Maroon. Not much. It's hard to talk. No... What am I, Earl? Toon cops worked me over. Earl... it's me, Valiant. Hold on a second. Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway? A joker to the end. So where is it? How did you get onto Doom? He's right here in the... We're even. By the way, I did find your husband. Why didn't you tell me? Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong. You shot Roger. Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills. I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder. So altruistic. I'm not complainin'. But give me credit. I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember? Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do. Oh, sure. I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home. Yeah, I'll bet you would. You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work. No? I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder. Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before? Okay, you've seen me. Now give me a towel. That's because I don't have a doorbell. Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood. I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will. Doom. What's with the dip? Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway? What a gasser. Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile. That's what you woke me up for? Take it easy. No, I don't. Well, everybody needs a hobby. You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.? That was the idea. Stop what? Maybe. Why? Maroon? Whaddaya want? Yeah, but I enlarged this one. Thought you might be interested. I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph. Hi, Mr. Maroon. Remember me? Son-of-a-bitch... Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee... Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black. As soon as is humanly possible. Aren't you the lucky one... So's the job. The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks. I don't work in Toontown. So what do you want me to do? One too many safes dropped on his head? Only there's no business like it, no business I know. He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what? Pretty good cigar. Where'd you get it? Only time will tell. By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife. She's a good lady. I'm glad you got her back. No, kid, you're a real hero. Keep reading... I think you oughta read it to her. Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club? Yeah... That's not blood. That's ink. That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day. Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know. Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over. What the hell are you doin' in there? ... I'd head for Cucamonga. If I don't make it back here by ten... I rest my case. How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger? Forget it. That's why I'll be there at 8:45. No, it's not. Get away from there. Piano. Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown. Nobody ever saw him again. Yeah, everybody thought so. But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons. All Toons. We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case. But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all. We went to his house to take him in. But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally. Yeah, a Toon. It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother. You wanna know? Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya. One of you Toons killed my brother. You damn Toon! No wonder they picked you for the patsy. Always gotta play the fool. You make me sick! What is this, Twenty Questions? Me. We can't do anything till it's dark. My brother. Get inside. If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon? Drink it, jerk. All of it. Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me. I think you want a drink. How about it, Judge? Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request? Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal. I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety. Just because you got 'em to laugh? An arsonist and a kidnapper. He just got outta prison. And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops. That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel! Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you. I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'. Because he's not forty feet tall. The safe was up on the ceiling, remember? Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club. It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body. Yeah. Except they screwed up. I don't think they got the will. Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them. Yeah. I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body. Yeah... well you just might get your wish. Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder? You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time? Yeah, that's better. Don't ever forget that. Hey! What do you think you're doin'? You idiot. I lost the key for those cuffs. If you're so innocent, why'd you run? Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police. In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here! Out! Get out! Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house? So I hear. Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting. What the hell are you doin'? Aah! My advice? Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce. Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
