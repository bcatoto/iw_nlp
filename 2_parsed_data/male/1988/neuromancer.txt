Ghost a steppin' razor... What you lookin' for, mon? Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon. Straylight. Kitchen dock. Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of. The Elders, mon...Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode. The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace. They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks. He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke. An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable. Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin. Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you. What? Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer. You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man. Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape. Alright. Let's talk business. You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes. You've got your orders. What are you talking about? Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe? We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night. Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite. Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier. That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa. You see the couple up in the balcony? Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn. You'll be linked during the entire operation. Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems. Prepping your trip. What about McCoy? Did you trace it? What's this? Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation. You ran without us. Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know. You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates. Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct. Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's. I know. You ever work with ghosts, Case? I've arranged for him to work with us. Dixie McCoy It hasn't yet. This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus. The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I. There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job. Good, because you've got a new one. You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain. I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun. Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many. We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance. First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me. What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage? If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur. Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that. Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with. The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise. Very well. Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close. A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen. What the hell is that? I'm getting used to it. Where are we? If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not. Can you get us into Straylight? What are you doing in here? I find out now. This ain't Bangkok, chief. The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run. As long as you cooperate. I want it now, Armitage. Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake. That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long. The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone? He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.? Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream. Yeah, well it's working. Linked? That could work, but the timing will be a bitch. Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier. He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly? Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear. No, but it traced me. Could be your A.I.'s calling card. What's he doing to my gear? I cannot tell a lie. Sorry. It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on. And then? Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else. What are you talking about? That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him. Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know. I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one. Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct. First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em. Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice. Why'd you do it, Armitage? You son of a bitch... Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency. I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body. Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting? It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies. Terms? Then I'd ask you what your terms are. I'd say you were full of shit. My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else. Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf. What does this have to do with me? You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is. Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run. What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me? The access code to your mainframe. Tell me the words. Are you even really alive? Can you read my mind? I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest. Yeah. You're pleasant tonight. I don't have a girl. Fine, Ratz. Thanks. Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct. Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works? That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember? As far as they know, that's absolutely true. Yeah. That was me. Fine, Dixie. Fine. It's Case. Remember me? Maybe so... Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio... If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it. We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down. Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth? Ready? Can you walk? The girl 3Jane. We need her. We're doing fine. Take the next right. I an' I, man. I an' I. Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it. Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers? She's ready to go. What elders? What about the route to the core? Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie. I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man. It's coming. How's the ice? Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll. Less than thirty minutes. Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown. How long, Dixie? How's the ice break? Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea? I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix. You can make your move when it comes after me. We run. You crack the pattern? We got problems topside. The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern? No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful. So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense. Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him. Bright enough to be dangerous. It's mutating... spreading like a disease. I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern. Can you take me to it? How are we doing? What? What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it. I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.? Nobody has. A guy who calls himself Armitage. I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives. What? You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special. Right... Want to fucking answer them? The angels... I think they're calling your name. Wait... You hear that? What about the mainframe's access code? Case. I don't know. I don't know... Where did you here that? I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me. Why did you come here tonight, Linda? I thought you already left. I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker. I think you're full of shit. Why would you want me to kill you? Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out. I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch. And Linda... You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed. I know who you are. I'm still going in. Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it. Shit... Or a little self-indulgent to say the least. No we don't... Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen. The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it. Is he going to make it? No. It's important to be able to feel those things. We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon. I know you have. C'mere. What went down between you and Riviera? That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo. Something exotic I hope. I'll be okay. Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine. Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on. Yeah... fine. They'll cut you down. I don't sleep much. You packed? Shhh... ...Feels like you. It sounds like you. Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here. ...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history. The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back. Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes. The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything. Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight. Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him. When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action. On a good run... yeah. I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me. I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck. I'm going in. What the fuck... are you serious? The way I feel, believe me, it'll help. How soon is soon enough? I gotta know... did it work> How long have I been out? Holy shit... What? Maybe something's onto him. Then you don't really know who he is, do you? What about before that? He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him? Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese? Then, fuck you. I'm gone. ... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip. What's my end? Why should I want to meet him.Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct. Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck... Ya learned good. So, what's happening? Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura. Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it. Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid? Hey, bro.Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have? Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts. No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste? I saw your girl yesterday. Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
