Let's go. Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan! You're chasing a dream. You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army. Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone? It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan. What did you do this time? You managed alright. Hey, remember? You don't need my help, Madmartigan. Little rabbit trap like this? Come on! I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you! I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage. Madmartigan! What did you do this time? We're going into battle, little one. Find a woman to take care of it.Waste magic on revenge? You have much to learn, Willow... Go in the direction the bird is flying. Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others. You lack faith in your- self. You must learn to trust your intuition. You're strong enough. But you're going to need courage, Willow. Now, you know where you're going? Down there, through those trees, follow the river. You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture. Willow, this is serious business. Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn. Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can. Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow. Not today, Willow.Thank you, friend. Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk? Just get me some horses. Then come with us. They're not after me. They want the baby. Is this what's left of your army? You left me to die, friend. Gimme a sword, Airk. I'll win your war for you. Airk! Come on, Airk. Lemme outa here. Least I'm not down there herding sheep! Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place! He thought you were a woman, Airk! We'll probably die here, Sorsha. Sorsha. Because it's true. Say what? I'm not going to let this baby die. Too bad you're not more like your father. Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman. Gawd...you're...beautiful... Why not? I can't. I can't. No. I mean yes. Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel? We're a tiny version of all that? Who is that girl, anyway? Then you get us out of here. He turned that monster into stone! Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here? I don't know, Willow. Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture! Watch it! She's a bird, Willow. Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong? Want me to carry Elora? What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents? She's in love. Well what did she say? Willow! Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time. You were in her ten all night. Did she say anything? Did she ask about me? I'm beginning to think you two deserve to be locked up. I won't. Yeah me. King! But she betrayed me. She robbed me of my dream. I was in love once, Willow. She had a hold on my heart. I could barely function. I was a great swordsman! I was knighted! I could have been king! My help? A great magician like you? You don't need any help. The Fairy Queen? And the baby here's a princess? And these two rodents are your guides? So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh? I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist. I did? When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf! Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...! I thought you had her! Because she's sick. Time to leave. These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids. Where the hell did you come from? Don't worry, Willow. She's in good hands. You haven't made a mistake. Of course! I promise! Absolutely! I will. Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why? Nobody cares... Except me. You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own. Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow? I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk! You slime! When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole! You hear trouble. The greatest swordsman that ever lived. Smells like a battle. These burns. My arms. Ouch... Farmer! I knew it! You're a vic- tim, Willow. Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world. You a woodcutter? As if you care. I saved your life, Peck. Those guys woulda killed us! You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies! Thanks for your help, Peck. Peck! Quick! Douse the fire! Why. Miserable Pecks. Don't make me angry, Peck. Please? I'm dyin' of thirst in here.I could be you rguard! I could carry your spear! Are you scared? Dada, what's a daikini? Can't we keep it, Dada? It's not a Nelwyn baby.Ouch! Let go of me! Us?? We'll never catch them. Any- way, we're all done, Teemo. Let's go home. Yes! Raziel! She lives out on that island! Me neither! He never misses. Somebody has to do it.Get back here, Rool! We gotta follow them. Are you sure? I'm not going in there. Watch this. Right between the eyes. Elves! They're always tormenting babies. They make them cry and take their tears. Queen Bavmorda transformed her. Obviously. The sorceress. Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold. Hey, careful there! Talk! Say something! Hurry! Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do. Take your time. Don't worry about the elves. They won't come out here. No! You let us handle this. Come along, Rool! You're the guardian, aren't you? She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess. We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.They look like acorns. Why can't you do it? You have mag- ical powers. No I'm not. Have you really looked at me? I'm short! Even for a Nelwyn! You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody. What is Tir Asleen? Me? You mean, you know who this baby belongs to? Yes...? Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad! I don't want courage. I don't want to be a warrior. All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you! If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this? My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin. It's a matter of great importance to me! Sir! I have to talk to you. Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter. She is all that matters. Are you going to abandon her? I know, I know! But this is a way to get into that castle... I have an idea. Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs. Ahhh! That's my fault, not hers. I've got to keep practicing. I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and-- She can't be wrong. She's a very very very powerful sorceress. I'm used to her. How's she doing? Madmartigan! I can't stand being in closed-in places. You? You're crazy. I think you're in love. She asked about you, Madmartigan. She said lots of thing.s Who? The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan. I'll help you...! You? Madmartigan, I need your help. Yes it does. The Fairy Queen told me. Madmartigan! You saved her life! Elora Danan! Where's the baby?? Because she's sick. Time to change her diaper. Nursemaid?! Hey! Give me that baby! You!! Here are her diaper rags. And this is her milk bladder. And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder. She likes that. And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold. And keep her diaper changed. Fresh goat's milk. You gotta promise to feed her. You don't know anything about ba- bies. I hate this. Friend of yours? What is it? What's that? I hear something! Are you a warrior? You all right? Farmer. I don't know. Are you okay? Hey! Somebody's coming! I have to give this baby to some- body. Do any other daikinis ever come by here? You be careful. I'm a powerful sorcerer. I could turn you into a toad just like that. Good. How long will it take? What a great son you are, Ranon. I wish I could take you with me. Now go to sleep... Daikinis are giant people who live far far away. Absolutely not. No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby. It looks like a daikini... Courage, Willow. Surrender!! She's too powerful, Raziel I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die! Why? Raziel! I transformed them all! I'm a magician! I did it! Madmartigan! Come here! Look! You gotta see this! I did it! How?? There's nobody here. I just wanted to test it first. His will. What'd you bit me for!! Ouch!! Oooh, this smells terrible. But what am I gonna transform?? I can't remember all these things. What am I learning? The limitless power of... I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality! How am I gonna do that? I'm all finished. Now what? I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it? I hope she's all right. How much more do I have to do of this? What do I need for that? That's all I ever wanted! No. No! We need your help. To take this baby to Tir Asleen. She's a prin- cess. I'm Willow Ufgood. I'm here to find Fin Raziel. Here. Hold her. She's hungry. I don't know much about him. Madmartigan. She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby. Soon the baby stops crying. Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire. Then his eyes focus on the fire. She needs to be changed. If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying. This can't be right. This isn't a sorceress. This is some kind of animal. Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen. We'd better go. We've traveled a long way. We're looking for Fin Raziel. How are we going to get out there? How do these work I wonder? I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin. I can't see anything--she's too bright! This is not going well. Why not? Ohhh, I hate this. I'm getting her out of there! Who?? Queen Cherlindrea?
