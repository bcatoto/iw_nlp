Morning, folks. Can I help you? Yes, please. I... er, we... are  looking for the rental agent here.  We have an appointment. OK, I'll just give him a little buzz  and he'll come out and show you the  way in. Darned thing. Do you ever use that? This? No, never even had it out of  the holster. A rival company has  'em, so we gotta have 'em. Just an  advertising gimmick. Here's Mr. Merrick. He'll take you  on in. Welcome to Starliner Towers. And you  are...? Kresimir and Benda Sviben. Eh? Oh yes, of course. Mr. and Mrs.  Sweden. Come right this way. Sorry  to keep you waiting. Now, are we  talking about one or two bedrooms? I  assume we're not talking about  bachelors, eh? Ha, ha. Now, I have  several floor plans all laid out for  you, and all you have to do is take  your choice and we'll trot right on  up there and take a look at 'em... Now you take a look at that one,  Brenda, and tell me if it doesn't  suit you down to the ground. That  one has the big view, the panoramic  view... What do you want to call me at the  office for? I won't be at the office except to  sign in. I've got a lot of claims to check  out. All over the place. Garages and  more garages. I'll come home right after work. We're going up. Oh. Well, I'll go along for the ride. Wood-grain paneling, strong, silent,  fireproof, fast, cushioned ride.  Everything you could want in an  elevator. Notice how the entranceways to all  the apartments are recessed and  individually lit... Nope, it's down  that way, Brenda. That's it...  Recessed and individually lit... Like I said to the police officer,  he paid the rent, Dr. Hobbes did.  And he came around and chatted a lot  with everyone here, the staff, I  mean. Nice guy. Not a high and mighty  type. But it was her name on the  residency list and the buzzer board:  Annabelle... what was it again?...  Annabelle Horsefield. She never  complained about anything, not to  me, anyway. And that was her. Annabelle Horse...  field. Far as I know, yeah, that was her. Is that the man who called you up  here? Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the  head of our little medical clinic  here. Medical clinic? Yeah. This is an island, you know?  Takes too long to get into the city.  We gotta have everything right here  or somebody complains. Well, let's go talk to your doctor. Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant  Heller. I'd like to ask you a few  questions. Sure. You're the one who found the bodies? Yes. Did you touch anything? Move anything  before we got here? No, nothing. You knew these people? I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor  and a professor at university. I saw  the girl around the building but I  didn't know her. She never came to  the clinic. So you just came up to visit this  Hobbes and you found them like that? Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes  since I was in medical school. He  taught me... he was my prof in urology  and... I think he conducted a few  seminars in psychopharmacology. That  was it. I had no idea he'd ever set  foot in Starliner Towers until today. I see. Then what brought you up here? It was very strange. He called me at  six this morning. Hobbes called me.  I thought I was dreaming. I haven't  heard that voice for so long. He  told me who it was, then he said  something like, 'Meet me at apartment  1208 at noon. I want you to go out  for lunch with me. It's time you  furthered your education.' Then he  laughed and hung up. I went back to  sleep. He called me again at eight  to remind me to come. How did he sound this time? Was he  nervous? Depressed? He sounded fine. Who? No, that's not me. You got the  wrong guy. Just a sec. It's for you. Somebody wants to know  how come you didn't show up for lunch. Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes  would have laid on you, Rog, but  it's all I got, and... ...all I got I share with you. Go  ahead. Take all you want. You touch my spleen, Rollo. And here all the time I was thinking --  if I ever bothered to think about  the good old days -- well, at least  there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's  happy. I'm still a VD man under the skin,  Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth  kinda guy, right? Well, at least you still talk the  same. So who changes? But you gave up your private practice.  Suddenly you're into pure research  and you... you're what, a  parasitologist? That was my father's idea... private  practice. He wanted to set me up --  I couldn't say no. But he's dead  now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I  gotta do research. Look at that  beautiful stuff... ...lookit it! This is the 'Satyr's Tongue'! The note includes a warning against  swallowing the tongue whole, but we  don't see the rest of this caution.  'Satyr's Tongue' was Hobbes's code  name for our project. What we were  trying to do was to find an  alternative to organ transplants. I know. You're bored already.  Transplants are yesterday's kishkas,  right? Did I say anything? Look. You got men, you got parasites  that live in, on, and around men.  Now. Why not breed a parasite that  does something useful? Eh? Why not  breed a parasite capable of taking  over the function of any one of a  bunch of human organs? Why not, for  example, a parasite living in the  human abdominal cavity that plugs  into the circulatory system and  filters the blood like a kidney? If  it takes a little blood for itself,  so what? Be generous! You can afford  it. You put the bug into the body of a  man with a diseased kidney, the bug  attacks the bad kidney, dissolves  it, it's assimilated by the body,  and now you got a perfectly good  parasite where you used to have a  rotten kidney. I know what you're  gonna say. You're gonna say it's  crazy. It's crazy. Right. It's crazy. But here's the  beauty part. Ready? Who cares? I don't get it. You know and I know that Hobbes was  a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry,  academic, afraid of women, lousy.  But he was always a genius at one  thing -- getting grants. Could he  get grants for crazy projects? You know who pays the rent here? Eh?  The Northern Hemisphere Organ  Transplant Society. And that's for  something that's supposed to put  them outta business. And they're not  the only ones. We got grant money  coming out of our ears. See? There? You take a little of  this... that's a very rare venereal  disease you get in the nomadic Crinua  people, Northeast Asia and Japan. Oo. That one's got it bad. They call  it Batinh. That means 'kiss' or  'caress.' When you get it it makes  your lips itchy, ya wanta kiss  everything. I even had it once. I  always get everything at least once  so I know what the patient's talking  about. And there... you take a little of  that... that's beautiful, isn't it?  That's Flexipes, the world's only  cephalopod parasite. That's him right there. Not a very  good specimen. Related to squids and  octopuses. See? He lives in the guts  of whales and big dolphins. Ya like 'em big 'n hot 'n wet, don't  ya? Yeah. We don't do it all here, we send out  to have tricky stuff done... the  cell fusion, enucleation, chromosomal  fission, all that fancy close work. Rollo, how come Hobbes killed himself? Funny in the head. High suicide rate  in the medical profession. Too much  body, alla time bodies, bodies. Rog, I gotta talk serious to you.  Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I  want you to come into this with me.  To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm  lonely. All Hobbes ever did was run around  getting money and phone me in the  middle of the night. He wanted you  in anyway. That's why we were gonna  get together, the three of us. We  would have enough to keep us going  for at least five years, even with  inflation. Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always  a GP. You want to help sick people for the  rest of your life? God forbid I should  talk you out of it. You oughta be careful yourself. Might  end up cutting your throat. It was women did it to Hobbes.  Couldn't handle them. That girl,  that Annabelle -- talk about crazy  projects. Who was she? Aw, he met her when he was lecturing  at some private girls' school. They  caught him examining her little tits  for breast cancer in the faculty  lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask.  It was craziness, believe me. They used to come here sometimes. Don't ask. I'll never really understand how he  could do what he did to her. Well, Rollo Linsky... I gotta go  open up the store. It's been great  to see you again. Yeah, sure. But you'll think about what I said  about working together, huh? OK. I'll think about it. Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of  my hands. That's all. No, no. I'll be all right. I'm all  right. Call me a cab, will you please, Mona?  I'm going home for the day. I don't care what you think. Please  call me a cab. Now. ...and this Kriedler seems to think  that mega-vitamin therapy may be the  answer to the question of aging.  That's not to suggest that the aging  process is in any way reversible --  I don't think for a minute that it  is -- but it may be stoppable, and  that's where mega-vitamins come in... Afternoon, Mr. Tudor. Well, there's certainly nothing here  in this check-up I did for your  husband's company last year. Blood  pressure a touch high, cholesterol  count nice and low... I just can't see cancer developing  that fast, Janine, not the way you've  described it. Could be swollen glands  or something, I don't know. If he can't make it down here...  sure. That's what I'm here for. But  it won't be until, oh... ...9.30, say 10.00. OK? Not too late? Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec. You don't have to go. I'm not shy. Aw. Poor birdie. They're always  crashing into tall buildings. It's  such a shame, such a shame. The  windows fool them, you know. Come along, Olive. Oh, Vi! Maybe the poor thing's just  been hurt. Maybe we should look for  him! Don't be silly, dear. It's in heaven  now, whatever it is. Won't help at  all for you to get into a fuss and  muddle over it. Now come along and  let's finish up our little evening  stroll and get you tucked up in bed  in front of the color TV. You know what a restless night you  have if you don't get your two hours  of color TV, dear, so let's bustle  along and get our walk over with,  shall we...? Ow! Better take it easy. There's a  lot of pressure in there! Want me to breathe deeply? Just breathe normally. Good shape for an old man, eh? Mr. Parkins, what makes you think  you caught these lumps of yours from  a young lady? She had a couple just like them.  Right here near her belly button.  You could push 'em around. I thought  they were kinda sexy, myself. Didn't she ever have these lumps  looked at by a doctor? Didn't seem worried about them. Was this girl from Starliner Towers? Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually  went to my place. Bigger liquor  cabinet, bigger bed. She was gone when I got back from my  last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a  beautiful tan. Must have gone home to mother. Was her name Annabelle Horsefield? That's the one. OK, you can get dressed now, Mr.  Parkins. I'm going to send you to the hospital  to have a few X-rays taken. I want  to find out exactly what you're hiding  in there, OK? Give them this. The  address is right there under  Radiology. Gonna cut me open? Well, let's wait for the X-rays. Used to know a doctor who said he  got to know his patients better than  their wives did. Cutting a man open sure does expose  more of him than pulling down his  pants, gotta admit that. I can't, dummy. He'll see that the  pack's been opened. You're such a  dumbhead. Buy 'em with what, dumbhead? I dunno. Guess the milk went bad. It's still worth money. Let's get outta here before somebody  hears us! Come here, boy. Here, boy, here. Come on, fella. Thataboy. You and  me, we're gonna be friends, aren't  we? No, no, no. Don't run away, boy. I'm  not going to hurt you. Not going to  hurt you. We're going to be friends.  Friends. Attaboy. Attaboy. Go away. Leave me alone. Attaboy, attaboy. OK, Dotty. Everything else seems to  be fine. Now if it gives you any  trouble at all, any sharp pain, any  unusual discharge, you come and see  me right away. They can be tricky  sometimes. That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks. Uh, OK. Sure. C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more  on the list? Yes? That you, Rog? Yes? It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me? Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking  about you. Been glancing at some of your  publications on your work with Hobbes. Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you  won't find any real meat in them. No? How come? Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny,  you know? I told you that. But I  didn't really know just how funny he  was. See... when he kicked off, they  sent all the personal secret stuff  they found to his mother -- she's  still alive but just barely -- and  she sent everything she thought was  medical to me here at the lab. I'm  Hobbes's partner, right? Anyway, I've been going through his  papers, and what they add up to is  this: Hobbes was shafting us all,  me, the university, the foundations  and the councils, the private labs,  everybody. We never really knew what  it was we were working on. Hobbes  gave us each a few crumbs, but he  was the only one who knew what the  whole loaf would look like. OK, I bite. What does it look like? It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a  disease to save man from his mind.' I don't get it. Lemme clarify for you. Hobbes thought that man is an animal  that thinks too much, an animal that  has lost touch with his instinct,  his 'primal self'... in other words,  too much brain and not enough guts.  And what he came up with to help our  guts along was a human parasite that  is... lemme find it here... 'a  combination of aphrodisiac and  venereal disease, a modern version  of the satyr's tongue.' But the important thing for you is  this: Hobbes used Annabelle as a  guinea pig. He implanted her with  the thing. I figure that once the  parasites took, Annabelle went  berserk. I dunno what she did, but  Hobbes wasn't ready for it. He had  to kill her. And he wasn't trying to  burn her, he was burning them, all  of them. He didn't make it. Huh? Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but  Annabelle was a pretty popular girl  around Starliner Towers. I've got  three men here, maybe four, who're  hosting large, free-moving, apparently  pathogenic, abdominal growths that  nobody I've tried can identify. You  were next on my list. I'd kinda like to come over there  and have a look at one of these guys. I've got a date with one of them at  ten. Can you make it? Yeah. Ah, I don't want to panic you or  anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes  designed them, they're supposed to  get out of hand real quick, so you  don't have much time to think about  what's happening to you. Once they  decide to start pumping all those  dynamite juices into the old blood  stream... I dunno. But if you see  some people doing kind of compulsive,  maybe even bizarre sexual things... Yeah? What do I do then? I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you  can get at them, there's a lotta  stuff you can use. I'll bring a  bagful. It's just the standard  tropical kit. But the trick is to  get at them. OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower,  Starliner Towers. May as well go  there directly. OK, Rog. See you at ten. Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take  a while. No. I don't think so. OK. But late. Lovely, lovely evening. Very quiet,  eh? Yes... you can... help me. Oh, my darling, I worship, I worship  at the shrine of your body, your  body, your body, oh, your body... Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong?  What's happened? Where is he now? Do you know? Will you be OK now? I've got to go  to your place to see if he's still  there. I've got to see if it's... if  it's what we both think it is. OK, c'mon. Here, here. What is this all about?  What's the matter with you? What are  you doing in there? Hey, that's enough, enough of this  nonsense! What is this? Hey, Doctor, Doctor! Please. Help  us! What happened? Please pardon me. I am Niccolo  Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I  don't know... we were walking in the  hallway and... Cabiria... my wife...  she was attacked by this thing...  here, on her arm. It's all right, cara mia. What's one  more scar to an old lady, eh? You'll  be OK. Where is this thing that attacked  your wife? I hit it. I hit it with my cane.  Then I carry it on the cane and I  throw it down to the incinerator,  down to the garbage. This is Nurse Forsythe. She's a nurse,  you understand me? Go back to their apartment with them  and treat her for second-degree burns.  It'll have to do for now. What's your number? The number of  your apartment? We live in 703. OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't  leave until I get there. Lock the  door and don't open it except for  me. OK? Down to the incinerator. Janine. Janine. Come here. Come into  the bedroom, Janine. Hello, darling. I feel wonderful.  Come and sit beside me, beside me on  the bed. Do you want to make love? You're  absolutely beautiful, those eyes,  that expression. You're absolutely  the most sexy thing alive. Do you  want to make love? You will make love to me, won't you,  Janine? Won't you make love to me?  You start it. Won't you? I think  I've forgotten how to start. Please, Janine. Please,  pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine  JanineJanineJanine... Love me. Oh, Janine, you're so  beautiful. You're my wife. Mmm. You're  my wife. You're my wife, Janine. Please make  love to me. Make love to me, make love to me,  love, love to me... Ooooooooooooooooo! Janine, Janine, Janinnnnnneeee! Miss! Nurse! Come back! Cabiria, she  needs something...! ...haven't seen anything that looks  like trouble at all. Just filling in  for Walter... the doorman. But if  you want me to call the police, I  will. Apartment 307? Visiting my sister. Yes? Who is there? It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let  me speak to the nurse, please. Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I  think she must go to look for you. Evening, Mr. Wolf, Miss Lewis. I  wonder if I could talk to you for a  second in my office? Well, there may be a connection.  See, it's about your locker. 'Fraid  somebody busted into it tonight. 'Fraid so. I've got a few of the  things they threw around in my office  and if you could identify it... Rollo'll be here soon. Rollo'll be  here soon. Hello, good evening, is anybody here?  Dr. St. Luc? It's Dr. Linsky here to  see you for consultation. It's Dr. Linsky. Anybody home? Is that Mr. Nicholas Tudor? It's Dr.  Linsky. I'm meeting Dr. St. Luc here.  He must be a little bit late. Is anyone here? Nicholas Tudor? Is  that you? Tudor? Mind if I have a  look at you? Just a peek, OK? A little peek won't  hurt. No, no, no, no. Mustn't, mustn't.  You mustn't kill them, no, no, no. No, no. You mustn't kill them. That's  my blood you're spilling! My blood!  Let them come home, let them come  home, home, home inside me. Don't  kill them...! At least save me one! For God's sake!  At least save me one. One, one, one,  one... Can you walk? I couldn't find anything  wrong with you. Rollo and the police should be here  by now. It's just a question of  avoiding infected residents until we  find them. Forsythe! Forsythe! Have you seen the police? I'm Dr.  St. Luc. Have you seen the police?  Have they come? A kiss, a kiss, a kiss! Nobody should be alone! Nobody should  be alone tonight! Nobody alone! Nobody alone!
