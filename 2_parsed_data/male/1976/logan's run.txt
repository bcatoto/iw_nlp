Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth! Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go! For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman! I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea. It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they... ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea. Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started. Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you! Up there. Nude. Imagine, a pair. Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone. Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful. You're a beautiful pair. Never a pair. I have never had a pair. Is that the wind? Not yet... You must hear my birds sing. Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding. From? From? From? You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember? Anything to eat? Your turn. Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken? I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either. No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?Hurry... hurry... hurry. Do you have anything special in mind? Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me. I designed it myself. What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job? And I did it myself right on there. I am. It's a real privilege, Sandman.Why did you do that???!!! Why did you do that??!! What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go? I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!! What's going on, Logan?! At Carousel tonight? Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do. Of course. I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions. What the hell took you so long? You? Why? You're already beautiful. Yes. But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering? I'm in my party mood. Only a few? You're just not trying. Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think... The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade... You missed something special. I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was? I never even visited Nursery before tonight. When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know? Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman. Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea? Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out? Why? Not in my time... You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate... your alert successor... Logan-6. Had enough? Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out. You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect. I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand... So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep? You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here. If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart! Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? What happens when you're sixteen and you go green? No, for you! How old are you, Billy? I feel sorry for you, boy! I'm a Sandman! What other food? How did they get in here? We're ready. All right. Now you keep your bargain. How do you want us? It'll be all right... That's better. How do you want us? There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's -- Answer the question! Where do you send them? You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us. Where do we go?! Where do we go from here??!! We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding? Where do you think we came from? How do you think we got here??!! We're hungry do you have anything to eat? All right -- what are you? I don't care... Just get it over with. Just the face. Your own work? Thanks. I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red. I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that... It has nothing to do with you. I'm fine... See you... Anybody we know? Did you? Did you ever see anybody renew? No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him. I just might look in on New You 483 myself. That was a great shot you made. Who invited you? Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother. You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him -- What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than -- come on, Sandman. Well... you can't have them all. Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. Did you ever see Francis-8? No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape. But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one." Just wondered... what happens? Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are? Even the alarm didn't wake him. Open your eyes once, idiot. It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him! Turn this way. No, no... not you... YOU! Of course. I don't know where... I just took them for granted. It's our only chance. It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow. Beloved wife... Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either... Yes. You and I, Jessica. Jessica... listen to me... listen to me... The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand? Things change! Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?! I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and -- We can't. We're going back. What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him? No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope. You want there to be one... that doesn't... One in a million, I suppose That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist? It could be... They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are? I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old. Of course. You know, Jessica. The Lifeclocks have no power outside. You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it. How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back. It all seemed to make sense until Box. I won't. I doubt it. Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these. Sooner or later, we'll have to try something. We'll be all right... We will... It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving. I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit. I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now. I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed. You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? Why did you stay with me? It doesn't make any difference anymore. It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back. Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything... ...to eat, of course. It's the only way. Why, Jessica? You're still a green. How will they know we're coming? You think Sandmen will? There's no other way for me, I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis. Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others. You know there's only one place to go now... Because he's my friend -- and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone. Are you taking me to them? Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them. All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner. Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there? The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us -- -- too fast Just follow -- no matter how it seems... Let's see -- how long has it been? When did you begin to question Lastday? Uh-uh. Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be. Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman: We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral. They're like beasts. Wild. That's nice. Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here. A Runner... Cathedral. A woman. If you trusted me, you'd know. If you did know, you'd tell me. Maybe you'll think of something... That's tomorrow. Are you here to help me? And I never heard of Sanctuary. I don't have much time. Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please... I let him go... believe me. A Runner gave it to me. It's different now. Help me. Both... running's what I'm interested in. You know something. I'm going to run. All right. You know. Of course. Maybe... sure... I couldn't get you out of my mind. But I wasn't sure you'd come. You're sure you don't want to try? What Quad do you live in? You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them. Want to try? Are you a 5 or a 6? But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in. So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal. You shouldn't even think such things... And you picked a strange person to say them to -- I'm not armed. Well? I'm listening. Let's have sex. I thought you were curious. About what? And now? And? But you put yourself on the circuit! Later. You're beautiful. Let's have sex. You felt sad. What's your name? I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners. Who brought you? Killed? Why do you use that word? Yes... probably he was renewed? Sad? What made you sad? Well then...? You prefer women? Please... no? You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular. Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you. What's wrong, Available? No -- Look, I'm in a hurry. It's all right with me. Is he here? A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor? Hello. Can you make it back? I'm sorry. I know... We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it. Stay? They lived together all their years? Thank you. Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"... I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light. More... many more. To a city with thousands and thousands of people. We're leaving. Not yet. May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest. Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place? What's beyond this place -- do you know? I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you. No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible. Where are they? Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father? What makes you think so? Have any other people ever passed through? Are there any other humans? How did you get here? What kind of place is this? How long have you been living here? No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica. Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...? I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone. Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.No -- just there -- on the first level. Don't look for us. We'll see you. Too little? Too little. Okay, wait for me. Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think? Well? How do you like it?Oh, my... Where are you going? Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise... I'll make the arrangements. They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living... We'll have to bury him. I don't know... but it does. All this. All of it. "Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity." You're both full of secrets like Macavity. Did you steal this? What kind of jewel is this? Mother and Father said so... you know? Yes... Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three. "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES." An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is? Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too. Oh my... I'll try. Yes... Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people. Oh, yes... I think... My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together. That's better than gold when it's cold. Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon? And all alive you say? Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats? Alive? What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me. All right. Are you ready to put him in? Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people. Never, never, ever. Nothing. No, no, no It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat. "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise." They're beautiful. May I have one too please? Dead... they're dead... and buried. My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know? But there may be a few around somewhere. Gracious... no. I have always been here... Just a place, I suppose... who knows? For as long as I can remember.My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck? I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else. We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here. Do you want to see Doc? Hello, Sandman.Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock. It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end. Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7. Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
