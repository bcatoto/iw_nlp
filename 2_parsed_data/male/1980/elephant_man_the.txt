A wicked birth... Ladies and Gentlemen, his lungs are  larger than this mammoth blacksmith's  bellows. So great is his power of  exhalation, rivaling even that of  the Great North Wind, that he will  now challenge two grown men to attempt  to hold the bellows shut as he applies  the mighty blast of his herculean  breath! Are there any volunteers? Ah! I see two likely lads! Come  forward! Come forward! Pit your  strength against the Mighty Wind- Man! Gentlemen... Are you ready? Yes we are... Right... etc. Ladies and Gentlemen!... Let the  demonstration begin!! Ladies and Gentlemen!... "THE Make way! Make way! I refuse to believe it! I will not  accept it! Those babies are simply  too ugly, they cannot be mine! I don't want them! Get rid of them!  I don't want to see them! We'll take these miserable whelps on  an outing, alright! We'll take them  to the zoo... WHERE THEY WILL STAY! Poppa! Poppa! Poppa, please! This is too much! They should not  allow it! They should not allow it! No! That's right out! Drop the  curtain! You can't do that! I've got my rights! I have the authority to close you  down, and I'm doing just that! This exhibit degrades all who see  it, as well as the poor creature  himself. He's a freak! How else can he live? Freaks are one thing. No one objects  to freaks, but this is entirely  different. This is monstrous, and  ought not to be allowed. These  officers will see to it that you are  on your way as soon as possible.  Good day. ...Movin' again! Have a care, guv'nor. Three quarters of an hour. What a mess. My father, sir. He's built quite a  successful practice. I hope to take  it over one day. Yes sir. Though of course I do have  a great desire to help my fellowman. Oh no, sir. (etc.) Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir. I found it. I say Freddie, what are you about? He's not a peeler... No, I don't think so. No... I don't think so. And who might you be, sir? I don't think so. No sir, we're  closed. Handsomely?... Who sent you? Never mind. I'm the owner. Here we are sir. Life is full of surprises. Ladies  and gentlemen, consider the fate of  this creature's poor mother. In the  fourth month of her maternal  condition, she was struck down by a  wild elephant Struck down, if you take my meaning,  on an uncharted African isle. The  result is plain to see ladies and  gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT Stand up! Stand up! Turn around! Turn around! Turn around! Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there. Now we got a deal... We understand  each other... guv. We understand  each other completely. Don't just stand there. Help him up. Not at all, sir. My... pleasure. You heard the doctor... Go on. Freddie, what you doing for... I say  do open a window in here or... Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry, I had no  idea that... I say! Good Lord, Freddie! What have you  got in there? Certainly, if you insist. You must  have quite a find there. Nothing of any importance, eh? You never mentioned his mental state. Quite a coup, Freddie. You'll look  splendid in the journal. Where ever did you find that creature? It's a pity. I pity the poor cab driver, myself. Belt up, you misbegotten garbage. How can I eat with that? How can I eat with THAT? Out of my sight! You clumsy sod! YOU! Bytes! DON'T... This won't do, my lad. This just  won't do! Our man is sick. Come right away. Like this. What did you do to him? He's been  like this all night! He was fine when he left here, and  now look at him. He fell. He falls. He's a clumsy git. Never watches  where he is going. That's the way he sleeps. If he lays  down, he'll die. Head's too heavy. Can't you fix him up here? ...He's  my livelihood. Listen. I really appreciate this, guv. You  know, there's lot of things that I  can do for you. I move in the proper  circles, for this type of thing... I like doing business with you. You  and I understand each other,  completely. I know I can trust you.  Can't I? Mr. Treves, come over here a moment,  won't you? Good morning, Treves. You've acquired a taste for this? Don't be mad. This muck can kill  you. Take this up, to to the man in the  isolation ward when you have a moment,  won't you? Indeed! A hospital is no place for secrecy,  Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded  figures about are liable to cause  comment. Why wasn't this patient  properly admitted, and why is he in  isolation? Is he contagious? Why isn't he in the General Ward,  then? Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to  assume that he is ultimately  incurable? What are your plans then, Treves...  You are aware that the London does  not accept incurables. The rules are  quite clear on that point. Oh, is he a friend of yours? I certainly sympathize with your  problem, Treves... Why don't you try  the British Home, or the Royal  Hospital for perhaps they would have  a place for him. The Elephant Man? Did you see him? What's wrong with him? What's all this, then? Mr. Treves is scrubbing his Elephant  Man. Elephant Man? Yeah... I hear it's a real horror.  Even made Mothershead scream. Friend of the night, eh? The Elephant  Man. I think I'll have me a look at  that. Now, you need the scrubbing, ducks! Hush, love, I told you before one  word from me, they'll toss you back  on the street, and then those pretty  little arms of yours will never grow  straight. Now close your eyes. Here he is, the old fiend of the  night, the terror of the London.  Let's have a look at you. Let's see  what makes 'em scream... Cor Blimey! So this is the Elephant Man. I ain't  never seen nothing like you before.  What the bleedin' hell happened to  you? Oh... dumb, eh? Good. I likes people what can keep  quiet. Like a drink? Go on... Go on have  some. No? You should try being more  sociable, mate. You and I are going to be good  friends, we are. And, I've got lots  of friends who I know would like to  meet you. And they will, mate...  they will. Welcome to the London. Here early again, eh Mr. Treves? If  you don't mind my saying so, sir,  with your early habits, you'd 'a  made a fine milkman. Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess. ...Yyes Yyess. Yes! Yes. Hello... My... name is... John... Merrick Merrick... Mmmerrick. Mmmerrick. Hello... my name is... John Merrick. Hello, my name is John Merrick. Ah, Treves... Have you contacted the British Home  and the Royal Hospital? Good! How is the patient? A few words? I thought he was  imbecile? I really don't think that's necessary  Treves. I'm quite sure the committee  will be able to make an equitable  decision on the merits of the case,  such as they are. No, Treves, it's out of the question.  Now if it was up to me, I'd say  "Certainly, let's meet the fellow,  by all means," I'm sorry, I simply  can't speak for the other members of  the committee. Mr. Treves, it's out of the question.  I want to hear as soon as possible  what the other hospitals can do. I'm  sorry. I want my man back. Never mind that, I want my man! DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've  had plenty of time to fix him up,  and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do  you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves.  We had a bargain! Pull the other one, why don't you!  We made a deal! He's a freak! That's how they live.  We're partners, him and I, business  partners. You're willfully deprivin'  me of my livlihood! You think you're better 'n me? YOU  wanted the freak to show all your  doctor chums and make a name for  yourself, you guv. So I gave him to  you. On trust, in the name of science!  And now I want him back. I want him back! I've got my rights, damn you, and  I'm going to the authorities! Well, go to the authorities... By all means do so. In fact, I'll  fetch them myself. I'm quite sure  they'd be very interested in your  story, as well as ours. Right... Right. Singularly unpleasant chap... uh...  I don't suppose there would be any  harm in my meeting your... patient,  Mr. Treves. Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow  afternoon? Two o'clock then... you know Treves...  It seems this acquaintance of yours  has become rather more than just an  acquaintance. Elephant Man? I don't want to meet  an Elephant Man. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not  want, he maketh me to lie down in  green pastures; He leadeth me beside  still waters. He restoreth my soul:  He Guideth me in the paths of  righteousness... Righteousness for his namesake. Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am  very pleased to meet you! Speaking is one thing, Treves, but  can the man comprehend? He needn't. I have no desire to cause  him any discomfort. Did you make  those inquiries we spoke about? Fine, fine. You know, your dedication  to this patient is an inspiring thing,  Treves. But you must remember that  this is a hospital, and there are  many patients here. Patients who can  be made well, and you owe them your  first consideration. Just don't become  so obsessed, old man, that you begin  to neglect them. Come in. Hello... my name is John Merrick. I  am very pleased to meet you. I'm very... pleased to meet you. How are you feeling today? I feel much better. Thank you for  asking. And you? I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How  is your bronchitis? I feel much better. Thank you. Are you comfortable here? Everyone has been very kind. I am  extremely grateful. Oh yes! It is much better than what  I am used to. Oh yes? Potatoes... But the variety of food here is very  pleasing... I commend you. I understand that you were beaten? Oh no, everyone has been very kind. No, I meant in your former situation. I'm feeling much better now... Tell me, how do you like Mr. Treves? As a teacher? ...I... everyone has been very kind  to me. Of course. How long did you and Mr.  Treves prepare for this interview? ...everyone has been very kind. Yes, of course... Well, it's been a  pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick.  Good day. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not  want. He maketh me to lie down in  green pastures... It was a nice try, Treves, but the  man is so obviously mouthing your  words. I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't  belong here. He's be much happier  somewhere else, where he could be  constantly looked after. Believe me,  Frederick, it's better that it worked  out this way. Good day. Yea, though I walk through the valley  of the shadow of death, I will fear  no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy  rod and Thy staff, they comfort me... What is it, Treves? Thou preparest a table before me in  the presence of mine enemies, Thou  anointest my head with oil... My cup runneth over. Surely goodness  and loving kindness shall follow me  all the days of my life, and I shall  dwell in the house of the Lord  forever. I don't understand. I... I used to read the Bible every  day. I know it very well. The Bible,  and the Book of Common Prayer. The  23rd Psalm is very beautiful. It was a great pleasure to meet you,  Mr. Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you. I hope we can talk together again  sometime. Good day. I want to see you in my office as  soon as you're through up here. We've  a good deal to discuss. Treves. Well done. You did not ask me. Oh, no do not say that. You have  been so kind to me. I was afraid to  say too much. People always want me  to be quiet. You wanted me to speak,  but I was afraid. Forgive me. Can you imagine what his life has  been like? No you can't. You can't begin to  know, no one can. You are quite right, Treves, this is  an exceptional case. And I quite  agree that the committee should see  Mr. Merrick. No, not that way. Broadneck and the  others don't like to deal with  patients directly. It makes them  queasy... Do you have any photographs  of Mr. Merrick? Excellent. We shall present them,  along with the other particulars of  the case to the committee. I want  them to see, exactly, how horribly  his body has been affected. You and  I shall vouch for his inner qualities. Of course they will. They're  reasonable men. Thou heardest my voice; hide not  thine ear at my breathing, At my  cry. I hear you have some trouble  sleepin'... Head's too heavy, eh? And I heard a nasty rumor about you;  I heard you can talk but you can't,  can you... can you... can you?... Noooo! No... No you can't! One word about  me out of that stinking cakehole...  Just ONE word, and you'll have no  trouble at sleepin'... no trouble at  all. You understand me? Do you!! Yyyesss. There now, that's better, i'n' it? As far as I can see, the only obstacle  might be Broadneck. He has enormous  influence over the others, very old  school, not an easy man to impress.  In any case, if worse does come to  worse, we still have the British and  Royal Homes to fall back on, don't  we. Don't we? Well, it's up to us then, isn't it? Don't worry Treves, we'll make them  see it our way. They've eyes, haven't they? I, for one, am sick and tired of  this competitive freak-hunting by  these overly ambitious young doctors,  trying to make names for themselves.  To parade then about in front of the  pathological society is one thing,  but to waste this committee's valuable  time with requests for shelter for  these abominations of nature is quite  another. Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion.  There are two small rooms off Bedstead  Square that are no longer in use and  would be admirably suited to Mr.  Merrick's needs. I also propose to  write a letter to The Times, appealing  to their readers for assistance.  Knowing the generosity of the British  public, I feel we would have little  trouble in raising the funds for his  maintenance. Indeed, this hospital's  rules do preclude the admission of  incurables, but if ever there was an  exception to the rule, it is this  patient. So therefore, I propose, if  Mr. Treves is finished, that we put  it to a vote. All those in favor of  keeping Mr. Merrick here? One moment, as far as I'm concerned this creature  has no business being in our hospital.  I think Mr. Carr Gomm's letter would  be an excellent idea, and when you appeal for funds, I  think you should appeal for a more  appropriate place for him as well. I  agree the British public is generous,  and I'm sure that somewhere the  creature will find a happy and  permanent home, but not here. I see. All, then, that move we keep  Mr. Merrick here? All those opposed? I see. Well then. In the meantime, of course,  he needn't be turned out. He may  stay in the rooms off Bedstead Square  until such time as more suitable  arrangements can be made, thus freeing  the Isolation Ward for more deserving  patients. Well then, Mr. Chairman,  if there is nothing further to  discuss, I move that we adjourn this  meeting and all go bout our normal  business. I second the motion gentlemen. This  meeting is adjourned. Somehow I don't think they quite  understand. "...in life until he came under the  kind care of the nursing staff of  the London Hospital and the surgeon  who has befriended him..." Good publicity for the Hospital, at  any rate. Treves comes off well too, eh Freddie? It was pleasant of you to join us  this evening, Frederick. Your Elephant Man dining out this  evening? I understand the kitchen ran out of  hay this morning. Do continue reading, Mr. Stanley,  please. "...it is a case of singular  affliction brought about through no  fault of himself; he can but hope  for quiet and privacy during a life  which Mr. Treves assures me is not  likely to be long," The Elephant Man. Makes you sound  rather more like a zoo-keeper than a  surgeon, Frederick. I say, what's he on about? He's getting a bit of a swelled head,  if you ask me. Well, no one did ask you Atkins. Frederick Treves is not only the  most skillful surgical operator here,  he's also a humanitarian of the  highest order. You sound like a pack  of whining school boys with your  petty jealousies. Look here, Fox, I simply said. Oh belt up! "A silent shaft of stone on a deserted  promontory, the lonely Eddystone is  a beacon of aid and comfort to  mariners of all nations." Good evening. Very well, thank you.  And you? Thank you... so much... oh it's  beautiful! Good night. Here... listen to this. This is a  letter to THE London Times from the  guvnor of the hospital. There is now in a little room off  one of our attic wards a man named  John Merrick, so dreadful a sight  that he is unable even to come out  by daylight to the garden. He has  been called The Elephant Man on  account of his terrible deformity... ...His appearance is so terrible  that woman and nervous persons fly  in terror at the sight of him. ...and guess who can get you tickets  to see him? Your own Sunny Jim! Let's go see him, then! Keep your shirts on. ...When the time is right. Right now  he's in the attic but tomorrow they're  movin' him into Bedstead Square,  right into my lap... then... for the  right price you'll see something  you'll never see again in your life. Workhouse! This... is my new home? The hospital? How long will I stay here? When I'm next moved may I go to a  lighthouse?... or to a blind-asylum? Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd  expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things  undoubtedly take time. Well... I'll let you know if there's  something in the afternoon post. Yes. Thank you very much. No, nothing. Thank you very much. I'm very... I'm not used to such kindness. From  a beautiful woman. Yes... thank you. Yes please, two. Two, please. Oh yes. You have so many nice things,  and so much room. Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do  you call that thing above the bed? Ohhh... It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit  with you very much. It's so very  kind of you to have me as a guest in  your home. I'm sorry I made a  spectacle of myself. I love the way you've arranged your  pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that  the way it's done in most houses? Who are they of? The children! May I see? The Children. Where are your children Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice. How lovely. They have noble faces. Oh, yes. Would you... would you like to see  my mother? Here. She has the face of an angel... She  was an angel. She was so kind... so  kind to me. It's not her fault, for  in the fourth month of her maternal  condition she was knocked down by an  elephant. I'm sure I must have been  a great disappointment to her. If only I could find her. If only  she could see me now, here, with  such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs.  Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then  maybe she would love me as I am.  I've tried to hard to be good. Please... please... Good morning. Yes. Thank you... very much. I meant no harm, it was the only  place where I could find cardboard.  I thought it has been thrown away. The main spire. ...I learned a long time ago. I'll have to find some more. Come in. Good morning. Good day, Mr. Merrick. Good day...! I've brought you some things. I hope  you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you  don't think it too forward. Oh, no. I knew you'd understand. Here. I want you to know that I don't go  about giving my pictures to just  anyone. Oh, no. I would never think it! It's  so beautiful. You are so... I'll  give it a place of honor, here, next  to my mother. She's very pretty, your mother. Yes. Mr. Treves says that you are in the  theatre. Do you live there? Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there. Well, even to work there would be  wonderful. Is it beautiful? You've never been? Alas, no. Well you must go. It is one of the  most beautiful places on earth. Of  course, I'm rather partial. Tell me about it, please! It's very difficult to put into a  nutshell, but I should say the theater  is the shrine of the imagination,  where one may suspend disbelief and  travel anywhere in the world, to any  time you desire. You may look over  the shoulders of kings, unobserved,  battle with ruthless tyrants, and  marry the beautiful princess, all in  the space of a few hours. Onstage  you may be whoever you wish to be,  do anything you please, and always,  always live happily ever after. The  theatre is all the brightest and  best things of the world, Mr. Merrick.  It is lights and music, gaiety and  joy. It's... well, it's romance. Romance! That's one thing the theatre has in  great store. which reminds me. I  have something else for you... Have you read it? No, but I certainly shall. Romeo and Juliet. I know of this...  "If I profane with my unworthiest  hand, This holy shrine, the gentle  fine is this: My lips, two blushing  pilgrims, ready stand, To smooth  that rough touch with a tender kiss." Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand  too much, Which mannerly devotion  shows in this; For saints have hands  that pilgrims hands do touch, And  palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers  too? Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use  in prayer. O, then, dear saint, let lips do  what hands do. They pray, grant thou,  lest faith turn to despair. Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an  Elephant Man at all... Oh no? Oh no... no... you're a Romeo. So, there you are, my boy, my  treasure. Well mum, that looks like Alexander,  Lord Waddington's driver. Thank you for your kind gifts. I  can't say enough about this ring.  And this walking stick is ever so  dashing. So much more elegant than  my old one. More tea? If you have a chill I can close the  window. Oh no, no, no, I'm fine. Please... I  mean, thank you. I don't get out as often as I'd like  to, for some people DO find my  appearance disturbing. Of course, I  can't fault them. People are often frightened by what  they don't understand. And it is hard to understand, even  for myself, for you see, Mother was  so very beautiful. How's your tea? When will the stream be aweary of  flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of  blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of  fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of  beating, and nature die? Mr. Treves, there is something I've  been meaning to ask you for some  time... ...Can you cure me? I thought as much. Come in. Yes, soon I will start the main spire,  but I must finish these columns first,  How kind of her! Oh no! There is nothing! I have  everything, you have given me  everything I could possibly want. I  am happy every hour of the day. I  only wish there was something I could  give to you. You don't think it's too gaudy, do  you? Night! Ahh! Broadneck! You'll no doubt be  pleased to know that we've received  a smashing response to my letter.  It's all very heartwarming, though  several letters do mention how beastly  it would be to part the poor fellow  from Mr. Treves and the staff, but  since the committee insists... Good day, Carr Gomm. I'm afraid so, Mrs. Mothershead.  Perhaps tomorrow. Steady on, Treves. Have a seat. Gentlemen, I know we begin every  meeting by reading the minutes, but  in the interest of speed I think we  should conclude a matter discussed  previously, to wit, that of Mr. John  Merrick, the Elephant Man... Mr. Broadneck? Mr. Chairman! I was under the distinct  impression that we had concluded  discussion of this disagreeable  matter. Had we not ascertained that  an Elephant Man is not acceptable as  a patient? Have we not, very  generously, allowed the creature to  use two of our rooms until such time  as he could be properly disposed of?  Have we not... I must be more careful! Which brings to mind my next point.  The rules, gentlemen, the rules. In  a society such as ours, it is of  paramount importance that we not  stray from the established order.  Has that order not already been  fearfully strained by allowing this...  this... sideshow exhibit to take up  residence, however temporary, in two  very useful rooms, the purpose of  which would be far better served in  accommodating treatable patients,  patients to whom this hospital was  originally dedicated? I believe we  have a duty... ...Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home...  it's cloudy out, I know, but remember;  behind the clouds there is always  the sun. ...In light of these facts, our course  is clear. The question is not whether  to accept this creature as a patient,  the question is when will those rooms  be vacated for use by better  qualified, more deserving cases? I  move that this Elephant Man be removed  from the premises immediately. We  have a sacred duty to cure the sick,  not care for circus animals. That is  my last word on the subject. Mr.  Chairman, shall we vote? I take it, Mr. Broadneck, that your  mind is fixed on this matter? Mr. Chairman! Don't you have ears? I  am unalterably opposed to any... ...No, my mind is made up on this,  and I am resolved to stand firm. You  shall not sway me. May we now vote,  Mr. Chairman, at long last? Yes, I believe that time has come. Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness  Alexandra, Princess of Wales. Indeed not, your Highness. Your  presence is always greatly  appreciated. We were just about to  put the matter of Mr. Merrick to a  vote. The Princess is very interested in  Mr. Merrick's fate. Thank you very much, your Highness,  you may be sure we shall. Well then, I move that Mr. John  Merrick be admitted to the London  Hospital on a permanent basis, on  condition that the Hospital shall  receive a yearly payment equal to  the cost of occupying one bed, and  that the funds for his care shall be  clearly separate from hospital funds.  All those in favor. The motion is carried. Well, now we may go about our normal  business. Please, come in. Mr. Merrick, it is my great pleasure  to welcome you, officially to The  London Hospital. The Governing  Committee this morning voted  unanimously to provide you these  rooms on a permanent basis. This is  your home now. I'm so very, very  pleased for you. ...my... home? You did this for me? Please... please thank the governing  committee for me. I will do my utmost  to merit their kindness. My home. Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends. Here now, these lovely ladies ain't  never seen it! You're on mate. Alright, alright, that's enough for  this performance. Hang on, hang on, there's always  tomorrow night. Not to worry. Room for one more? At the right price... There's room. Well, let's be off then. Quietly now! Quietly! We don't want  to scare him. Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am  very, VERY pleased to meet you! Curtain time!!! No, no! You look lovely. Don't change  a thing, darling. You look like the  bleedin' Prince of Wales. My friends... The Elephant Man! Horrible... I told you it was  horrible... just horrible. Perhaps the ladies would like a closer  look? 'Cor, he's a real ladies' man, come  on... give the ladies' man a kiss. Come on, you'll give him a kiss. Here that's enough romance. Now into  bed. A prince needs a harem! Mind his head... You'll kill him. Quiet down. Quiet down. You'll have  the whole place down on us. Bring him out then, so's we all can  see him. Everyone outside!!! Give 'im a drink. Here now... Here now... He's had  enough... show's over! Meet you at the Peacock. Bring your friend. He's had 'is fill for one night. I did real well tonight. Here... buy yourself a sweet. My treasure... Aren't you glad to see me? Bytes! Get into your cloak... ...now, your hood... do it! ...Alright. Let's go. Mr. Treves? I... I don't know what you mean,  Sir. Take him? Now wait... I didn't take  him anywhere. We were just having  some fun. We didn't hurt him... just  having a laugh, that's all. When I left him, he was in his bed,  safe and sound. YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't  done nothing wrong. People pay to  see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just  take the money. Have a care, Mr. Treves. I ain't  afraid of you! You and your bleedin'  Elephant Man! I'm glad what I did!  And you can't do nothing! Only  Mothershead can sack me. I'd like to think I felt no less for  John than you, Treves, but face the  facts, the man has disappeared, very  likely to the continent. There's no  question of your going after him,  you're desperately needed here by  your patients. Remember Treves, you  did everything in your power...  everything in your power. Still haven't eaten, eh? Bytes... please! Eat, my treasure, I want you healthy. I'm beginning to feel your weight. ...The result is plain to see. Ladies  and Gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT Turn around! Dance! Dance! Eat, my treasure. Eat. I said eat! Eat, damn you. EAT! EAT! I said EAT!! The result is plain to see. Ladies  and gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT Turn around! Dance! Up! Up! Give the call of the elephant! Louder! Get up you miserable bastard! I SAID, GET UP! I'm beatin' a dead horse. Another bleedin' heart! You sly bastard. You're doing this  to spite me, aren't you! Aw, Bytes, he's sick. He's doing it to spite me, I tell  you, and it's got to stop! He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die. If he does it's his own fault! But  I'm not burying that swollen bag of  flesh. What are you going to do? I'll show you! I'll show you! Don't! Shut up! Bytes, please... Out! Bytes! Bytes, please!! NO! I AM NOT AN ELEPHANT! I AM NOT You alright? y-y-yes-- Want to come out? You're English. Of course! You want out? Yes. Won't be a moment. We've decided... You've got to get  away from here... Here... you'll need these. Good of you, mate. Good luck. But... but... I'll be alright. Thank you, my friends. I'll go in with you, you'll need a  ticket. I'm just going to help my friend on  board. This'll do. I'm sorry I could only get you a  third class ticket, but it's all we  had. Oh no, my friend... Say hello to London for me. I miss  her. Oh, yes. You know, I saw you once there, in  London. You're a great attraction. Luck, my friend, luck. Who needs it  more than we? I'm sorry, you'll have to leave now. This is the end of the line, you'll  have to leave now. Wait! One more! You'll have to hurr... Finally! Dover! Mummy! Mummy! Look at that man! His  head, it's huge! Mummy, why is his  head so big? Mummy? Mummy? Mister! Mister! I am not an animal... I'm not... I'm  not... I am a man. Are you Frederick Treves, sir? You know this man, sir? Mr. Treves! Treves. It's all arranged. I'll send over  some evening gowns for the sisters  that you select to accompany Mr.  Merrick. You'll be using the Royal  entrance and Princess Alexandra  herself will be there to welcome him  to her private box. Well it is a miracle he ever got  back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves,  under your expert care, he'll have  many happy years ahead. How awful for John. Is he... dying then? Well, it's all quite... I've never  heard... It's quite... You women are such strange and  wonderful creatures... Alas, it seems  to be my fate to fall in love with  each and everyone of you. I especially  wish you could all be with me  tonight... I'm finally going to the  theatre. ...The theatre... O for a Muse of fire, that would  ascend  The brightest heaven of invention, A  kingdom for a stage, princes to act  And monarchs to behold the swelling  scene! Then should the warlike Harry,  like himself,  Assume the port of Mars; and at his  heels,  Leash'd in like hounds, should famine,  sword and fire  Crouch for employment. But pardon,  gentles all,  The flat unraised spirits that have  dar'd  On this unworthy scaffold to bring  forth  So great an object: can this cockpit  hold  The vasty fields of Rance? Or may we  cram  Within this wooden O the very casques  That did affright the air at  Agincourt?  O, pardon! since a crooked figure  may  Attest in little place a million;  And let us, ciphers to this great  account,  On your imaginary forces work. Fair Katharine, and most fair, will  you vouchsafe to teach a soldier  terms  Such as will enter at a lady's ear  And plead his love-suit to her gentle  heart? O fair Katharine, if you will love  me soundly with your French heart, I  will be glad to hear you confess it  brokenly with your English tongue.  Do you like me, Kate? An angel is like you, Kate, and you  are like an angel. What say you, fair one? That the  tongues of men are full of deceits? I know no way to mince it in love,  but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker is but a prater; a  rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg  will fall; a straight back will stoop;  a black beard will turn white; a  curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair  face will wither; a full eye will  wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate,  is the sun and the moon, or rather  the sun and not the moon; for it  shines bright and never changes, but  keeps his course truly. Thus far, with rough and allunable  pen,  Our bending author hath pursued the  story,  In little room confining mighty men,  Mangling by starts the full course  of their glory.  Small time, but in that small most  greatly liv'd  This star of England: Fortune made  his sword;  By which the world's best garden he  achiev'd. Oh no, I couldn't. I feel as if I've traveled my whole  life just to stand here. Wasn't Mrs. Kendal wonderful? I can't  blame the King for wanting to marry  her. Yes, very soon. Oh yes! It was wonderful! Mr. Treves? Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly.  Is it alright, did I make any mistakes  that you can see? Then I shouldn't change anything? ...I'll walk you to the door. You too, my friend. Goodnight. It is finished. John... Merrick! When will the stream be aweary of  flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of  blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of  fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of  beating.... ...and nature die? Never, oh! Never, nothing will die;  the stream flows, the wind blows,  the cloud fleets, the heart beats... Nothing will die.
