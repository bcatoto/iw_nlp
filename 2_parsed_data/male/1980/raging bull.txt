I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in. They wanna talk to you. We're from... Let's go, Jake, wake up!Ok, champ. Just come by to wish you luck. Need anything? You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok? Hey champ! Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head! He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him. Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment. What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast? Aside from everything else, your family all right? All right, you guys, shake hands. All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?What? I want to believe you, LaMotta. Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank. You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog. I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.For what? About what? I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place. Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up? No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy. I'm Ok. Tommy, thanks for coming over. You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here... 'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody. I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money? Believe what you want. I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter. What who's been sayin'? What's up, Colonel? And where you goin'? What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business. No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch. It looks done. I'll take it the way it is. This looks done. Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around? Yeah, I really cleaned up on him. You're a good sport, lady. J.R., glad you could make it. Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it? You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie? Did you ever fuck my wife? I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met. Did you ever fuck my wife? Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody. But you said "you." What do you mean, "you"? What do you mean, "you"? You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody... When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'. Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth. Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time. You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'... Did Salvy fuck Vickie? Well, I heard some things. Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie? Didn't it have nothin' to do with me? Why didn't you tell me about it? You know, when you gave him a beatin'. Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town? How's that? Well, that's what I mean. Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth. Where you been? What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat! I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in. Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know... Yeah, except fall down. That's right. What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything. C'mon, Joey. Yeah, I know. What did Tommy say? I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand? When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth. What do you mean? I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her... Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here. Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her. Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass. Say what you're gonna say. Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager! I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place. No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go. I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno... Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand. I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title. Do you see her yet? How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough. Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife. I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know. Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now. You know, like bang her or anything? You wasn't with her? You wasn't with her, were you? Yeah, she's nice. What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one... She ever go with them? Like Salvy? 'Cause I wanna catch her alone. Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right... How do you know? You know her that good? Go 'head. Yeah -- Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you? Who's that? Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again. And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot. Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood. Answer me when I talk to you. See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody. Go ahead. Harder. Take the towel off. Here's your glove. Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw. You heard me, I said hit me. Hit me in the face. Yeah. Do me a favor. I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know... I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter. Nothing... Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me. Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie. It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight. I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight. I tell you what. You hit me here. Sugar Ray hits me here. I can't tell the difference. I just fight. You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight... Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now. Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about. I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad. He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down. Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title. Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice. How many pounds I gotta lose? At night? What time is it? Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it? What friends? Don't make no difference no more. Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ. I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped. I promise I just gotta pick up one thing. No. Open the door. Vickie, open up. I need to come in. Aw, c'mon, Vick -- Aw, c'mon. Don't say that. Open the door, Vickie. Sure, what else is new? I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club. Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number. I dunno. I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here. Then what? What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say? OK. Talk. What? I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out. Yeah -- You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you. Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch! You did? You're a fuckin' liar. Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy? Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt! Who've you been fuckin'? With Salvy, eh? Do I have to kill you, eh? Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer? I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it. What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here. Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night? Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away? What was it about? What'd you see? What'd you see? I called. You weren't there. Where you been all day? What's that kissing on the mouth shit? Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help. Don't ever do that again. You don't do it! You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight. You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do. Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that. You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want. You sure you're not thinking of him right now? That he's got a pretty face. Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro? Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you? Huh? You asleep? Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep? Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him? In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right? You're not interested in him? Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him? What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him? Who asked you? Who asked you? Who asked you? What do you mean, "good looking?" Now, touch me... ...here. Now take your panties off. Go 'head. Do it. Now take the rest off. Do what I say. Take off my pants. Come here. If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here. Come over here. It's OK. That's all right. He don't mind. No. Can you see it? Just give it a nice little tap. Just keep your eye on the ball. That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel? You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you. Oh no? I thought you was a movie star. I ain't ever talked to a movie star before. Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride? You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for? Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me? I'd tell you to bet a bundle. Yeah, the weight's Ok. He should. Never felt better. C'mon, Tommy -- Hi, Tommy. How are you?Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own. How can he embarrass you? Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that. Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy. Yeah, I understand, Tommy. Stop it. What're you, crazy? I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy. Whatsa matter with you? Whadda ya mean? What? You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month. So what? I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head. What? So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about. Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now. What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me? Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like. I did keep an eye... What? Whatever you touched, that's good now. Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it. No, I just told you what happened. It didn't have nothin' to do with you. Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about. When? I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way. Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth. What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law? Screw you, Jack. So eat just a little. You gotta eat something. I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak. We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die. All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait. Except fall down like a normal person. See? That's all there was to it. G'wan, do it. Protect yourself, rummy. Stick out your hands, Jake. I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is... Sure, I'll keep an eye on her. Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you. Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter. Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to. Whatcha doin'? Excuse me for a minute. Be right back. C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you. Nah, she would never... This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right? You want the title shot or not? You want the title shot? Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat? You want us to wait for you? You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong. They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why. He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight... Give me a chance. Let me look. No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take. C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight. I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything. Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what? With her? How? Huh? Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you. Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him. Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old. How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something. I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that. You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass. Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here. No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her? Whadda you care? I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como... What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here... Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I... What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove? Jack! Enough! Jack, I got no gloves. C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks. You want me to do what? Sure. What is it? You know? That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy. What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight. Hey, c'mon, what's the matter? What's wrong? I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you. What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife. Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law. I said, let's go. Right, the gym. All right, I'll try. See you later. I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody. Hey, leave the kids alone. What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother. Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there, take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash. And you're drinking with them right now. Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long. I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want. It don't look right. No, you're his wife. What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta? You sound bitter. Does that mean... You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time? Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate. Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young? Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand. Excuse me for living. Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink? Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget. Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody! Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that. Get lost. Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat." He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that? Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me? How's the weight? Ok? This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid. Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh? How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good? Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you. Jake, sit down for a minute.Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points. I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break. Three more, I figure. Yeah. At night. Nine o'clock. It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out. Don't fight anymore! It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
