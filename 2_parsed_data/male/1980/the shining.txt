Yes, Dad. Yes, Dad. No, Dad. You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you? Dad? I guess so. Do you like this hotel? Dad? Then why don't you go to sleep? Do you feel bad? I am, Dad. Dad? Yes, Dad. Okay. Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine? You mean they ate each other up? What was the Donner party? I'm hungry. Dad? Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237? You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha? What about Room 237? Is there something bad here? Maybe he showed me something. I don't know. Yes. It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything. Yes. Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth. Tony. I'm not supposed to. Chocolate. Yeah. French Fries and Ketchup. No. Mommy! Mommy... Mommy...! Mommy... Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Okay, Mom. I won't, Mom. I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe. I won't make any noise. Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine? Mom? No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay...oh! All right. Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry, Mom. I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V. Okay, Mom. Okay. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here. Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter? Do I have to? To my stomach. Because he hides. No. No. It's the little boy that lives in my mouth. Talking to Tony. Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.' Yes. No.Yes, I'd like you to. Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day. Okay? Does Tony ever tell you to do things? Where does he go? Why not? if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony? Oh, Is Tony one of your animals? Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth? What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth? Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth? Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange? How did he manage to do that? What sort of injury did he have? Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here? Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...? Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance? Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained. They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again. Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about. I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny. Thank you. Yes.You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance? I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance. I fear that is the only thing to do. Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you. Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance. It's Grady, Mr. Torrance. Delbert Grady. Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more. Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will. A nigger cook. A nigger. He is, Mr. Torrance. Oh, they're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir. Yes, sir. I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir. Why no, sir. I don't believe so. Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir. Why no, sir. I don't believe so. That's right, sir. Yes, sir. Won't keep you a moment, sir. That doesn't matter, sir. You're the important one. Yes sir. Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh... I'm afraid it's advocaat sir. It tends to stain.Nothing. There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out! You understand, stay out! No I ain't. Room 237? Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see. Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good. Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind. Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast. No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't. I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining. Try to think what it was. Now think real hard, Doc. Think. Do they know he tell you things? Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony? How does he tell you things? Is Tony the one that tells you things? Who's Tony? Who says you ain't supposed to? Why don't you want to talk about it? Chocolate it shall be. Come on son. Do you like ice cream, Doc? You don't? Well what's your favorite food then? Now this is where we keep all of out meat. You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers. You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb. Do you like lamb, Doc? Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel. Thank you very much. I'll do that. Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there, Hallo. My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel. No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just getting to the ice cream. It will be a pleasure. Right this way Mrs. Torrance. Oh, that's just great. How do you folks like our hotel so far? Sure. Good. Well I guess I probably heard you call him that. I did? Beg pardon? Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice. Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch. Yeah, this is it. How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you? Oh Wendy. That's nice. That's the prettiest. Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred. Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie? Glad to meet you, Winifred.Good. I love you, Danny. I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh? Are you sure? Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you? What do you mean? What? Good. I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever. Yes I do. I love it. Don't you? Yes? I can't. I have too much to do. No. I'm just a little tired. Yes. Good. I want you to have a good time. Are you having a good time? How's it going, Doc? Come here for a minute, first. They had to, in order to survive. There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times. They got snowbound one winter in the mountains. They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive. I think that was farther west in the Sierras. Well you should have eaten your breakfast. Yes? There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady. For the moment, Mr. Grady. Only for the moment. Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady. That's all I ask. No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here. Grady... oh. She eh... interferes. Well, he is a very willful boy. How? A nigger! Who? No. And, er... where are they now? Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here? haven't I seen you somewhere before? Delbert Grady. Grady? Fine. Awfully nice of you to say. Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree. Advocaat is it? Well, I'm looking for a change. I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet. Eh - formerly a school-teacher. Pleasure to meet you. Bill, how do you do? I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd. No charge? It's good to be back, Lloyd. Hi Lloyd. I've been away. Now I'm back. Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd. Thanks. Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better. Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter. That's swell. I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you. You were always the best of them. How's my credit in this joint anyway? Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet. I was afraid they were going to be there until next April. So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice. You can do that, can't you, Lloyd? You're not to busy, are you? Wendy... Wendy... Give me the bat. Give me the bat. Wendy... Give me the bat. Stop swinging the bat. Give me the bat. Give me the bat. Wendy give me the bat. Put the bat down, Wendy. Stop swinging the bat. I'm not going to hurt you. Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!' I'm going to bash them right the fuck in. Wendy! I'm not going to hurt you. Why? Why? Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers? Have you ever thought about my responsibilities? Of course you are. As soon as possible. When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor? You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor? I don't think that's true. I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are. You can't remember. How do you like it? Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up! Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you? You mean just leave the hotel? Get him out of here? I think he did it to himself. Good. Absolutely nothing. How is he? Yes, I did. No, nothing at all. Which room was it? I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny. I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had. It's the most horrible dream I ever had. Fine. Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm? or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in. Now do you think you can handle that? Fine. Now we're going to make a new rule. Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing, and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand? Wendy, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration. I'm not being grouchy. I just want to finish my work. What do you want me to do about it? I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere. Yeah... that's all it is. Lots of ideas. No good ones. Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first. Hmm, nice. I know it. Eleven thirty - Jesus! What time is it? Perfect for a child. Sure is. Uh...huh. Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through. I don't think I can get home before nine or ten. Hi, babe. Well, it's very... homely. I'd better collect my family first. Right there. No, my son's discovered the games room. No problem. In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat. Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict. Well, that is eh quite a story. I don't believe they did. I'm intrigued. They'll love it. Not for me. five months of peace is just what I want. Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... Well, that sounds fine to me. Only in a very general way. Do you mind if I ask why you do that? It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic. Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks. Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours. Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman. I'm Jack Torrance. Mr. Ullman?It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point. Your money's no good here. What'll it be, sir? It's good to see you. Good evening Mr. Torrance. Women! Can't live with 'em. Can't live without 'em! I hope it's nothing serious. How are things going, Mr. Torrance? Thank you for saying so. Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance. What'll it be?Good evening. Forest Service. All right, sir. I'd be glad to do that, sir. Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes? Good evening, Mr. Halloran. What can I do for you? Good evening. Forest Service.Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes? We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long. Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack. The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter. This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef. Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance. Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in. Oh... Oh fine. Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away. Oh... Has your luggage been brought in? Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen. Is your family having a look around? Good morning Jack. I hope you haven't been waiting too long. put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened. Well, obviously some people can be shut in together over long periods of time. The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are Well, my predecessor in this job I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970? been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job. Great... How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it? can of itself be a problem. That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation... Physically, it's not a very demanding job. The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation. ...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur. And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold. Well... Oh, it sure would be Let's see, where were we? Yes. I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May. Susie. JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee? Well, that's very good time, very good. Please sit down a minute. Have any trouble finding us? Very nice to meet you. Oh, well - come on in Jack. Yes? Yes. By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here. Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible. How're you getting on? Hi. Thank you, Susie. We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably. Oh...well this is our gold ballroom. As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel. This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter. All the best people. even before anybody knew what a jet set was. We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars. Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs. This is our Colorado Lounge. Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment. Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first. What time does the plane leave? Jack is a schoolteacher. Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter. I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through. Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.Well this ought to be quite a change for you. What line of work are you in now? Pleased to meet you. Fine. Eight thirty. Fine. How do you do?
