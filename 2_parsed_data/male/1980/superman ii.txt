She'll be fine. Hostages? Anybody been hurt? Jimmy, how's the - Everything on it? You do? I'll try to remember that . . . Lois, I really don't see why -- Take it easy. Take a deep breath. I like worrying about you. Lois, someday -- What else could I do? "They?" You're not selfish at all. I'm sorry. Sleep well? Hi. He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen. I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . . I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . . I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . . Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on. Blood . . . my . . . blood . . . Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside? Say you love me. Let's go to my place. Let's go to my place. I guess it would be all right if - Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all. Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening. We'd better talk. I didn't think I wanted to. You don't have anything to be sorry about. How could I . . . Oh come on, that's ridic - Lois, I . . . Lois, help! I can't -- I can't swim -- ! What?? How could you win a crazy bet like -- You've been under a lot of pressure lately - No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand -- Who ???? Whoever, I Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel. Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're -- Superman? Oh, was he here? I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean? No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed? Lois, you're amazing. I don't know, they look pretty happy to me... I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements. Sleeping arrangements. A "complimentary corsage." But this should be exposed. They get kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says. Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that. 'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents. It is kinda romantic. Really? Maybe I could try -- Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones? Actually, yes. I do? I don't? One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them. Uh. . . Lois, what are you doing? Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know. Lois, I usually do. No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous. Gee. But -- What?? Does Lois know about this yet? But . . ..that's terrible! Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to -- Uh...home...How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days. What's a curl? What'd he say before? He saw a girl?Are you okay? Tourists, about twenty of 'em. So far the hostages are unharmed. Yeah. I'll check. Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane? Maybe we just don' t know his game plan. A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.It's beautiful. Why didn't you go before we left? It has everything. It's beautiful. I'll be alright. It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius. Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway. Well done, Miss Teschmacher. That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves. Shhhhhhh! OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my black box is just about ready. Why? Where? DELETE IN CUTTING I want my Liberace record back tonight. Australia. Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . . Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice. Constantly. Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is. No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer. Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son of Jor-El. Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please. Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one. You'll miss the battle of the century! So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one. Under . . . the big one there. A good time! Is that all you care about?! Mush! Mush! North! A parka. You'll have to pack quickly. How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it. What else is ballast for? I didn't ask her anything . . . I asked the right question. No possibility for parole? Sensible enough. My kind of people. Now This I want to hear. Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this -- Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . . Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . . Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap! Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it. Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times -- Put down Lex Luthor? North. Keep going North! No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight. Cuba. Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . . Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . . You said it. Three-to-one should get you both ears and the tail.Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves. That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for? Oh! That black box in our cell? To ski? North. I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off. DELETE IN CUTTING Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got. The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it. Does she know about it? She's in it! That's why they call 'em terrorists. Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of -- Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?! Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio? Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been the last twelve hours? Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?! I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and now he decides to pull a disappearing act? He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen. You do, don't you, Kent? Give it another ten minutes. If we don't -- Hell, I'll tell him. Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns. Kent, I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.You'll find out, General! And when you do . . . I wish I knew. -- Oh, God. I'm the man they're protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory? I think he said a "curl." Artemis? Do you read me?Yes, but will you honor it? There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists? And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have. Um. . . .we have made this guarantee. In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.Yes. But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father -- you had each other. Can I never have what you had? Yes, but it's not all I feel. Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance? Oh no. I really like it sometimes. And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you. I never did this before . . . I have to tell you. Dinner. Oh yes. I'm sorry, I just never do much about that. But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois. So -- I hope you like it. Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home. Until now. You must be freezing. Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this -- Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole. Too late, Luthor. Too late . . . I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . . Luthor, you poisonous snake . . . I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . . Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.What do you want? We will bring him to his knees! He has powers as we do . . . He flies as well, then . . . Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer! The son of Jor-El on this Planet? We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have. Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance. Beginning with this one. Put down Lex Luthor ! Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way? What more? There is something more you want. The greed is written on your face. Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it? He ran in fear from us . . . Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod! Who is this . . . Superman? Zod. Zod. Who is this imbecile? Where is he? It will. Starting with your own. Did you really believe we would give up our advantage? We must combine our strength. Don't worry. I will draw his fire. With a few of my own. He... cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People . This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness. And so I was yesterday. And the day before. Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss. Stay. I will come to you. So this is the planet Houston . . . And I will lead. Then we must go there too. To rule. Finally - to rule! And then you shall have what you want. Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers! Free!
