That's why I'm letting you take care of this. I'm the one with appearances to maintain. But who gives a shit about you? Not even God. See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level. So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am. I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone. He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge. When you find the guy, you'll know. Same as last time -- the rest after. How'd you like to kill someone for me? How they goin', kid? Come over here. There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons. You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here. We'll find him. And where is this guest? Don't they want to interview him. Heavier than that now. But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story. What did you tell them. You should have let me do the talking. Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you. No, Terry. They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message. What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying." There's been some trouble downtown.Huh? Fuck you. You broke last time.No problem. If you don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen. I can take care of the paperwork. Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece. You're in gun country now, my friend. You came to the right place, sir. My wife's second cousin is English. Well, Scotch-Irish. Can I interest you in a holster? Oh really? Where you from? Close Quarters Combat. Keep one in my own home. Yes, sir. Won't find a better CQC on the market. That's a high-end item. Total reliability. Man knows what he likes.CQ what? What'd you call that -- the Protector? Lookin' good. What post office? Do you have any friends, man? I've been wondering something. You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will? What more do you want, man? Too easy? Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance. You steady on, man. What the fuck else did you do back there. You goin' back inside? Faith. No one else is even here yet. I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man. Valets . They park cars. He's having a party. Those aren't guards. They're valets. That was one of them? Has he? What? Huh? Who'd you butcher at the house? Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate. Oh, Jenny was in my acting class. No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress. Before she met him. But that's not where she met me. Not in my restaurant. He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work. That's not where they met. Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile. You believe that shit? Son of a bitch never smiled at me. Buried her at a "private" service. Private for who. Him? Five years, I think. Long time. Now what. You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that? Boom bam boom. You hadda show up on a weekend. This weekend. Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month. Not me, man. He don't have a concealed weapons permit. Probation? Man, you crazy. They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison. Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man? Do the background check? Go through a three-day waiting period? These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man. You're kiddin' me, right? But that's not me anymore. That's when I was into the gang lifestyle. That's not who I am now. Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man. I already told you, man. Corcoran. Know what that is? State prison. Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what you think. She didn't know what to say. I thought someone should say something. To someone. With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason. I felt like I owed her. You should talk to Elaine. That was her best friend. Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball. Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ... Those curves don't kid around. What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to the cops? Valentine wasn't even there. If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say. But I'll tell you something. She stood in front of these dudes, man. Eyeballing them . Checking them out. I felt like she was covering my ass that day. Bad place, man. Bad people. Some guys loading some trucks. Some kinda deal goin' down. I don't know and I don't care. Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos. That's what I thought, man. But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else. I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man. What d'you want from me. You kiddin', man? I don't need a wife and screamin' kids. I still got my youth. I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face. I did my time, okay? My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years. Boomerang. I dunno ... Maybe they do. Coulda happened to anyone, man. I never knew her to be reckless. I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks. But that's it, nothing more than that. I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside. There was no moon that night ... I dunno. What's he gonna say? They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset? I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles. She had her life, I had mine. Terry Valentine. I never said nothin' about nothin' like that. No, no, no. That's not what I wrote to you. Huh? I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family. I mean, what has it been -- six months? I didn't expect anyone. Eduardo. Rama. I thought maybe you just came for the ride. ... Reminds me of Jennifer. Hey, Elaine. You even know what he's saying half the time? Hell, no. I started writing. Not no more, they ain't. I quit that acting shit, man. Didn't get it. I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro. Got three callbacks. Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing? Same. What d'you say, Elaine?He had urgent business in the north. He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely. My client is an entrepreneur. I am his lawyer, not his business manager. Deals? My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific. My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well. Good to meet you. What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying? Turned that place completely around. 180 degrees. That's too bad. Ian's got a good thing going over there. You sure? I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London. Don't you work with Ian?Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace. This is un-fucking professional. What shit is this. I just do it. I don't prepare it. Where do we go? Okay. Not bad. Hey. I saw your mother on the Strip last night. She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean? I wouldn't talk. Let him break - he likes to break. While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in. Drugs? Cash? Both if we're lucky. I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of -- -- courier or something. Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer. But Mr. Avery wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere. "He ain't wrong." Listen, I know this asshole who did just go to work for him. Full-time. And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast. That's the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job. Like he'd never hire me for real. Not week-to-week. I don't have the credentials. He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial." You bet. I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation. Something's on. There's more than a measly few grand in this. Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot. Any happier than any other asshole in life. And I said so what. You think she's any happier? So what. Avery said she was tight with his daughter. The L.A.P.D. Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who's driving? Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching. Y'know. Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING. Or BIG FAT GUY. SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS. Wouldn't that be good? Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth. Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it. ... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal. Very attractive. Good idea. Now I really want to fuck you. Jesus, are you gay enough or what. Good luck. Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores? Wow. The forever kind. Yeah. I got half. Five thousand.Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt. Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions? What do you think? Yeah. I know her, all right. She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule. If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw. 'Course, she's nobody's problem now. Jennifer Wilson. So why would he want to see you. He's expecting you? You walked. What the hell are you doing here. How'd you get in here.How we gonna get that lucky? What's in it? I don't get it. Well, we blew it, didn't we? He ain't wrong. Like what. You do? What? There is? We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand. Lemme break. What d'you mean, any happier? I dunno. I just said she's nice lookin'. She's nice lookin'. That don't mean nothin'. Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy. I don't know. Which kind? Makin' trouble for someone? Hey. How much.Because -- No. We can't find ... ... two of our guys. We think someone is here. I sure hope so. The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty. What's the matter? All your life. That happened while I swam the length of my pool. I'm a gracious host. We all did. Sure. Who? I'm sorry. That's what Gordon's always saying. It's just fuel to me. I'm not there for distractions. I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets. Salad bars. I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy. Anything but Japanese. As soon as you get dressed. It's not a compliment. I'm so glad we're having this chat. I'm not. Am I a thing? Not for you, clearly. Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty? Gordon? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks. Is there anything in the world that you want or need? Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum. Adhara. I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation. Well, can we make it one more. Nowhere the fuck near me. You think I'm staying? No. I mean. Not even your people should be involved. Right? It's too close now. Where do you think he is, Mike. I don't know everyone here. He was so traumatized he split. Maybe he was Gordon's pusher . As it happens. I didn't make that part up. I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds. Why, because you're my security consultant? This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down. I thought he was in prison, in England. Our black friends? What kind? What. That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame. It's that simple. Go now. In a couple of days this whole thing -- Go to him. Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp -- Is he here? Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred -- Susan. No trouble. Sure you do. You've made it ... brighter. I miss my kids. Exercising my visitation rights. Hello there. She could've had the deal! I would've handed it to her if she wanted. I would have given her everything. Tell you ... What. Thanks. You, too. I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were. I don't. Ah. Have we met? There's something I can't quite --Yeah? Been to the Boat Show. Just luck, this, really. Never been to one of these before. England. Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing. The lot. The whole British bloody Post Office. I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested? No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman. Lazy sods. Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn. Useless gits. I was gonna do the Post Office once. Yeah, I suppose. Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night. Meet some of the lads. Again? He's gotta know why. That would be too easy. Steady on. One thing I need. Bring the motor around. Bang out in front, right? What are we standing on? First in, first out, that's me. Well, that's what we're doin', n' it. Valets, eh? Aren't we all la-de-da. Valets. What d'ya mean valets. What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster? What's so fucking funny? See what I mean? Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all. They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry. Watch it. Extra muscle. Bodyguards. He's brought in the heavy mob. Butcher's hook. Look. I don't much reckon those minders of his. Gate's open. I had a butcher's at the house. How'd the two of you hook up, then? And that's where you met Jenny. Hang about. I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny. Well, there you are. Jen must've liked him. It's only insurance. Can't be too careful. This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella. They were together how long? Fucking out of order, that. Shouldn't be allowed. I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one? No. Not at all. Do we? Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know. Just popped over on a quick visit. Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all. Sod that. Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to. Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know. Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded. What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages? Nick's a nick, n' it? No matter what state you're in. State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught. I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service. Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever? She didn't write to me, did she. Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they. Did Jenny know? Where abouts? What, tryin' to catch him with another bird? I only asked. This ain't your lot? Y'what? No, not my girl. Self-control, she had. Point of pride. And people don't change, do they. What more is there. Valentine. What's he got to say for himself? This bloke she was bunked up with. This Terry what'sit. No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that. Snuffed her. Who done it, then? It was better than a telegram. Round about, yeah. No reason. You're home, then. Edward Rama? Too bleeding true, 'n' it. You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble. Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ... Bloke told me. That's where Valentine's scarpered. Never thought of that. Busman's holiday. Fancy it? How far? Where's Big Sur? I know that. But as time went on ... well, it wasn't a joke, was it? She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for. Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out. She used to tell me she'd turn me in. Little kid. Ten year old. "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya." She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job. "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will. Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone. I can see her, the phone in her hand. Became a sort of joke between us. Only it wasn't a joke. Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO. Last time might as well've been the first. I remember all the times, don't I. Watching her grow up -- in increments. I fiddle it. They got me down as an immigrant with five kids. I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole. Do us a favor. Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for? Good luck to him. He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts. You sound like my fucking probation officer. Black market during the war. Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill. Watching Doris Day. Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod. Not that I recall. I've got the hang of the driving. Found this place all right. I've 'ardly ever left it. You ever been to London? Honest. Didn't know where to look till I was 21. It's true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start. Just now? Overnight? Get seven years, did you? Did you. What was that in aid of? I'll tell ya something: it made me a model prisoner. Put me right off any escape attempts. Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience? Not bloody likely. Hey? We were lucky to be nicked. Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday. Good job we were still breathing. A jeweller's up the West End. We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work. Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- after we'd made the grab, 'n all. Would you Adam n' Eve it. I can see the attraction. Oh, I was gonna say ... Tell us about it. You don't seem bothered. Early 70's. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly Brixton. And how did you get it? How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you. Among her things. She told you all about my details but not about his. Lovely. I'll bloody well ask him. Depends, don' it. What do you think. What'd you want me to do. Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs. Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All]. Have you ever known me not to be. Why not. This and that. Y'know. Ways and means. Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you. Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly. Various enterprises, style of thing. Based in London, but with international concerns. Proprietor of a London firm. Of longstanding. My employer. -- Mr. Lindgren. Now, you shouldn't run yourself down. My employer, Mr. Lindgren -- Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me. Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it. Eight hours difference between here and London. Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time. I was just coming out on the yard. Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then. Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do. And I'll tell ya: I couldn't open the paper. Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together. That's how weak my hands went. Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't. Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white. I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ... Something had happened to Jen. I already knew. Knew beforehand. When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said. Something like that, yeah. Nah, accommodation address. Nah, we split up when Jenny was six. Her second husband done a runner after she got sick. They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital. We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum. I like to think they're together again now. Y'know. Heavenly choir. Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life. On her own after her mum died. Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned. He give me your address. Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah. Me and him are muckers. Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first. No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know. Getting a car sorted ... Yesterday. Afternoon. Footloose and fancy free. In Jenny? 'Course not. How could I be. 'Course I wasn't. Learnin' 'ow to speak proper. Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen. They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny. She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper. Show up the old man, you know. Yeah, well, she started all that in London. How'd you manage that, then. She never told Eddie, though. Ashamed. I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me. She was always so embarrassed. When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean. Oh, it just ended, then. Said it went on for donkey's years. Weren't you on a television series? Here, are you always this sarky? ... No, I went in for more improving pastimes. Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses. Here, aren't you gonna let me in. Hardly buried. Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that. Sewing mailbags? Me? Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands. It was the bars, then. What was that, then? I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here. How d'you mean? Sort a few things out. Wanted to talk to you, didn't I? She used to pinch 'em off me. Funny that. One thing she never tried to get me to stop. Perhaps it was the smoke. Had a feeling it was you. And that is? As you prefer, squire. As you prefer. Oh, yeah, right. The deal. All of what? No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you. Eh? Nothing financial. Strictly personal. I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned. A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like. Yeah. Shouldn't wonder. Must've done. Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been me for the high jump. Your guess is as good as mine, mate. I'm here on another matter entirely. I can well believe it. I'm sure he has done, son. He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg. Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right. So there's no need to get out of your pram. I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this. Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me. I don't wanna know. Yeah. Cheers, mate. Right. Chain of respect. That's good, that. No kidding. Yeah? Unless I'm not who I think I am. Sorry. Wasn't me. Ian? Yeah. But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking. Could do, yeah. I had to, didn't I. Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States. Well, time off for good behavior, you know. I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place. I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for. I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean. Out on a oil rig. In the North Sea. Nine years. Been away a lot. Yeah. Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return. I would have preferred staying home, me. Yeah, that's right. Where is he, then? Is Valentine here? You know her? I have a message for him. About Jennifer Wilson. I doubt it. Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him? Walked. Why then. Why did you do it! About Jenny. Tell me about Jenny. About the deal . Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard. Tell me. Be seein' you. Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely. Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they? Forgetful. Start thinking they can get away with things. Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention. Great bloke. Really turned things around there. 180 degrees. You must know Ian. EMI in London. I work with Ian. Pleasure.
