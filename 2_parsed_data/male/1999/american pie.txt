Okay then. The rest of you okay with that? Well then keep it coming. Alright, people, good work! Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition. No, it was good. What the hell was that?What the fuck is this? You got someplace more important to be? Christ! I didn't say you were out of the game! You're a killer, Ozzy! Good work, Ostreicher.You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal. Alright, well...you've got to tone it down. You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic. Look, Chris. There are just some things you need to learn, that's all. You need some work, buddy! What did you just say? Sure.When was the last time you looked at the facilities here? Mochaccino. Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter. I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance. When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left. Good morning gentleman. This is no imitation. Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog. Behold -- Ultradog, no dog. Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad. Neither did I! Yes ma'am, I am. So...would you object if I said you're quite striking? Single malt? No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff. ...Nevermind. You have anything to drink? Oh no, no date. Bathroom incident. I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am! Ah, Stifler's mom! Thank you for letting us have a great party. I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age. Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison. Me too. For the most part. First of all, it's Mocha ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh! Charming. Why is this? Easy, tiger. What's in there? What do you suppose they're saying? Seduce her. You'll see. Gotta go. Sixteen minute round trip. Whatever you hear about me, you agree. Uh-huh. Yep.Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school? You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee? Finch! Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan? Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick. Eat your damn imitation hot dog. Uh... Yeah, that's right. I do, baby, I do. Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you. Yeah, I'm the best, baby. No, no that's fine. So you doing okay? Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon. Back out? You don't need us to get laid. You afraid or something? My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question? Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww! Jesus, Kevin, rub it in. She's already on a plane back home. Shut up. You're supposed to be supportive. Holy shit. Please, God. Let this be it. Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no. Oh...oh...oh, shit! That's stupid. But, but -- what would I do? Did I miss anything?! Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch? I don't get it. How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation? Hey, where's Finch? Yeah, enormous. I have no idea. Finch showers in a bathing suit. Exactly three weeks to the day. Yeah, it's like tradition or something. Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it! Pontificated. Like a bet? Sorry, I thought you were dead. But -- What about you? You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base. So, does my hair look better -- like this, or... like this? You can crash at Stifler's? No, "Charming" is old. "Older" is really old. "Youthful mind" is dead. There's our man. You think she was serious? And you said... Dad!! Dad. I know. Hey Nadia. Yes. Dad, please stop. Please. I'm sure I know what you're talking about. It's not what it looks like! Thank you, dad, I got it. Yes dad. Dad! I know! I know, Dad. Okay. Dad, come in. Yeah, sure. Nothing! Oh yeah! Put it in your mouth! Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do? Why, uh, what makes you think that I -- This'll do. ...excuse me?! Okay, I get it. So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds? Yeah, bring it on! I told you. Okay. You want a story? Here's a story. Stifler finds this beer, right? And... Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp. Stifler's mom got it in the divorce. Highly, highly overrated. Whatever you want. Yes. Seriously. Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom? What was your name again? Yeah, that's pretty much it. Hold on. You have no idea why I'm angry? After getting laid? Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there. There it is. I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date. So do I, Kev. No. Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net. I don't think they liked it. Oh -- no way. I can't do that to her. Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good. Hey, you did better than I did, Nova. Apple pie... McDonald's or homemade? So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like? Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer -- Cool Hip Jim... or Laid Back Jim? This was remade? Into what? Ooh, here's an easy one: "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly. No -- Kevin, you? C-Span? A hot cartoon. Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land. Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night? That Ariel, whew. You did it. You've got something going? Hey Sherman. Scopin' the babes. No! I've got...reserve reserves! No, not again. Oh yes. Very arousing women. They arouse me very much. But not as arousing as you. Did you see this? This is your more exotic dirty magazine. No, no, I'm not done! I've got reserves! Nadia, please please please. I'm begging you. Oh no. Nadia, I can't -- Um...okay... Uh... You mean like, strip strip? Strip? Uh...yeah...sorry. Well...uh... So you need to change, right? I suppose that would be okay. Okay...that would be cool sometime. How 'bout tomorrow? Yes. No. Yes. Me? No...you...go...ahead. Yes.Okay, okay. I'll let you hit those books. Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid. Er, guy. Man. Son. This lady's here for you. That's great. Now remember, it's okay to play with yourself. Or, as I always called it -- "Stroke the salami!" Ho-ho, Jim. There's nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating. Uncle Mort masturbates. We all masturbate. Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though. What you're doing is perfectly normal. It's like practice. Like when you play tennis against a wall. Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball. You do want a partner, don't you son? Jim? Okay, well that about covers it. Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate. Do you know about the clitoris? Oh, okay. Here's let me show you. These are for you. From father to son. You're not...busy? Can I come in? What the heck is this?So Oz, you almost made it, huh? Nah. Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing. I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight. But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her. And I don't know what I'm gonna say. So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing. Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever. It's fast acting. I mean really fast. You're gonna shit your pants! Just go! Finch! Get to the bathroom! Now! No idea. You know, Jim...you could go back there...and... What are we gonna hear? Of course, Finch. What? This. Right now. This is your plan, Finch? I don't get it, that really works? Then what the hell are you talking about? Did you guys hook up or something? No comment?! Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically! I don't want to dupe her, Jessica. If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it. I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that. Of course. Well of course I'd want to give her that. I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her? But that one time -- Well...I'm pretty sure I've -- You mean...and orgasm? What? Yeah. I'm not going. No, but come on guys, we made a pact! Oz, how about you and Heather? Now you guys are a couple or something? Alright, how do you guys stand? Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse. Jim? You fuckin' rule! Yeah? Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good. How do you know that? Hey, minuteman. Holy shit! He's going in! Come on, Jim. Where are you? No, you're stupid. Get going! Right now! She's primed! Anything! Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something. Just in time. I'll save you a seat. You can send me the address too. Went home to shit. No -- it's true. He is...really... big. Right. That gives us... Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable. But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny! That's what we are, we keep each other on track. Prior to this day, we've postured. We've procrastinated. We've pretended. We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too. No, a pact . No money involved. This is more important than any bet. Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate. Ow, what the hell? Gotta go. You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base? At least now I know what the hell they're saying. It's all good. Breath check. Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA. Beer in hand by five after. Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old. Finch, you got the Latin homework? I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt." Nothing, I just hugged her back. Oh no, Stifler, what did you do? Ho-lee shit. God dammit, Stifler! Stifler, you're such an asshole. What? Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying. Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but -- It did. I can't believe we just had our senior prom. That was a great night. Victoria...I love you. Okay. Yeah Vick? Like, normal style. The...missionary position. So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it? Yeah, right here. Me too. Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. You comfortable? See -- this is the nicest room. Now?! Yeah, we have something great, Vick. About the other day...I've been thinking. It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving. Hey... I know, Vick. I'm just not ready yet, okay? I didn't say that. I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what? It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong." No, I don't not love you. I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us. Something good. Something special. You want to do it? Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them. Indeed I did. But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot. It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways. We've come a long way since Homecoming. That's my trick! You're not doing the extra credit problems. Just a second! Shhhh. Your parents are downstairs. And I want to try to make it up to you. Yes! I'm a shithead! I'm a complete and total shithead! I was being selfish. And majorly insensitive. And I'm a total idiot. Vicky, wait. Okay, don't stop. Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it? Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship? You got in. "Dear Ms. Hughes. We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected. Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are." It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in. Hey. I got another question for you. Qualify for what? Well, no. I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor. I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do. What?! How do I do that? Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something. To make her, you know... Ready for what? Does it tell me how to get laid? What? Not the Bible? Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother. I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know. What was I gonna do, call dad? I don't even know his number. Yeah, but we'll still see each other. Wow. You two really have something going, don't you? I guess we'll call you two-ply. He didn't? I don't care. It was a pact . You break it and there are no excuses. You guys have to -- Attitude? Me? I think that you guys should be more enthusiastic. Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for. We're in this together. Don't back out on me now! I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it. And that leaves you trailing, Jim. You gotta get your act together. Observe. Nah, you get kind of dizzy though. I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night. Chicks are gonna want to do it. So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance. Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here. Now think about it -- This is different. This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you. Someone to keep you motivated. I put in months of quality time with Vicky. Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores? This is just wrong. That's the spirit. Feeling better, Oz? Then where does a blowjob figure in? How the hell do you know all these random songs? You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch? You ever hear of something called The Bible? Then she said -- she loves me.What's that? You've just inherited The Bible. That's good, that's what I needed to hear. Now you qualify. Uh -- forget that. Look, is that all you're interested in? Ways to get your girlfriend into bed? Try the spicy tuna hand roll. Say that again, Kevin? Whoop, you're fading out. Good luck at that party. You know what, nevermind. You're not ready. Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that. Have you ever heard of the bible? Just dial 976-Asshole. You called me to ask me how to get laid?I'll do it. Oh, well... It came from the heart. Sorry. Sorry, coach. -- Thanks, coach -- Thanks coach. I'm not good in math. ...okay... Like what? Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova. Suck me...beautiful? There's something about the spring that's just cool. Like the smell of fresh rain or something. Great evening, isn't it? I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy. I know, it sucks! You called me Oz. No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score. And this may sound corny, but -- No, that's not what I mean. I mean -- look. You know what made me leave that game? Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score. It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know. There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather. No. I'm missing the game for you. I'm not playing. Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. So I guess...I'll see you later. I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just...I didn't realize it... ...I've got this lacrosse game. It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by... You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor. I know. Salt and pepper? Well, you're not. Oil and vinegar? Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player? I really have no idea. Well, State's got a good business school. And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team. Green peppers? You want onions? Onions? So you're going to Michigan? My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off. Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar. If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it. Uh...my dad's the manager. ...okay. Cool then. I'm um, I'm glad you came by. I mean, really. You talked to Stifler? How did you know I was here? Because I want to. I wasn't making fun of you. What? No I'm not. What?! You don't like it? Nice car. Alright, cool. I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good. Neither will I. Forget it. You can call me Ostreicher. You can call me Oz. Hey, what're you doing here? I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you. I was interested. Yeah...so like, what else do you do? I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that. Oh sure. I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not all that I am. Yeah. Right, uh-huh. I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me. Music is so expressive. Really? Hey, thanks -- Heather, right? After high school. It's true. I mean, after this, everything'll be different. I know. I'll just say that we had a great night together. Come on, Kevin. Vicky's looking for you. I still think you're okay. You've still got a chance with Nadia, right? You can do that? Hey guys, you came to watch me in action? Oh that's really reassuring. And don't call me Nova anymore. I'm a fraud. Feels like warm apple pie, dude. Shortstop. 'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out. Who cares? Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded... "Fun loving" -- insane. You guys got the Latin homework? Is there anything you don't jerk off to? She's a cartoon , dude. She's a mermaid, dude. Illegal channels? Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit. Fuck yeah we will. I think we're falling in love. Yeah. So you want double condiments on that? And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid. ...Guess what? Kevin, it was just a -- Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude? Okay, explain. What reputation? So does your tongue cramp up? Dude, prom sucks. The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite! Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid. No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man? I'm such a loser. Contact, dude. It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic. This was before the cheesy remake. And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide -- Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that. Once, in church, dude. Oh shit dude, the L-word! Our last game is this Saturday. Come on, you know the words, sing along. Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears. Stifler, fuck -- ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive. Yeah ! Dude, watch me work. They go for sensitive studs like me. This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot . Keep it down, dude. Shut the fuck up. Dude, he does not. She works part-time at my dad's store. Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick! Nah, gave her the Heisman. I'm working on something new. Depends if my date wants to stop by. Stifler!!Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy. I am now a man. Did you see that Central chick? Brunette? Indeed. Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment. What's up, fellas?You know. If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about. I don't know if I want to be doing this. Really? Thanks. God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.Me? Nothing. I'm the one whose ass he kicked. I'll tell you one thing, though. I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore. Kevin! You seen Shitbreak lately? This just got a hell of a lot better. Check-out time! Please vacate the room. SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL! Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway? You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you? Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd. No shit. No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week. If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you. Oh my fucking God. You're gay. I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right? Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo. You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss? What the fuck are you doing here? I think you need your balls reattached. You actually said that?! Haaaah!! Hah! Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at her store. Bullshit. From where? Yeah right. I got an idea for something new. How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em. That junior chick? You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface? NOVA!! No way. Doing what? Uh huh. Here, babe. Yep.
