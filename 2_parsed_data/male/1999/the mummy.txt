Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book... And your sister. The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds. You shall see. It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune. What friend? You're my only friend. Do you know where I can steal some? He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible. The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid. This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris. You left me! You left me in the desert to rot. Why do you like to fight so much? Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend! Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good. Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses! O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this! Even? You always did have more balls than brains. Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way. You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell. My very good friend! What a surprise. Then what the hell are you doing here!? What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping! Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody? I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them? In the desert? What for? Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender? Yeah! Them. ...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach? Yeah? All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing. Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'? Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'. You bastards! Water turning to blood. Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold! See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser. The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here. What did you do to him!? The sun turning black. I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon! For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well. Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her. The key!? She has the lost key!? She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.Did you say 'kill' my sister? Excuse me? Oh yes, of course. And how does one do that? And what ritual would that be? You're not going to kill us? Yes,... I see. Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here? Oh. What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!? I found it, Evy! I found it Juicy? Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there. Did you ever see him eat? Still... And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep -- No offense. Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going? Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word. Way to go, Evy. Picked his pocket, actually. That just makes you more gullible. I lie to everybody, what makes you so special? I was mistaken. Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes. Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much. Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich? Yes? Oh yes I do! I have something right here! My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note. Right now, I only wish to join them. Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original. You have got to be joking? He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon. I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it. What? And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back And then he'll be coming after Evy. Yes, I know, I do that to people. That looked rather painful. Who's here!? Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers! He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him. You did not!?... We're not!? What are you going to do? Shoot him? Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we? Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out. OWCH! That's really got to hurt. We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them. And it stinks to high heaven in here. That thing gives me the creeps. Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it? I can't believe the price of these fleabags. Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player. Um, well, you see... She's my sister, actually.Well, okay then. I never killed a priest before. Who the hell are these guys? You know where he's taking her? Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath? Relax, I got him. What does he want the book for? What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat. Immune from what? Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you? Where's your new friend? Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples. Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we? Oh, hey, how ya doin'? Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. So who's this guy? Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to? 'Cause I look good doin, it. C'mon, friend. Goin' somewhere? I've had worse. Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river! Sounds familiar. Let's make us even, shall we? The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble. So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot? Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you. None of the above, thank you. Altar boys? How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways? Now go find me a big stick. Shut-up and gimme your bandolier. Don't tell me we gotta go back out there? You think it'll send this guy back to hell? So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold -- Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about? Try me. I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here. Got guts, lady. Don't do it, Evelyn. Got what? Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face? What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech. He's here! I saw him! That thing is here! FINE. You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot. Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated. Yeah? So? Is that my problem? There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here! We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing. Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone. You sure you outta be playin, around with that? The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues. That bad huh? Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive? Is he supposed to look like that? You dream about dead guys? Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had. Because that's my name. Not unless you call me Rick. No you're not. And what is that? Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here? Something like that. Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew. You don't believe in curses, huh? Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap. Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed. Who was talking about what? There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior? Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling? Yeah, that'd bring you back to life. Preparation for what? What are those mirrors for? The things that get you excited. We're about to be shown the way. We're almost there. Trust me. Can you swim? Relax! I'm the map! It's all up here. I know my treasure. And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right? Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell." There's something out there, you know, something under that sand. The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died. Still angry that I kissed ya, huh? Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya. Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- ! Really want to know? Want to know? I found sand. I saw death. -- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead. Every damn day. Yeah, I was there. I just decked your brother Because that's where I found it. I was there. No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra. No. So who's the broad? Do something, Jonathan! Kill it! Got it. Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like? We gotta get her back. What? Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life. Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go. Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap. The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY! That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague! Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter. Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer. If he decides to wake up, hell yes! Where's my gun? Tough break. No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing, Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils? And you're sure you can find the secret compartment? None taken. You're welcome to my share of the spider webs. Be nice. That thing saved my life. Awfully. We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister. I only gamble with my life, never my money. Hey,... don't I know you? Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.Who cares? I don't see no treasure. I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much. A bright good morning to all. Forty. Fifty percent. Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly? You lie. Proceed! I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang. No women allowed. To be hanged. He said... he was just looking for a good time. I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
