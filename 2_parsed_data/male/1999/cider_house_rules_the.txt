Do you think we could have a look at  someone a little different? Don't be frightened. Everyone is  nice here. I just belong here. Dr. Larch! Dr. Larch! We've got two new patients, one to  deliver. Yes, for both. All I said was, I don't want to  perform abortions. I have no argument  with *you* performing them. One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask  how to do it--you just showed me. That was good, Carla--that was  *perfect*. Everything's fine. We won't tell you, Carla. You're  going to be okay. There was no visible wound? It looks like scurvy. Did you look in her purse? It's obviously an aborticide. I don't know it. In other words, scurvy. I'll help you. He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen  him do it! It's because he's too tired to sleep.  He has to. He *smells* like he could put you to  sleep! He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell  like ether. *You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't  smell like ether. I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been  to medical school--I haven't even  been to high school! But you've studied with the old man  for *years*! I'm *not* a doctor! I'm sorry, Homer. I haven't read that. But isn't Fuzzy just... well,  underdeveloped? What is it, Mary Agnes? Did you bite it? It looks like you bit it--it'll be  all right. No, you did it yourself. Maybe in  your sleep. Story time, Fuzzy! Why does Dr. Larch *do* tht every  night? No, you jerk. Dr. Larch *loves* us! But why does he do *that*? He does it because we like it. They're *our* snowballs! They *stole*  them! Nobody's named this one yet. He doesn't like it. He's a boy, That's why. I don't think so. Henceforth you shall be... Little  Wilbur. Okay, he's just a Wilbur then. They picked Hazel! The idiots chose  Hazel! Hi, Curly. You going somewhere? They wanted a girl. You're one of the best, Curly--we  couldn't let just anyone take you. That's true. Nobody special enough, Curly. Only the right people can have you,  Curly. Are you okay? Can I get you anything? Okay. Do you ever think about leaving this  place to go find them? I mean your parents. I know who you mean. I think about  leaving here, but not to find *them*. Why not? Whoever they were, they didn't *do*  any of the things parents are supposed  to do. Dr. Larch did those things,  and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela. Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could  meet mine, anyway. What for, Buster? What would you do  if you met them? Uh... I'd like to show them that I  can cook, a little. You cook very well! And that I can drive a truck! Better than I can! Sometimes I want to meet them so I  can kill them. Just sometimes. Homer, you know I would never kill  anyone--you know I wouldn't. I know. I think Mary Agnes could kill someone. I doubt it. She's just an... ...emotional girl. What's she so emotional about? I don't know. She got left here,  like the rest of us, didn't she? He thinks she's his *mother*! He doesn't think she's his mother,  Fuzzy. He does so! He *loves* her! It's *your* splice! You blame me for  everything! She's a patient, right? She should  see a doctor. I just mean I'd rather fix the movie.  Tonight. Homer... doesn't King Kong think the  woman is his *mother*? Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks,  all right. That's why Kong loves her! I thought it was my turn. "Whether I shall turn out to be the  hero of my own life, or whether that  station will be held by anybody else,  these pages must show." "I was a posthumous child. My father's  eyes had closed upon the light of  this world six months, when mine  opened on it." His father's dead, right? "There is something strange to me,  even now, in the reflection that he  never saw me..." Is *your* father dead? *Liver* killed him? But did you know him? Did you know your mother better? What's a nanny do? Did you grow up around here? What's an immigrant? She's at least *five*. Stuck *what* inside you? What'd she die of? How about expecting people to be  responsible enough to control  themselves to begin with? I didn't mean her. I'm talking  about... adults. You know who I mean! What?! I'm happy I amuse you. Try to look at it *this* way. Buster  and I are sitting right here beside  you. We could have ended up in the  incinerator! Happy to be alive... I guess so. Well, this *is* an orphanage. The best? Wow! The best at *what*? I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing  a car like this. It's okay--I don't mind. We brought some chocolates for the  kids. So, Mrs... Wally. Wally Worthington. How many months are you? So, now, uh... you're not... I mean,  do *you* do the-- No. Dr. Larch will be performing the  procedure. Ah, well... okay. Good! I just  wondered... Sure. Fine. Have you prepped him? I think it was the ether--the smell  got to me. God. This is all my fault. What kind of plane are you flying? A B-24 Liberator. Liberator... Have you enlisted? They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect. Really! Is it serious? No, it's not serious. I'm just not  supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep  calm all the time. Oh, well. I don't imagine there's  any strain or stress around *here*! How is she doing? It's all over, honey. Homer, when is Halloween? Uh... it's the end of October. Is that soon? That's a few months away, Fuzz. I still don't feel so good. Oh. It's the best time! How come we  only get pumpkins once a year? Don't get too excited, Fuzzy. Why can't we have pumpkins for  Christmas, too? We don't get any  good presents at Christmas, anyway. Has anyone offered you anything to  eat? Actually, someone did. I just didn't  think I could eat anything. I wonder if you might give me a ride. Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where? Where are you going? We're heading back to Cape Kenneth. Cape Kenneth... That sounds fine. I wasn't intending to leave here in  order to be entirely useless--I expect  I'll find some ways to be of use. Of course. You know I'm grateful for everything  you've done for me... I don't need this--I know all about  my condition. I don't want you to walk--I want to  carry you. Should I put the top up?  It might get cold. I have to go, Curly. I'm sorry. I couldn't find Buster. Will you  tell him... Good night, Homer! Good night, Homer! Good night, Homer!  Good night, Homer Wells! Actually, the Army has given me leave  twice. First when my father died,  and now I'm on leave to help my mother-- I'm just trying to get her ready for  the harvest. She's no farmer. Apples  were my dad's business. And with the  war on, she's short on pickers. I never said they were boring. Well, they aren't. I think I'd probably like the apple  business. You're a little overqualified, aren't  you? No, I'm not. I need a job. The only jobs are picking jobs.  Picking apples is truly boring. Well, *picking* them is! It's about  as exciting as... walking! Is your family in the apple business,  too? I've never seen a lobster. I've never seen the ocean, either. You've never seen the *ocean*? That's not funny... that's *serious*. I know. Where's Mandalay? Oh... I understand. Honey, honey... of course I'll come  back. This is all normal. Don't worry. The  abortion procedure... it affects  you. It's the ether, too. It'll take  a little time. I don't *have* any time. There's a  *war*! It's all very normal. You ought to cut that shit out--it's  terrible for you. It should taper off tomorrow, but it  can come back again. You have cramps? They'll ease up, almost entirely. As  long as the bleeding isn't heavy,  it's normal. Catch! Give it here! What was *that*?! Come over here! It's called the Burma run. It's about  a seven-hour round-trip flight between  India and China. "Burma run" because you fly over  Burma... *And* over the Himalayas. That's  called flying over the hump. At what altitude? I've got thirty-five minutes to climb  to fifteen thousand feet--that's the  first mountain pass. What lousy luck--I mean your orders...  to draw an assignment like that! Actually, I volunteered. It's the flying, right? You love to  fly, don't you? I love the bombing, too. But there's  also the Himalayas--they have the  most wicked air currents in the world.  I wouldn't miss flying there for  anything. Uh, look... if you're serious about  wanting a job, picking apples isn't  that boring. Oh, I would love that, Wally. Sure... I'll see you around. I love you, too. See you tomorrow. Come on. You have to meet my mom. If it comes up, I've been at a  wedding. That's where I met you, at  the wedding. Wally? I expected you earlier... This is Homer Wells--he's the most  overqualified apple picker you'll  ever meet, but he's dying to learn  the apple business. How do you do, Homer Wells... How do you do... Were you a friend of the bride or  the groom? Homer is everybody's friend, Mom...  the bride's, the groom's, mine,  Candy's, *everybody's*. Well, perhaps you'll come to dinner,  Homer... Not tonight, Mom--he's got to meet  *Mr. Rose*! You already used up the hot water! You're usin' my soap, ain't you? I ain't usin' no soap--it's too cold  to bother with soap! There ain't never enough hot water,  soap or no soap. They're migrants. Migrants? Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds.  They travel up and down the coast  with the seasons. The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have  to let him be the boss. Rose, this is Homer--Homer, this is  Mr. Rose's daughter, Rose. Rose Rose? No, no--Homer is a new *picker*.  He's going to stay here with you. That daughter of mine sure is Miss  Hospitality, ain't she, Wally? You got lots of experience pickin',  I suppose. Homer's got no experience, Arthur,  but he's smarter then I am. He's a  fast learner. This is history. Ain't that what  you're sayin', Wally? I guess we  makin' *history*... havin' this young  man stay with us! See you later. So. What should I do now? Out back, there's a shed. It's just  a mess. If that shed was better  organized, I could put my truck in  there. If you're as smart as Wally says,  you know you sometimes gotta do one  job before you do another. You did a good job with that shed,  Homer. It's the name of a cat. Originally.  Well, not *originally*. Now, now--we all got names, sensible  or not. Peaches is from Georgia, where we  met him pickin' peaches. He's still  better with peaches than hs is with  apples. Jack here is new. And this here is  Hero, 'cause he was a hero of some  kind or other once. Ain't that right,  Hero? And this here sensitive-lookin' fella  is Muddy. The less said about Muddy,  the better. Ain't that right, Muddy? It's just my heart. There's a little something wrong  with it. Just this part here--the  right ventricle. It's slightly  enlarged. Yes, so what. It's nothing serious,  really. Just a small defect. It's big enough to keep you out of  the war, I suppose. Ain't that right? Right. They told me I was too old to serve. And you was "generally unfit," as I  recall. Do you like to read? "I looked at the stars, and considered  how awful it would be for a man to  turn his face to them as he froze to  death, and see no help or pity in  all the glittering multitude." More? Since you're the one who's smart  enough to read... what's this? It's a list of rules, it seems. They're for us, I suppose. Go on and read 'em, Homer. "One. Please don't smoke in bed." Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules.  We didn't write them. I don't see no  reason to read them. Okay... Remember this! In the morning, when  the tall grass is wet, you can make  the Jeep slide on the grass. Can you  feel it? It's almost like flying. What about the trees? The trees are flak--antiaircraft  fire from those geeks on the ground. I was just showing Homer the  orchards... kind of a geography  lesson. He *loved* it! Didn't you? Yeah, it was great. *Homer* liked it! Didn't you? Yeah, sure. There's no stress or  strain around here... What's wrong with you? That's Vernon. You best stay away  from him until he gets to know you  better--then you best stay away from  him *more*! Out lieutenant's calling you, Homer.  Mind your ass. You getting along okay? Where is that Candy? Wally's gonna marry *me* if Candy  leaves him! You girls make it hard for a guy to  go off to war. But I'll leave my best man here to  pinch-hit for me. Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I  thought. I just wanted to be sure  you were settled in--and happy enough,  considering... Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick  it out for a bit? Uh... actually, picking apples is as  much excitement as I want for a while.  I'm grateful for the job. You're the one who's helping *me*,  Homer. You're going to give my mom a  little peace of mind while I'm gone.  Candy, too. Well, sure... that's good, then. All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you. I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the  lucky one. You want to fight about it? You pickin' more cider apples then  anythin' else. Them drops is good  only for cider. And you pickin' the  stems with the apples only half the  time. They good only for cider, too-- if you don't pick them stems. The rule is, you wanna pick the apple  *with* the stem, Homer. And see  here... see that *bud* that's just  above the stem? That's the bud for  *next year's* apple--that's called  the *spur*. You pick the spur, you  pickin' two years in one--you pickin'  next year's apple 'fore it have a  chance to grow. You leave that on  the branch, you hear? That's better. I can tell you got  yourself some education. Them's good  hands you got, Homer. Them hands you  got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right? I guess so... Who cares? Now, now. He's a good boy. Shit. We don't know what he is. Jack, you gotta watch your language  'round my daughter. Here he is. Where's your manners? Make room for  Homer, so's he can enjoy the view. What view? Are we supposed to be up here? The  rules said... Homer, you the only one who's read  them rules, so you the only one who  feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong. *What* view? Well, Muddy, we can look at all these  angry stars Homer's been readin' to  us about. I bet the view looks better from the  Worthin'tons'. You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't  want to be in that Wally's shoes  tonight. You lucky you in your work boots  tonight, girl... You know where that Wally is tonight,  darlin'? He's up there in them angry  stars. He's flyin' all around up there...  with them Japs shooting at him. They all on board, Mrs. Worthin'ton. Thank you, Arthur. And how is our Homer working out? Oh, he's a smart young man, most of  the time--Wally was right about him. No rotten apples? No, no--not this year. Well... maybe  we got *one*, but it ain't Homer. Rose... dear girl, I'm sure I can  find you some other clothes. You must have some things that would  fit her. Now, now, Candy--this girl don't  need no more clothes, not for pickin'. Arthur, there's no such thing as a  young woman who's got all the clothes  she needs. I'm *never* bored! It's all very...  different for me... here. Uh... have you been *feeling* okay? Okay... I better go. Don't let us make you nervous or  nothin'--we know you gotta job to  do. Yeah, we can wait all night for the  water to come back on--you just go  on and take your time. Hungry? They're the garbage-eaters of the  ocean's floor. The seagulls clean up  the shore. The lobsters clean up the  bottom of the sea. They eat everything? Everything that falls to the bottom. I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I  was gonna show it to Homer... They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington! He mentions Homer, too, you know. Oh! That's... nice. Wally said the most spectacular hits  were in the oil fields at Yenangyat. A movie *outside*? People watched the movies in their  cars? Yes! I've only seen one, though. "King Kong". It's really good. I *did* like it. All I said was,  "It's not 'King Kong'." First she loved him, then she didn't,  then no one else could have him... And what did she die of, exactly? Oh, sure! What's the *medical* explanation? At least King Kong knew what he  *wanted*. He's makin' history, I suppose. No trouble. She's about the most beautiful girl  I ever seen--I don't know if she's  the nicest. She's the nicest *and* the most  beautiful girl I've ever known. That's right--that sounds like trouble  to me. I'm not in trouble. But he looks like an excellent young  man, a first-rate candidate! But, Dr. Larch, he seems exceptionally  qualified... We're *very* interested! You wouldn't be opposed to meeting  with him? Very *Maine*, a very *local*-sounding  name. Cider don't have no taste till later  in October--it's too watery now,  when we're usin' just them early  Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't  get no *good* cider till you're  pickin' them Golden Delicious and  them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins  and them Russerts... What about the worms? Most of these  apples are the drops--off the ground,  right? There have to be worms. Of *course* there's worms, Homer!  And what is them worms, really? They  just *protein*, them worms! They is  *good* for you! That just ain't right, Jack--your  cigarette's gonna end up in nine or  ten gallons of this batch of cider!  That ain't right. Them people drinkin' that cider,  they don't know there's a cigarette  in there! It's not that hard to find it in  there, Jack--it'll take you just a  minute. You just gotta go fishin'. You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin'  in that vat to fish out no cigarette! What business is you in, Jack? Just  tell me what your business is... Just say you're in the *apple*  business, man. That's the only  business you wanna be in. Just say  it. What business are *you* in? I'm in the *knife* business, Jack.  You don't wanna go in the knife  business with me. You're lucky he didn't cut your  *nipples* off, man. Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to  find when you're properly undressed. Give men that. I know how to do it. Almost. I don't need no "almost" a doctor,  Homer. Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs  to know what business he's in. You oughta know you don't go to jail  for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't  that right, Homer? You think? Maybe I was. I love this place! The screen is enormous! Imagine King  Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot  of movies here? You don't care about the movie? It was my favorite night at the  orphanage--movie night. We'd race  into the dining hall. Of course  everyone wanted to sit in front, so  we'd be packed in so tight you could  feel the kid next to you breathing. I didn't say that. Growing up in an  orphanage, you're always lonely.  You're just never alone. You're not alone in the bathroom,  or... or in the shower... you're  never alone in wanting the last piece  of meatloaaf, or even in your own  bed on a cold morning. I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys. I never *asked* for any  responsibility. Did you come here with Wally--to  *not* watch movies? Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio? How could you not *care* about the  movie? That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd  watch the movie. What are you going to tell the little  ones? Why would the little ones believe  that *anyone* would adopt him? Shouldn't we tell Homer? It was a family with a better  breathing machine then the one Dr.  Larch built. The family that adopted Fuzzy, they  *invented* the breathing machine.  It's their business... breathing  machines. Good night, Fuzzy! Good night, Fuzzy!  Good night, Fuzzy Stone! Some mail for you, Homer. And some clothes for you, dear-- let's go see if they fit. Mind your own business, Peaches. Aren't you worried that people will  cut their feet? Right. Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a  big hurry. This is easy--I'm not hurrying. You still doin' it too fast! Just tell me. Do you want me to go?  Do you want me to stay? *What* will be okay? I'll just move on, get another job  somewhere. Every time you throw a snail off the  dock, you're makin' someone start  his whole life over. It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack  it in. I used to hate it when Wally went  back to college--even when it was  just college! And this was when his  father was still alive... I hated it  even then. Naturally I hate this  more. What I mean is... I would like it  very much if you thought you could  be happy here, Homer. Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very  lucky to be here. There's not a lot of work in the  winter, and you'll have to tolerate  Vernon--even Wally despises him, and  Wally likes everyone. I think Wally will be fine, Mrs.  Worthington--he seems indestructible  to me. I don't know. Just promise me one thing. Uh... sure. Just promise me that, if there's a  blizzard, you'll move into Wally's  room until it's over. Good-bye. Have a safe trip home.  Thank you, again, for all your hard  work. You take care now, Mrs. Worthin'ton. Good-bye, Arthur. Homer, I'll see you tomorrow? Right. We all set, I think. You all take care of yourself, too,  Homer! Don't freeze to death, Homer. Go on and freeze to death if you  want to, Homer. Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right. I'm just waiting and seeing. Like  you said. Dear Dr. Larch, thank you for your  doctor's bag... ...although it seems that I will not  have the occasion to use it. Barring some emergency, of course. I  am not a doctor. With all due respect  to your profession. I am enjoying my  life here. I've looked at so many women... I  mean, I've seen *everything* about  them, *everything*... but I never  felt a thing. I felt nothing. Now...  with you... it *hurts*... to look at  you. I am enjoying being a lobsterman and  an orchardman--in fact, I have never  enjoyed myself so much. The truth is, I want to stay here. I  believe I am being of *some* use. Dear Dr. Larch, what I am learning  here may not be as important as what  I learned from you, but everything  is new to me. Yesterday I learned  how to poison mice. You use poison  oats and poison corn. Field mice girdle an apple tree.  Pine mice kill the roots. I *know*  what you have to do--you have to  play God. Well... killing mice is as  close as I want to come to playing  God. I am not a doctor. I can't replace you! I'm sorry... Who's that? It's that Candy, too... Don't this place look like home? What have you two been doin' to make  it look so nice? ...bridges, oil refineries, fuel  depots... Where's Jack? He just wasn't up for the trip. That Jack just never knew what his  business was. You pickin' nothin' but cider apples,  Peaches--I hope you understand that. Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they  ain't no better than drops to me.  See that bruise, and that one? *Half*  of these is bruised! Look at this  one! It ain't got no stem! You might  as well *step* on 'em, too--they  only good for cider. So we should "wait and see." For how  long? Fine. That's all there is to it then. Okay, okay--I know you do, too. She ain't hungry, maybe. She ain't hungry every mornin' 'cause  she's sick every mornin'. You okay, Rose? I don't like watching anyone be sick. How many months are you? You're not yet three months, are  you? I know more than I want to know about  it. Who's the father? But you don't look very happy. Rose, please listen. Whatever you  want to do, I can help you. What I mean is, if you don't want  to... keep the baby, I know a place  where you can go. Rose, listen--don't *do* anything.  You know, I mean to yourself. Please  listen... Homer! Is this a workin' day or what? I told her! She doesn't feel she can  do that. Something about her father  not letting her go anywhere... I'll be up top... Well, we can't force her. It's her  decision. Mr. Rose *knows*? Wait... *wait*! Are you sure? I didn't see where you was pickin'  this mornin', Homer, but you musta  worked up a big appetite. You look  like you're serious about gettin' to  your lunch today! Is it true? Are you sleeping with your own  daughter? I think you been stayin' up too late  at night, Homer. You're actually having sex with your  own little girl? Is that possible? Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my  little girl, Homer--that's somethin'  a father knows. You're lying. How can you... with  your own daughter! Homer, don't you know what business  you in? You don't wanna go into no  business with me, Homer--ain't that  right? Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other  clothes. You a fine one to be talkin' about  lies. Shame! These people took you  in. That boy Wally's at *war*! But she's your *daughter*... And I *love* her! There ain't nobody  else gonna treat her as good as I  do! I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her,  Homer--you must know that. She's *pregnant*. Do you know *that*? Don't mess in this, Homer, if you  know what's good for you. How long's this been going on, Muddy? Long enough. You ain't gonna stop  it. There's my knife, Homer. It ain't  gonna do *me* no good. You give that  knife to Rose Rose, you hear? You best just watch you ass, Homer!  You don't wanna end up like Jack! When the plane was hit, the crew  chief and the radioman jumped close  together. The copilot jumped third.  All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the  plane. None of the men of the ground  could see the sky--that's how thick  the jungle was. They never saw the  plane crash--they never *heard* it  crash. They never saw Captain  Worthington's parachute, either. Why was he missing for twenty days? Because the crew thought he'd gone  down with the plane. They were  hospitalized for almost a week in  China before they were flown back to  India. It wasn't until that they  sorted through their gear... Three men jumped from the plane, but  they had four compasses with them.  One of the crew jumped with Captain  Worthington's compass. He followed the Irrawaddy River, all  the way to Rangoon. Somehow he managed  to avoid the Japs, but not the  mosquitoes. Then it's malaria? It's encephalitis B. He's recovering  at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon. Uh... Captain Worthington is  paralyzed. Waist down. He won't walk. I'm sorry. There are no autonomic effects, are  there? No autonomic effects... that's  correct. When will he be home, Major? Four weeks or so, right around  Halloween. There are no autonomic effects, just  the paralysis of the lower  extremities. Wally can have kids, a normal sex  life... How about him not needin' the friggin'  compass! How about that? Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already. Good night, Ray. Just tell me. I'll do whatever you  want to do. Isn't that like waiting and seeing? I know. Is *that* nothing. It's a tempting idea, I know... to  do nothing. *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That  would be *doing* something, wouldn't  it? We wouldn't want to *do*  something. Let's just sit here all  night! I'm not trying to be anything--I'm  just doing nothing! If I wait and  see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my  mind! Decisions can be painful, after  all... You got up! You *did* something! If  you keep this up, you might be in  danger of making a *decision*! I know, I'm sorry. He's *alive*. He still loves you. So do I. Nothing. You're not the one who has  to do anything. Where do you think you're going? You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle  of the night, girl! Hey, hey! Stop it. Maybe I can help. You just go inside, Homer. We don't  need no help. Please listen to me! *Both* of you... You forget yourself, Homer. This  here's my daughter! You got your own  mess to deal with--ain't that right? What business is you in, Homer? Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor*  business. If you want, I can help you. You  don't have to go anywhere. What's that? What's it called? One cervical stabilizer, two sets of  dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium  speculum, one large; two vulsellum  forceps. There ain't no *almost* about this  stuff, Homer--ain't that right? Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads,  gauze--lots of gauze. When it comes to this, you is the  real thing--is that what you sayin'? No *almost* about it--I'm a doctor. Get out of here, please. I'm stayin', Homer. Okay. Then you can be of use. You better get some air. It's that Vernon--he keeps askin'  where you and Homer and Rose Rose is  at. Tell that Vernon to mind his own  business, Muddy. I told him that you all is sick. Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you*  is the crew boss today. Why don't you put them damn rules in  the wood stove, Peaches? "One: Please don't smoke in bed." We heard that one already, Homer. "Two: Please don't go up to the roof  to eat your lunch." "Three: Please--even if you are very  hot--do not go up to the roof to  sleep." What do they think? They must think  we're crazy! They think we're dumb niggers so we  need dumb rules--that's what they  think. This is the last one. "Four: There should be no going up  on the roof at night." Yeah, they don't want us up there  *at all*! That's it. Who *live* here in this cider house,  Peaches? Who grind them apples, who  press that cider, who clean up the  mess, and who just plain *live*  here... just breathin' in the vinegar? Somebody who *don't* live here made  them rules. Them rules ain't for  *us*. *We* the ones who make up them  rules. We makin' our *own* rules,  every day. Ain't that right, Homer? Right. No, that's not it--I just want to be  sure I understand you. I *helped* you not to think about  Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't  stand worrying about him, about his  being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could  stop worrying... well, for a while,  anyway. This is how I helped you,  right? "...did." Well, okay. And now that Wally's coming back,  and because he'll certainly *need*  you... At least there's no more waiting and  seeing. At least I got to see the  ocean. Rose Rose has runned away! She took off on the bicycle, man. Ain't nobody gonna find her, Homer-- she's long gone. I swear, I didn't try and stop her-- I just wanna touch her hand before  she go. That's all I wanna do, I  swear. Where'd she get that knife, Muddy?  That looked like *your* knife--what  I seen of it. If that was your knife, Muddy, I  wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'*  if she don't got a good knife with  her. Where'd she get you? She just plan misunderstand me--I  was tryin' to give her my knife, I  was just reachin' to touch her hand.  But I understand if she misunderstand  me--it's all my fault, ain't that  right? It's too late for the doctor now,  Homer--ain't that right? She's *good* with that knife! She's  real fast. She's a lot better with  that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And  who do you suppose taught her? *You* taught her, I suppose... That's right! A girl's gotta know  how to defend herself, don't she? There's more than one laceration,  more than one cut. That's 'cause I sticked my *own*  knife in the wound--after she go, I  sticked my *own* knife in there. I  poked it all around, I just tryin'  to find the same place she got me. You listen to me: you tell them police  how this happen, you tell it *this*  way, you hear? My daughter, she runned  off--and I so sad about it that I  stabbed myself. I so unhappy that  she gone, I killed myself--that what  you say, you hear? That the true  story--ain't that right? Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy  she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that  right? Right? That what happen--you lost you only  daughter so's you killed yourself!  That's what we say, all right. That's right. I know you understand  how I feel, Homer--you is breakin'  them rules, too. Ain't that right? She knows how to take care of herself. Sure. Thanks. I'm sorry for what I said about Wally  needing you. It was... unnecessary. No. You warned me. I didn't listen,  but you warned me. You told me you weren't any good at  being alone. You told Wally, too. Right? He's going to be fine, Wally's going  to be fine. I know he is. Dr. Larch? Dr. Larch? Good night, Dr. Larch! Good night,  Dr. Larch! Good night, Dr. Larch! You ever see a palm tree, Homer? Ain't you sick of pine trees, Homer? The Sunshine State! Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with  you. But I've got to move on. Yeah, well... you could move on with  *us*, man! You could move on somewhere  *warm*! You know what? I did. It's from the ocean. It's for you. What are you doing here? Sure. It's my heart. Fuzzy's?! "Thus I began my new life, in a new  name, and with everything new about  me... I felt... like one in a dream...  The remembrance of that life is  fraught with so much... want of  hope... Whether it lasted for a year,  or more, or less, I do not know. I  only know that it was, and ceased to  be; and... there I leave it." That's tomorrow, Curly. Let's mot  give the story away. Good night, you Princes of Maine!  You Kings of New England!
