We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?" Hidden camera. Just get in the van, Josie.You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom? Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea. Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year. Sometimes opposites attract. Hey Josie. It's Josie, right? Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie. Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica? By Guy? He is totally crunching on you. : Wait. Do you know any gay guys? You crossed over. Josie, you have totally transitioned. I think it's pronounced gauche. Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.No Roger from op/ed? Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night. Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand. Leave. YOU DID. Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating. I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter. Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us. Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it. And that's the best part. "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it! It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system-- That's your story! I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece. No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story. OUT! Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it. Do you even know these kids? This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo! Have you been to any parties? Have you been there? Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night." No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune. Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing! And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?! You're a sick puppy, Geller. Geller, this is way out of your league. Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out. Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls. A flack jacket. You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters? Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter. Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it. Eh. How many times have I fired her? So. You and Roger in Op/Ed. Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world. My sword. Hey--what are you thinking about? You having fun? Cool. I'll catch you later. Rufus. But I don't even know where you live. I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but- I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there. Hey there. Yeah, you gonna be there? Dude, you rock! Are you in special ed?Aloha! Welcome! Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up! I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up. No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys? No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me? I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age. Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay. I know. Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business". Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus. Wow, Josie- you look really- And a gymnast! With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one. This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was! I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time! No. Josie, this is real. That's the spirit! Plus, if you quit you're no better than me. Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story? Little known fact. Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it. Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore. Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team. Why is that impossible? These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here! No, I mean, no big whoop. No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn. I know. I came up with it. You look nauseous. Don't you remember what they called you? Do you remember high school? Wow. This must be big. You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life! Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you! Someday this luau is going to be all mine! I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life. See! No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list. She just needs a new windshield wiper. No it's not. Guys name their penises. Relax, Monty. It's just my sister. I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time. I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches. Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today? Wow - I- Maybe we should sit. Yeah. Definitely. Well, a ball player. Thank you. I'm Rob.What about the "Roaring Twenties"ï¿½ or "The 80's"? Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea. I thought this was a 45-minute seminar. You're Pam? Hi. You're here for the sex talk? I told you you could write, Josie Geller. I just can't look at you the same way. The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker. Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist! You set me up. For a story. You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you. Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical. What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you? "Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?! So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth? No, I'm alone. Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on. Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen. Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story. told him --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate! No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you. Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth! Yeah, actually I do. Our penguin, right? Yeah. To watch the world go by.-- That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody. Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common. You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude. I'm thinking when I'm home. Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought. I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher. I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me. You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you. I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages. Boys. You have to say that. You're my student. God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all. Okay This is okay. Smooth. Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class? Yoooooow. You remember that story? Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me. I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights. This seat taken? Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words-- in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--" Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural. That's crazy. I'll get you some applications. So what are you thinking for college? Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker. Hey, Josie, hold on. You've been hiding something from me. Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's. True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope. Are you sure you're seventeen? Not the happiest of souls. "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop." You like her? Whoa. Deja Vu. Hi, everyone. I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
