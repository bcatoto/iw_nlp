He was killed serving Project Mayhem. He was killed in action. The garden. Take him there. Move, people. Let's do this! The first rule of Project -- That wouldn't interest you.You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution. They say he only sleeps one hour a night. You know about this guy? Tyler Durden? That's a fucking great, man! Fucking great! Congratulations. You are?! And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule... The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it... No. I found something new. Better than I've ever been in my life. Cornelius! How are you? ...using steroids. I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake. Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls... They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid. We're still men.Just who the fuck do you think you are?! Get out! You're fired! Okay. Where to begin? With your constant absenteeism? With your unpresentable appearance? You're up for review... Pretend you're me. You find this. What would you do? You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine. "The second rule of fight club... Is this yours? Is that your blood? Have you finished those reports? Here are your flight coupons. Call me from the road if there are any snags. Your itinerary... You need to make these your primary "action items." I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week. We've got some "red-flags" to cover.Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call. In the meantime, don't leave town. I may need to bring you in for questioning. I'll ask the questions, son. Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion. The gas, it seems, was just a detonator. It means it was homemade. Yes. It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means? The dynamite... Does this sound strange to you? I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder. This is Detective Stern with the arson unit. We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.You want to see pain? Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights. See the guys with testicular cancer. That's pain. You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise. You need to lighten up. No, you can't die of insomnia.No! Look at you! You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things... Get your hands off him! Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?! This is a man... ! You killed him! What... ? Right, right. Where's Tyler? You are a moron. Look at my face. I'm a member. I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden. There's no one else here. I need to know where Tyler is. Can't you help me? Yeah, both of us. Look at my face. Bob, Bob... I'm a member. Oh. Really, what's that? Really? Great. Still "Remaining Men Together?" Bob. I'm okay. How are you? Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one. Bob was a champion bodybuilder. You know that chest expansion program you see on TV? That was his idea. Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed. Then hormone therapy. He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen. That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big. Yes. We're men. Men is what we are. This was a support group for men with testicular cancer. The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob. What about this? Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant. In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut. I won't need to come to the office. I can do this job from home. Let's pretend. You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects? Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles. Fuel injectors that burn people alive. I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise. We need to talk. "Abuse" the copy machine. There's an image. Hmm? I must've left the original in the copy machine. Some of it, yes. Yes. After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down. You can deal with anything. He was full of pep. Must've had his grande latte enema. You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade? It must've been Tuesday. he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie. I'd like to thank the academy... No. No, sir. I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me. The dishes were me. The plants were... Who do you think could've done this? This is... really a shock... What does that mean? Dynamite? Yes, sire, strange. Very strange. I am Jack's Cold Sweat. No, I wasn't aware... Yes? I'm in pain. Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals. Can't you give me something? Maybe I died already. Look at my face. I did, I think. But, I'm okay... I'm fine... Yes. Don't ask. Yes, fine. Just, get on. Stay away a couple of weeks, at least. I can't let myself see where you're going. Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities... I'm begging you. Get on the bus. Get on the bus. Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again. Here... here... Do this for me, Marla. Do this for me, if you never do anything else... I'm sorry, but I... Marla... You have to get out of here. Leave as soon as possible. Go to any rural town, away from any major city... I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger. I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me. I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you... I deserve that. Anyway, I've... I've only just realized I know that I've been... unwell. I know it's been like there's two sides to me. Because... I'm Tyler Durden. Absolutely, you have every right. I need you to do me a favor. Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds. Marla... I need to talk to you. It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out. I'm sorry, I... Marla... Marla, no, wait... Say my name! What's my name!? Say my name. What did you say... ? We've just lost cabin pressure. Answer the question! We did make love? Will you just answer me, for Christsake?! Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?" Marla, it's me. Have we... have we ever had sex? He's not here! Tyler's not here anymore! He's gone away! He's not here. The Paper Street Soap Company. Let go of me... Leave me alone. Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?! ... A person. No. That... sawing and hammering. You hear that? I don't understand. Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto? I don't know. When? Really... I mean it. Have you been going to your groups? You... don't have to... leave. Uh ... nah. I think everything's okay here. No... no problem. Nothing. Okay. Okay, I'm sure. No. Here. There? Where? Here? No, thanks. This is a sweet side of you. Picking these up for ... "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they? She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book. I don't know ... What are you talking about? Goodbye. It's time for you to leave. It suits you. Worth every penny. Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room. What the hell are you doing here? What are you doing here? So you're staying in tonight? This could go on for hours. Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment. I'm just on my way out... Look, this is a bad time... It's for men. I found a new one. That's the idea -- we split them. How did you find me? Marla? In case we want to switch nights. Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers? Let's not make a big thing out of it. We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month. The girl had done her homework. Then, take blood parasites. It's yours. Now we each have three. You can't have the whole brain! Okay. I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia -- You can't have both parasites. You can take blood parasites -- You're kidding. I think testicular cancer should be no contest. We'll split up the week. You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and -- Please. Can't we do something... ? Look, I can't cry with a faker present. It becomes an addiction. Yeah. I... I don't know. I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead... Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back. These are my groups. I was here first. I've been coming for a year. Why are you doing this? I'll expose you. Practicing what? Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying. But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying. I'm on to you. You're a faker. You aren't dying. We need to talk. ... and you come home to this. Well... let me see... here's the thing... I just called a second ago. There was no answer. I'm at a payphone. Uh... I'm sorry. We met on the plane. We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy. Tyler? Hello? Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position. Who do you think I am? What? Yes... it's a test. ... You know me? I had everything in that bag. My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes... My suitcase was vibrating? Excuse me? "Throwers?" You're a tourist. I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer. If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla. Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't. -- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive. They never said "parasite;" they said "agent." They always talked about getting better. I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around. My eyes are open. Look at me... Appreciate something. Do something for me. It's the only way to get rid of you... Not my mouth. Our mouth. What have you left for me? I swear on my life, I won't... Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler. Why are you doing this?! ... no, no, no... Noooo, please... No, no, I don't. I thank you, I really do. Thank you, but I don't need you anymore. Why can't I get rid of you? Why can't I just wish you away? Why... why... why... ? How'd you do that?! You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state... NO... Not exactly according to plan. Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin. I saw it floating in the bomb. Paraffin. Please... Can't you call it off... ? i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin... I think this is about where we came in. Yes. Defuse the bomb, please. Defuse the bomb. Tyler... I quit. Fuck your struggle. I want out. Bob is dead, Tyler. The police blew a hole in his head. Was that part of your plan? Fuck you. Yes... I'm pulling the green wire. If I'm wrong, we're both dead.. If you know, I know. You don't know that. There could still be people inside. Since when is Project Mayhem about murder? Stop finishing... I'm not going... I'm going to... I can't let you... You... you can't be serious about this. She's... you... you're fucking her. What about Marla? You have jobs. You took me to the house. Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat? No! This isn't true. We... we were around other people, together, both of us... What... what are you saying? This isn't possible... Oh, yeah. I didn't really know my Dad... He's not here! Tyler's not here anymore! He's gone away! The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club. What are you talking about... ? What... ? I don't know! Tell me! Answer me, Tyler. Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden? Why do people think I'm you? What's this all about, Tyler? "Training?" Tyler... "Applicant?" "Too young?" Wait a minute... ... is over. This conversation... Nothing. What? Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck you and fuck Marla. I'm sick of this. How's that? I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?! I don't know! Nothing! I don't think that's true. I'm not asking you to. What the hell ... ?! Tyler... What are you doing?! I want to know -- Look... You know what I mean. Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together. Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?" No. I felt like destroying something beautiful. Hey. I feel sick. Tell him! Tyler... What is it? What are we doing? I thought you did. Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week. There's fight club in Delaware City. Okay, and... and... Six months advance pay. Six months! What... ? Work. Going to work. You quit? ... Marla ... ? We don't... ? It isn't... ? I don't know... No, I'm not... I... I think I understand. I think I get it... I was going to my cave to find my power animal. Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this. Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand. Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts. What is this place? You get rid of her. Shhhhhh! I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't... Huh? Uh... nah... I said I promise! Yes, I promise. Okay. What? She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home. Marla doesn't need a lover. She needs a case worker. Oh, and my pace is more librarians. I'm fine. Yeah, I'm sure. No. Not at all. He was obviously able to handle it. You? Okay... Ghandi. Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails. Shatner. William Shatner. Doesn't matter. If you could fight any celebrity? A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood. Show-off. What are you reading? "I am Joe's Lungs." It's written in first person. "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells." There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate." What? The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in. I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year. Where's your car? Same here. I know that. Oh, yeah. I didn't know my dad. Well, I knew him, till I was six. He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family. My boss, probably. Who would you fight? Anyone? What fight? Call what off? Is it? Strange. Shit. Sorry. That didn't count. Where do you want it? In the face? This is crazy. Me? No. That's a good thing, isn't it? I don't know about this. You get the idea. He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well... He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry. Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work. No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did. In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution... It affords him other interesting opportunities. It's called a "changeover." The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea. What? What's that? Thank you. Can I stay at your place? Would that be a problem? No, I... Huh? I don't follow... Yeah. God, it's late. I should find a hotel... Don't I? Well, I have to file a claim... I don't... think so. What list? Insurance'll cover it. Delivered from Martha Stewart. Delivered from Swedish furniture. ...no ...no ... There's always that. All gone. I guess so. You buy furniture. You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need. No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled. Then, the right set of dishes. The right dinette. Well, uh... great. What? Thank you. You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained-- I mean -- for a living. What do you do, Tyler? No, supply oxygen? This is how I met -- Pardon me? Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer. We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction. The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin. In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble. I know this because Tyler knows this. That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way. ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin... Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?! Abort the plan. Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed... Excuse me? Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible... Who is this? No! Robert Paulson is dead. He's dead, because of you... No! Wrong! This man's name is Robert Paulson. No, no. This is a man -- this man has a name... What he wanted? Look... look at him. Look at him! What does he want? This is a person. This is not a cog in your machine...Tell the other person how you feel. Now, find your power animal. Okay, everyone. ...And you open the door and you step inside. We're inside our hearts. Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light. That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light. Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...No, please, no, God, no! Too much school. Yeah ... animals and s-s-s --- I... I don't know... Biology, mostly. S-S-Stuff. Please, God, no... Yesssss... How'd you know?His name is Robert Paulson! Robert Paulson? But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names. But, this is Project Mayhem. It's what he would have wanted, sir.Yeah, uh huh... yeah? Oh... Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor. But, every once in a while ... ...it's a dildo. It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo. We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo." Never "Your dildo." Baggage handlers. But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police. Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.What? What? What? Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy? Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth? What are you doing? You will. You know you will. If I leave, you will be right back where I found you... I'm doing this for us. No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together. From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart... Look, I can be selfish, I know that. I'm not blind to my own failings... You need me. Why what? Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination. Proceed with remote detonation. Do we have to do everything ourselves?! Damn it! God-damn it... What? What the fuck -- ? Fifteen seconds now. Can you see alright? 10... 9... 8.... It's out of our hands. This is it. This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion. One minute. Defuse the bomb? Ask me nicely. What? Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons. You need to get with the program. Seven minutes. Let's get out of here. You want out? Bob was a grown man. In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name? Project "Mayhem." I've got everything. The bombs. The army. I've got Marla. I'm serious. That's the wrong one. Don't pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire. Green? Did you say green? This is not about martyrdom. I wouldn't be doing that. Unless you know which wires, in what order... The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned. What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants? We both use that body. ...your sentences! They're our sentences. Get your mind around that. ...to let this happen! ...stop me? ...go through with this? What are you going to do? What a ridiculous thing to say. You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be... Um, well... technically, no. What about Marla? Night jobs -- while you were sleeping. The house is rented in your name. What about them? They're lunatics. You never talked to me in front of anyone else. It's okay. We okay... a little codependent, sure, but... We're going to have to do something about Marla... There! Happy? I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise. Now look what you've done! But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you... You can see me and hear me, but no one else can... And, sometimes you control it... Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me... Is this really news to you? People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body. Why do people think anything? Why did you do that? You broke your promise. You talked to her about me. And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South. Four in Milwaukee. If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training. If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat. You're too young. Sorry. ... is over. What are you talking about? Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat! It's not a seminar! You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me. Why do you think I blew up your condo? I want to hear the truth. If you died right now, how would you feel about your life? You're asking questions that don't have answers. You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else. You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you. We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. We are all part of the same compost heap... This does not belong to us. We are not the leaders. We are not special. What do you want to know about Project Mayhem? Should I E-mail you? Should I put this on your "action item list?" What do you want? A statement of purpose... ? Is this a needlepoint club? Is it about you and me? Fight club was the beginning. Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem. What should I have told you? Something on your mind? Where did you go, Psycho-Boy? Hey. Imagine how he feels. I asked you what you studied. An expired community college student ID card. What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel? Homework assignment. Newcastle? Did you start that one? I heard. Local 15, Monday nights. Fucking sweet. Nothing. Do what you like. Yeah. Where you headed? No thanks, I quit. Fuck damnation. Fuck redemption. We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it. We don't need him... Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you. In all probability, He hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen... Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God. And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God? This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it. No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment. Stop it. This is your pain -- your burning hand. It's right here. Look at it. Look at your hand. This clear layer in glycerin. We'll mix it back in when we make the soap. As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface. Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts. A liposuction clinic. Don't mention me. "The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception." You want to finish her off? That was three times you promised. Promise? Promise you won't. If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out. And you'll never see me again. Promise me. You've gotta understand something about me. I have a little rule, okay? Don't ever talk to her about me. Ever. I can't stand that kind of shit. Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute... She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport-fucking. Hey... don't knock librarians. She is a wild, twisted bitch. Stay away from that one. You're okay with this? Good. This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that... You're sure? I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ? Unbelievable, huh? Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger. Good answer. Any historical figure. Hemingway. You? Alive or dead? Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New Republic. "I get cancer, and I kill Joe." Oh, a new riot control grenade... "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..." Hum. What car? A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need. After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?" He said, "Get a job." When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?" He said, "I don't know. Get married." He was setting up franchises. My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go. My dad. No question. Anyone. If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight? This fight, pussy. The fight. We've crossed the threshold. You want to call it off? But a good strange. How do you feel? Like hell. That counted. Surprise me. Alright, go crazy. Let 'er rip. Why not you? I'm letting you go first. Do it. I don't want to die without any scars. How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked. I don't know, either. I want to find out. I've never been hit, have you? Go ahead. Say it. ... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Don't watch. I can't if you watch. A nice, big cock. One-forty-eighth of a second. That's how long it's up there. -- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films. Why would anyone want this shitty job? They're called "cigarette burns." I want you to hit me as hard as you can. I want you to hit me as hard as you can. You're welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor. Yes, you can. Is it a problem for you to ask? Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place? You called me so you could have a place to stay. We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me. So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel? A hotel? Do what you like. The things you own, they end up owning you. This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks. The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list. That list. Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list. Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia." Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns. But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered. I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit. The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right? I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy. Could be worse. A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car. And, now it's gone. This is how we fill up our lives. Keep it up, then. Keep it right up. Being clever. How's that working out for you? The spork. I get it. You're very clever. Why? So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it? What do you want me to do? Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths... You know why they have oxygen masks on planes? Tyler Durden. Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola. Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick. Look what we've accomplised. Thirty seconds. It's getting exciting now. One minute. This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion. Thank you. Thank you, sir... We need some towels, Lou. We need replacement light bulbs. Pleeeeeease! You and your friend. You're welcome to join our club. Yes, it is. It's free to all. There is no money. We have a deal worked out with Irvine. Would you rather be dead? Stuff. That means you have to get more schooling. Animals. What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel? Why? "Stuff." Were the mid-terms hard? Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face. Is this a picture of Mom and Dad? They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers. Raymond, you're going to die. Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A. A small, cramped basement apartment.Well, sir, you said you might. You told me you'd say that, too. You told me you'd say that. Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid. Very good, Sir. Maintenance.You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir. Tyler Durden. Is this part of the test? You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum. You were in here last Thursday night. Is this a test, sir? How have you been?
