What? Really? Maybe. Don't go home, okay? I wish I were somewhere else. She came a long way to visit me, didn't she? What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody? You do? You believe now? Just help. No. You have nice red in your cheeks now. You really look better. What happened? We're not gonna start crying again, are we? Are you wigging out? Something happened, didn't it? You believe me, right? Dr. Crowe? You weren't a paper champion. Don't cry. Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it. Don't fail me. When? Why don't you think about it for a while? I told you what I want. What do you want more than anything? Can I ask you then? When they get mad, it gets cold. And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up? Cats? Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time. Did you think the play sucked big time? Will you stay here till I fall asleep? All the time. They're everywhere. You won't tell anyone my secret, right? No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead. Me too. Your eyes told me. You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas. You haven't told bedtime stories before? Dr. Crowe. Yes. I didn't know you were funny. You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time... That isn't magic. Something I want? Upset words. Words. What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it? She died a long time ago. Mr. Marschal gets real lonely. You said the "s" word. That I'm a freak. Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know. I don't tell her a thing. He hates me. I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo. Look over there. Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her. Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism. You want to ask me a question? I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows. They don't have meetings about rainbows. Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying. I don't draw like that anymore. We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver. Next time I won't be scared of you. I'm going to see you again, right? That's good. Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt? You use needles? Congratulations. You're a doctor. What kind? I forgot your name. Nothing bad can happen in a church, right? What were they hiding from? No, just one. ...De profundis clamo ad te domine. They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes. She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance. She wanted me to tell you-- I know. Grandma comes to visit me sometimes. She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot. Got it. You think I'm a freak? What are you thinking, Momma? They want me to do things for them. Ghosts. Dead people. They scare me too sometimes. Standing next to my window. Yes. A lady. She died. Someone got hurt. You know that accident up there? Tell you my secrets. I'm ready to communicate with you now. Maybe. Don't get mad. Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved. You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much. Anything bad about me? What are you thinking, Momma? Oh. Stuttering-- Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley! Stop looking at me. You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad. You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school! You're a stuttering Stanley! Stop it! I don't like people looking at me like that. They were the ones who hanged everybody. They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them. They used to hang people here.Goodnight, sweetheart. I just needed to do a couple of things. And I needed to tell you something. I didn't leave you. What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad? Are you calling me? --Do I know you? We can keep it in the bathroom. Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss? Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom. Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time. And you know what else? You were great in the play, Cole. I think we said everything we needed to say. Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you? I definitely won't. Where will you go, where no one has died? I guess she did. I don't think that's the way it works, Cole. I believe both of you now. And I think I might know how to make them go away. Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones... What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole... It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.' Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal? Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is? Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone... No, we're not. Yes, I am. Yes, it did. Yes. Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy. It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was... I was a fake. --What? I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional-- Soon. One week. I have to. I don't know, Cole. I don't know. Yes. Them? Yes? Never mind. I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk. I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats. What? ...No. How often do you see them? They don't know they're dead? Dead people, like in graves and coffins? I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending. What makes you think that? No gas... Hey, that's good. No. Yes. Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep... When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on-- Your father ever tell you bedtime stories? I forgot myself. Who me? What? If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be? Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be? What kind of words? What'd you write? I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing. ...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth. What about Mrs. Marschal? Yeah. Sorry. Know what? Why? You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy? You hate him? He your best buddy? Where should I look then, Cole? You mean aneurysm. See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question. I guess they don't. How do you draw now? You saw that on T.V., Cole? And Cole, next time I won't be late for you. If it's okay with you? No. No. Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while. You're my very first client back. I got an award once. From the Mayor. I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out. Dr. Crowe. Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them. All your soldiers speak Latin? What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun. I knew there was a sound explanation. Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.Thanks. Okay. Fine. Understood. I'm off then. Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem. On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak! S-ssssstop it! S-ssstop that! Who! How did you--? What-- Excuse me? I don't know how else to look-- Like what? Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers. That's not correct. Where'd you hear that? Yes, Cole?
