Can you come out now, Mommy? Please? Mommy, Nick broke my crayon! Well, Lexi hit me and he almost  broke... he almost broke my ear! I'm sorry, M'am. We have orders to  deliver these. Mommy, which box has our toys? Just wrap. You're not Picasso. Picasso would probably put the bows  on the back of the box. Hello, Roberta. I did. I'm in town for my Mom's  birthday. No -- that's her gift. It looks very pretty. That's O.K. My parents didn't read  it either. It looks good on their  coffee table, though. So what are you doing here? I thought  you'd be in Carnegie Hall by now. I'll bet you're a great teacher. Your husband ran off with your best  friend. So you're just gonna wrap presents  and wait for him to come back? That's not very sexy. A little of both. You know, I know this really cool  lady who runs this elementary school --  I wrote a piece on her. It's a public  school, but it's alternative -- she  might be able to create some kind of  gig for you. Let me give her a call. If she hires you, though, you have  to be willing to relocate. Welcome to East Harlem. Are we having a talent show? I should  have brought my tap shoes. Since I was three. She's O.K. Assuming they had the discipline. I think I know these students, Miss  Demetras. Their attention span doesn't  go past do-re-mi. Maybe on a good  day, I can get them to "fa." That I'd like to see. Well, I've already planned out the  whole term, and I can tell you right  now, there's no room for this!  Besides, where you gonna find money  for violins? Yeah. I don't wanna learn no stupid violin.  It's for wimps. I just know. De Sean. Hey, I play pretty good. Naeem. It's a toast. To Roberta, who's made it through  her first week. Look at the progress. Didn't you say  no one was listening to you on Monday? There's no rush. Thank you. I follow my gut, pay attention to  what I'm being drawn to... I've been waiting to do that since  Mr. Baines' orchestra class. Sure I did. You used to ignore me  and it drove me wild. It didn't mean I had the one I wanted. You're not a navy wife anymore... And is it a navy requirement that  you dress like it's the 1950's? Who did you vote for in the last  election? Tell me. Oh my God -- it's even worse than I  thought! Is this the same Roberta who got the  orchestra to strike until they gave  us new uniforms? I don't believe that. Because? They're sleeping. And what's your husband doing right  now? They're still sleeping. Texas. Farm workers. I just got the call --  it came through -- my research grant!  It came through! Isn't that great? I've got a few families lined up  there, some in California -- Two, three months. Whoa. Roberta -- last night was great  but did you think I was gonna marry  you in the morning? You're gonna be fine. You have a  job, a place to stay, your kids have  a school to go to -- and there's a  D'Agostino's around the corner. Tightening the horse hair. Yeah? I don't know. I wasn't here. It's called the frog. C-C-C-C, D-D-D-D, E-E-E-E... No talking! Miss Cooper's students have phys ed  on Tuesdays. You must have read the schedule wrong. Well, I can't solve this problem for  you right now. I'm trying to teach. Daddy said we could get one when we  moved back to America. When's Daddy coming back? No! Leave it on. I can't be in violin class anymore. My mother won't let me. Please, Mom? Can't I be in the class? What'd I do? You're under arrest. Hello, Bobbi. I'm back in the States. I'm at my  parents. No. Bobbi -- stop, O.K.? Just stop. I want a divorce. It is. It's over between us too, Bobbi. I can't believe you were still holding  out hope. The guy hasn't called you  or the kids in three months -- I  thought you'd moved on. No? Maybe not with words. No, no -- I'm sorry. Look, I know it  hurts, but you're gonna get through  this, Roberta -- you will. What? You're gonna quit teaching in  the middle of the term? What are you gonna tell Janet --  your husband left you and nothing  else matters? My mother gave it to me. To buy breakfast. I didn't! In Greece, we could see the ocean.  Remember? And the octopuses. Is Daddy coming here soon? Can you tell the birthday story? I want to hear the birthday story. But you knew I'd be born that day. And Daddy laughed. He didn't believe you. But I was  born. The same day as Grandpa. Was Daddy happy too? Then why is he leaving me? Then why can't he live here? My asthma -- it was very bad and I  had to go to the hospital. Oh yeah. Maybe it was last week. Hi, Roberta. Yeah, I can. It wasn't? I thought we stunk. Why you acting like that? Nice. I already got nice teachers. You  added some variety. I'll take good care of them. Santa Claus. I'm back. You trying to kill me? Lawrence. Hey, your daughter does what she  wants -- or haven't you noticed? Man. We'll never get that right. I'm sorry. It's just... Why do people feel like the minute  something's going great, they gotta  name it? Once you name something, you snuff  the life out of it. Well, maybe if you'd actually gone  through the Sixties, you'd know what  I'm talking about. I'm sorry. I'm being an asshole. You can say you love me if you want. Well, if I could just remember what  I did here yesterday, I'd be moving  a whole lot faster. You look real pretty today, honey. You're crazy. Why did you hire him? When? Fifty years ago? That's how it comes. Yep, that's how it comes now. What the hell is this? You've gotta be kidding. Those ex- cons you hired ripped this off --  and you too! Fine. Do it your way. It's my house! They don't live here --  I do! I don't feel like it. Good catch Nick! Uh-oh. You know what that means? Don't! Don't throw me in! Whatsa matter? Afraid of a little  water? The ducks aren't afraid! Are  you a chicken or a duck? Don't! Don't throw me! Looks like you got yourself a chicken,  Roberta! I'm not a chicken! Well then you must be a duck! He misses his dad. I'm just a  surrogate. Whoa. Can we just slow down here a  minute? It's too much like getting  married. That kind of commitment just isn't  realistic. I mean, how can we know  that you and I will even be able to  stand each other in five years? And look what happened to you and  Charles. Look, Roberta. Marriage is based on  a belief that one person can  completely meet another person's  needs. I just don't buy that. I'm saying that it's the 80's and  it's a fantasy to think of marriage  lasting these days. One out of two  marriages ends in divorce! In theory, yes. Roberta, we've got something good  right now -- that's the important  thing. Let's just keep it that way, Why can't he? Well then I wanna go to his house. I don't feel like practicing. I wanna go to Brian's! The problem with you is you're mean  to everybody and then they don't  want to be with you! I hate the violin! It's all your fault! You made Daddy  leave and you're gonna make Brian  leave too! You're gonna be all alone  and I'll have to take care of you! Then who's going to? You didn't try hard enough. You made  Daddy leave us. Why not? Who? Is he gonna marry her now? White. Eggshells are white. You're an idiot! I told you -- you  can't be your own contractor. That's more like it. Roberta -- Janet and I started this program  because we knew how much you kids  could benefit from it. You should know, however, that the  violin is a difficult instrument. Who's that lady in the back? Say what? What kinda name is that? I wanna be in the magazine! I really really hope that I get in  the class. No. I'm done. What -- are you timing me with a  stop watch? Why don't you pick on  Lexi for a change? Can I try your bike? Just wanna take it for a spin. C'mon, Henry -- he don't want to  loan you his bike. I didn't hear him say that. Is that true? Did you say that? C'mon, Mom -- why don't you let me  handle this? It's the next block up. I'll help him, O.K.? We'll both pay  you back. O.K., slow down. It's the second one  on the right. C'mon Mom, let's get out of here. I'm coming with you! Don't take the stairs! You think he actually cares that  you're a teacher? You think he even  goes to school? I was just borrowing it. It's too hard! I don't wanna do it! I don't want to! This is to inform you that your child,  Ramon Olivas, has been chosen by  lottery to be in the violin program. It's coming. Look, it's just not cool. You wouldn't  understand. I've been busy! I've been -- Why didn't you show it to me? Well, I'm his parent and I don't  give permission! He should be playing  baseball, not the violin! Ooh, check out little Miss Violinhead. Ramon! How many cats you killing in  there? Drop dead, Justin! It was a accident! Was not! She's going back and forth between  houses. My wife and I split up. You wanna hear my new song, Papa? Not right now. You go to heaven... You go to hell...  You go to hell... heaven... My grandpa died and my uncle, so  that makes six. There was a drive-by shooting by his  house and he got shot on accident  and he died. I think we should just play violin. Did that sound O.K.? Yeah. You got very strict with him. You think Justin's in heaven or hell? I told him to drop dead. How do you know? Yeah. I'd be better than you! Not for a man. We were just trying to help! Mom, no one knows it's you! I mean,  you don't even have to read them if  you don't want to. Although obviously, a lot of guys  are interested in dating you. "Beautiful musician, late 40's, tired  of playing solo -- My violin playing will feed your  soul... Don't you think it's a little weird  that you're not even interested in  dating? I'm not flat. Just play the violin, Mom. I'll take  care of the cello. Hi. I'm Dan Paxton. Wow. An honest woman. Your ad. When you said you were  beautiful, you were telling the truth. Make sure you're home by midnight,  young lady. That's a no-brainer. Of course he'll  try. The real question is whether  she'll let him. You're on. I had a lot of fun tonight. I have a confession -- I've never  answered an ad before. I did it on a  dare. Does this mean I don't get any  lasagna? Why? Is it late? "Nice"? As in "let's just be friends"  nice? There's still a lot more letters. We heard you got fired. I'm tenured, Roberta. Why not? You're a sub. Your position  has never been permanent. What happened? It's the wrong analogy. You couldn't  do anything about Grandpa's death.  It was irreversible. This isn't. Let me ask you something. Why did  you risk your life for a bicycle? Of course you did! That building?  Threatening Henry? And for what --  two hundred dollars? Simon's our third child to study  with Roberta. James is pre-med,  April's valedictorian -- now that  says something! I think we should inundate the Board  and the District with letters. Take your pick. Who authorized this? Well Janet's not here today and I  want these people out of here. Turn that off, you hear me? You're disrupting school and I want  them out of here -- now. Get these people out of here or I'm  calling the police. I don't hear no sirens. How does it make you feel to lose  your violin program? Yeah, like we're never gonna have no  more violin lessons -- Didn't we send them a donation? Involved how? Uh-oh. Bach's "Minuet One"? Every Saturday and Sunday? Take it from me -- this lady don't  lie. Y'all are gonna work your butts  off. Hey Carlos! Where ya goin'? We got a  game, remember? Yeah, I know, but... I can't make  it. What you talkin' about? I just can't make it. You got a date with the violin  teacher? Yeah. I do. How can we practice? We're rehearsing  all the time. Am I hearing right? Did you use the  words "give up"? Let's take a vote. How many of you  want to give up? There's nothing. Why don't you just do it in one of  the schools? It'll be a lot smaller  but -- Incredible sound in this room, no? You must be Roberta. Would you believe in 1960, they tried  to tear this place down? They wanted  to replace it with a bright red  skyscraper -- we called it "the red  terror." We had to fight like hell, but with  a lot of help, we saved Carnegie  Hall. If it's all right with you, I'd like  to play in your concert. Maybe bring  a couple of friends... Don't give up. That's fantastic! And "the world's greatest violinists"  are playing side by side with you  because they want to help you win  this fight. But you do have a gift. You're gonna  put thirty East Harlem kids on stage  at Carnegie Hall not because they're  prodigies, but because you got them  to stick with something that's hard  as hell and to strive for excellence --  which, by the way, I certainly wasn't  striving for when I was their age.  Not to mention the other ten years'  worth of students whose lives were  changed because of you. That's your  talent, Roberta. I know. And by the way, I happen to think  you're a pretty good violinist too. I've heard enough to know you're  gonna do just fine. Besides, no one's gonna be paying  attention to your playing anyway. Teacher's late. I think she should  be dropped, don't you? Yeah. I don't think we should let  her play in Fiddlefest! More bow! To the frog! You sound  terrible! I can't believe how terrible  you sound! You're gonna make everyone in Carnegie  Hall sick to their stomachs! That's  right, they're gonna pay a thousand  dollars a ticket and you're gonna  make them throw up on their gowns  and tuxedos! No, that's O.K. You can take it from  here. And we'll get the Bach Double. We  will. It's gonna be O.K., Roberta. Yes, Mom. You've already got two -- how many  emergencies can there be? What are you doing? You're insane, you know that? Finish getting dressed! Congratulations. I knew you'd get here sooner or later.  I'm glad I'm here to see it. A pleasure to meet you, Guadalupe. You nervous, Mr. Perlman? Should I be? Us kids are gonna be great -- I don't  know about you guys. How much did  you practice? Half hour call! It's now half hour  call! So pace yourself accordingly.  Don't get more than thirty minutes  worth of nervous! With the violin. Done. You're glowing. FIVE MINUTE CALL. WE NOW HAVE FIVE Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Arnold  Steinhardt, Diane Monroe, Michael  Tree, Mark O'Connor and Karen Briggs. The frog hair? It's horsehair!
