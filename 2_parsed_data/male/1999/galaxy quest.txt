Don't speak, Quellek. No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up. Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine. Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified. Open. Come with me. I'll explain on the way. Quellek. What are you doing in there? Uh uh! What did we talk about? Thanks. Is that the bathroom? Where's my bed? This is it? Just don't. Don't do that. I'm not kidding. Well good, that's very... nice. Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to... Yes. Good was done this ..... Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight... "Purple skinned monstrosity...?" Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch! That's your problem. You were never serious about the caraft... "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this? Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT. VIBRATIONS. Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..." ... . Well you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation? Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it Nothing. Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly- Go ahead! Must be some sort of mining facility. THIS much. About this much. DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP! You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts We've got to stop! Like throwing gasoline on a fire... "Just!?" God, what an ass. ... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking... ...Damn you! Damn you! I won't and nothing you say- Friend. You stole all my best lines. You cut me out of episode two entirely!.. As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.' This is ludicrous. Why are you listening to this man? Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?... He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow. No offense. And note the sucked in gut. You think you could do better "Laredo?" Shut up. What's happened? Could you possibly try not to hit every single one! He wants to THINK!? Jason, what have you gotten us into? No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't. I can't! I played Richard III... He's a twit! By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. Yes you did. Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals." You said "the Commander. He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he? It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures... Nobody was WATCHING? Could they be the miners? To see if there's a pub. "Go into the cloud! ... WE'VE HAVE TO STOP! May I get the check? We heard it the first time! Oh my god, It's real. Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring. A boy comes to the door. I still haven't got this bloody thing off. Oh good, there's nothing to eat. Oh can't I? Watch me! Dear God.... How did I come to this? He's a miserable twit!We'd better get everybody online. And Kyle, Stop downloading porn. Your frame rate is unacceptable. You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right? No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads. He probably... Has some very important business to attend to... Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat. Raise the glass and push the blue button. Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you. Up. Go. They're off again. GO Commander. Lt. Madison, GO. Wait two seconds then go. Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom... Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit. My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman. He's seen it 13 times... No, I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past. It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds. Well, that's the big question, isn't it? Yes Commander? Okay, that's where you want to be. Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left. Commander, do you have a camera? I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing. Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility. The bowels of the ship. Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units. Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent... Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive. I knew it!... I KNEW it!... ... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a- Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but... Brandon. Oh... Oh, I see. Oh. ... Yes? Yes but, we were wondering- Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies? Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-Systems register functional. Systems register functional. Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard. Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced. The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress. The enemy is matching velocity. The ship is sustaining structural damage. There is no weather in space. Yes? Structural damage at 68 percent.OK! Covalent... Right. So... ... What does that mean? U.... What do you think? As good as Hopkins? You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins. No, I'll kill you. . Right. No, no... I'll think on it... A hologram... Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think? Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that? It's suicide. We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone... ...The digital conveyor. You Okay, Alex? Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.I'm just a glorified extra, Fred. I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward. Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this... may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape. Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor! I don't like this... I don't like this at all... How do you remember this stuff? We're doing episode 31, Jason? I am SO SICK of being right. Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!... Something BAD happened here. Do I? DO I? For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"! Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY? The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?... It's ... incredible. "Crewman #6"... Call me Guy. Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know. We~re oetting hammered, Jason. Return fIre? I know... You contruct a weapon. Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?... BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31! Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not? That's it, that's what's going to kill me. We're screwed... We're so screwed... No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me? Yeah, what is it? Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name? They're still behind us... ...Okay ~e're alive! We're alive! Not a clue. You? Where'd they go? Back inside? We're doing episode 31? More to the left... Stay parallel... Guy... You probably don't remember me do you? I was on the show in '82. Episode 31? Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial? "Crewman #6?" Hi everybody.No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets- Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo- ~hex! Alex, are you oKav? I had the shot... I was staying in character. "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?" Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity, Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there? It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation! ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me! KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!... I heard something. A squeal. What? What? You go first! There's no time! There it is. The Beryllium sphere. What's the scale? Is that ten miles? A hundred miles? KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING! NO! WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH! Like YOU know? We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy! At ease men. Calm down everybody. We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender. COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR... Leadership.... I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty... "The show must go on." You WILL go out there. Come on, old friend... That's It? I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do? What? Up? Shit! Go! No, wait, are you- Okay, now. But- BRANDON! TIME TO GO! How did you come to that conclusion? But you don't? What do you mean? What does the Omega 13 do? Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know... Yes...? We'd never have the budget for this. Okay... Okay, now what. Okay, we got it. Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help. It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real. It's okay. Listen- Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you... What's your name, son? We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday. There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship Do you get it? It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand? Excuse me guys. Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred. Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this. Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls.. I'll take my chances with Gorignak. The digital conveyer? You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces? Never mind, Fred.... I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely. No. Keep all energy to the armor. A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.' It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?! It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion. Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we? All right, let's all settle down. If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control. It's... I don't know. Your last name. Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay? We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?... All right. Put me back on with him. TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT! Mark 12. Because it was on the show! Gwen... There's no hatch. There's no hatch! No I don't. But I know somebody who does. Right. What the hell are you talking about? Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard? What? What did he say? Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though... Yes. Yes, I'm here! Will you stop RIDING ME?! It helps. All right... here's the plan: First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere. Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter. Don't be ridiculous. Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me? Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard? Can it be repaired? Are they behind us? Maybe we can lose them in that cloud. Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying... I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.' You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay? We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right? All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly. Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here. Let me think. I need time to think. Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no! Hey... Hey where are you going? It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF... The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it. Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them. Tell them? About... C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck. But I'm the Commander! Let me try. Computer? Computer?... Oh come on, it's not like I haven't- It's Jason... This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?... You smiled at me. What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander. A few fans built a little set in their garage. . I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing. Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy. We.. We lie. We pretend... My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors. Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it. Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything. No! I swear I don't know! Please! Stop, please! I don't know! I don't know. Yes. All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now. Just give me a moment to set it up. Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even... Right. Well... Listen, I'm I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding. I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh... ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that. Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing? Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer. You can oc that? It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain. Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations. It's all a fake. I'm not him... I'm a nothing. A nobody. A model, only as big as this. I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip. Well... Sort of... You what?.. What are you talking about? Mathesar? What is that? Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew. Former Commander? Then how did he find out about the device? Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records? Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender! It's perfectly safe. I promise. It was a lot of fun. You kids are great. Thanks I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00. But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call... Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels. Long live Theramini. Take a left here? Right. Long live... What's your planet? Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids. Home. Mind If we skip that? I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys. Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on. Catch me later, okay? Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these Hold course, Laredo! Mark 20 Into the black hole, areao. Let's do it, Tommy. Pedal to the metal Tommy... Practice driving, Tommy. All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on. Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time. We've got to get out of here. C'mon, hurry It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots! It doesn't have eyes. Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard. Okay... On what? Good work, Tommy. Let's go! Okay, let's go. Tommy, we have these... Anything. All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me. Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back. Do your best, Tommy... Push It. Hold it down. Faster Tommy. Get us out of here! Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO! Well, it's... This was a device we... discovered on an alien planet. We don't know what it does either. They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant... I think we're going to exit the space port. Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector. I can show you on a map. That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps. And determination. I didn't say that. I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.I have sectors 1-28.

Inside, I have seen- But there it is!... We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost. But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris. "Deception..." "Lies." We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship... A thousand apologies. We have failed you. It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185. Commander... I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown. Our former Commander was not... Strong. NO, Thank God he has not. To our brave guests. Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes. We are blessed to count ourselves among them. ... Maintenance facility... Weapons storage... How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people. An interstellar vox. He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of- But what if Sarris survives? Theramin. But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him. You... You mean Earth? Commander?... Where are you... going? As you wish. Commander... Welcome to the Protector II. Would you like to don your uniform? Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula. Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death... Please Captain, you are our last hope. We have secured a limousine. I... certainly, but- Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes! What does that mean?!!! Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!... That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me. ... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you. LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning. I have been blessed. Sir, I... I... I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir... I'm... I'm shot. Sir! The pressure. It's normalizing. I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze. Where is everyone? Sir, it's you Thank Ipthar! Right... Sorry, sir. Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you- Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper. I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density. Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy. Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible... Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless. ...Yes sir. Your quarters sir. I'm sorry, sir, I was only- By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I- Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.This is embarrassing, really. I shan't tell this story when I return home. Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?... Simpler. Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists. Explain - Wait. What did you say? Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship? Prepare a tear harness for the female... Is it a bomb? A booby trap? Tell me! Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13. You have ten seconds. Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship. Better than my Lieutenant. He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter. First, I require the Omega 13... Second- Fire at will. hI~D NT. PROTECTOR WHAT? WH Get oacK on their tail. Find them. Find them. Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain. Patience, Lt. . Patience.You have a better plan, Alex? ...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps... Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit. You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second. You were holding it upside down weren't you? The engines are dead. We're drifting. They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!... No, Jason, that's a wrap! There's nothing to think about! What the hell is going on?!!? Settle down, Alex... Not again... Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us? We made it. Commander, we made it.' We made It.

I can try. JASON You think you could-get any closer to those mines? I heard it too. That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough. Face it, he's dead. I can't... It's on autopilot!...
