Damn. Unbe-fucking-lievable. Oh, shit. ...shit. Oh... help me get in the truck. At least somebody likes this shit. Okay, okay. What, do you work for my boss, dog? That's right. you see, that was a-that was my mission. Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls. My code name was Blackjack. Night Shift was my coach. Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach. I was undercover as a tennis player. It all started with our mission in Istanbul. You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game. I feel faint. Oh! Bullshit, yeah. Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'. But he didn't. See, that's negotiation. ...-tiatin'. I was not in the man's face. I was nego-... Thank you very much. I think so too. I'll handle this from here, sweet Owes us a little restitution. ...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution. ...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country... Right. You damn skippy. And now that I am both jobless... Hello. ...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt? Who put the big hurt on... ...truck that kept Elvis cool? Who drove the ice cream... Always the negative... Stop limpin' around like that. Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey. We are heroes, my man. It's time to start actin' like it. We're the shit. Bigtime. You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel. Well. Why'd you stay behind?! Look out. Okay. Come on, big guy! Got it? Come on, darlin'. I gotcha. Go. Hang on, hang on. Sorry. Hold this. Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway! Can we get out on your end of the tunnel? Vitelli! Vitelli! What? What? All right It's melting, man. Mason. Forty-nine point four. Shoot me. Unbe-fucking-lievable. Stupid. What the--? What do you think I'm doin'?! Whoo! ...tunnel! ...here comes the... Okay... He's comin' up fast! ...they come! Here... We've got Elvis! We! Oh, shit. Okay.

They're takin' off. Hey! Are you all right? Bullshit. You would've killed us anyway. ...man. A-And you owe me... ...or my conscience. ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt... Even though it is nice to see Andy... ...deal with this asshole. I think you oughta cut a... Hey. Mason. All right, all right. Hey, hey. Yeah, baby! That is loud! I'm Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here. ...miles. Split? I wouldn't get ten... ...shit. ...Long. Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis... ...-er. It was your friend... ...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ... I mean, if that gun was... Not completely, anyway. To tell you the truth, you didn't. Well, shit. Could be worse. I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle. I remember him. Got in a car crash or somethin'. Robert Del Rio? How wonderful for you. You know. So I took his truck, yeah. Nobody's lookin' out for my interests. My credit was fucked! And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped. So I split. ...overdrawn bank accounts. ...just ready to just slide him right in there. And what about me, huh? What about Arlo, huh? What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans... ...or nephew or some good old boy... ...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it. But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin... And he swore, he swore once I got a degree... I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard. You know what I'm sayin'? ...piece of shit was worth. Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck. Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled... ...-tion? See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-... ...did you? Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out... Worth a try. Okay. This thing just went up a degree. Ice cream's not workin'. Uh-oh. Whoo-hoo-hoo! All right. Hey. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, shit! Okay. Okay. Oh, shit. What? Oh, shit. Okay. Come on. You're not dangerous! You're crazy! I ain't gettin' in this damn thing! You're--? What?! He's crazy! ...man! Yeah, he's a dangerous... ...you're dealin' with! ...to him! You don't know who... Listen! Listen... Okay. All right. Okay. ...yeah. Yeah... Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Oh, shit. It's okay. Okay. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. No. Shit. Oh, Pete. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go, go. Shit. ...shit! Oh... Shut up! Okay. That didn't work. Holy--! Gee, you think so? What the fuck was that?! What are you talkin' about?! I'm the one drivin'! Whoo! ...you crazy bastard. Come on... Come on. Come on. ...Pete. Come on. Come on, old... ...wanna give it a try! ...Night Shift, but you might... ...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim... I know the likeli-... Come on, old Pete. Oh. ...Pete! Come on. Oh, shit. Come on, old... Come on. I'm goin'. I'm goin', baby. I'm goin', I'm goin'. God, man! Come on, old Pete. Come on! Come on, old Pete. Hey, hey! Whoo! Okay. I should've had that dog bite me. I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse! Oh, Petey. Oh, Petey. Oh, please, Pete. Please don't do this to me. Okay. Okay. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us! Everybody dies! Hey, and what if we don't make it?! Eight and a half feet wide! Weighs over five tons! You think we can make what?! You see that truck?! You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! ...Shift. Oh, we're screwed, Night... ...is, old Pete! Come on, baby! ...Pete! Come on! There it... Come on, old... Oh, shit. Oh! Hey! Hey! Andy's Ice Cream. ...waiting! Well, then, that means it's call... ...truck! It was owed to me. You stole the damn... I did not steal the truck. ...let live. ...I believe in live and... And I'm a peaceful man, and... ...you. Every time I look at you, I wanna hit... ...-er! ...-cho and a hijack-... ...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift. You're psy-... Hey, take a look at your situation and... Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one. Kiss my ass! ...gun?! Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty... Okay. Okay! All right! Get him to stand up, Night Shift. Oh... Oh, shit. You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?! What? Take your gun! You're nuts, goin' back there! Okay. Okay, okay! We can't push old Pete in this heat. He can't take it. Hey. I ain't playin' that. I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man. I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me! Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula! I did not steal this truck! Yeah, borrowed! Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy. I ain't goin' through Missoula! To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula. No, no, no. ...-er. No, you gotta go to McGrud-... Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone. Oh, man. Do you wanna give me a minute? ...-ed. Damn diesel injections are flood-... ...all the time. It happens to this piece of shit... Damn. Are you kiddin'? I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna-- Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business. Man, I can talk all I want to. I'm gonna stomp your a-- That dog was mean before I met him. Yeah, to keep him off my ass. What the hell is with you, dog? He's the one with the damn gun. Would you hurry up, please? You are not takin' my truck! ...doing?! Hey, you're gonna piss me-- What the hell are you supposed to be... No. Peace. ...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. And if that Elvis shit... Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago. That shit will be worthless by noon. ...truck. You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my... ...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit! ...think he was a wacko. And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko. And I think you're the biggest wack-... Hey, listen! Do you know what I think? I... For cryin' out loud. ...ya? Wait, wait. You don't believe the dead guy, do... ...and a shitload of ice. No, no, no. You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck... Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off. What did I say? Sorry, man. He's dead. Aw! Oh, Jesus. No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait. Oh. Huh? That'll make up the difference, huh? ...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over the mountain. ...off. Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love... Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent... ...two things Andy is not. Uh, but I tell you what. ...and fair... He could've. That-That's true. But that would've been smart... Except for the fact that I need cash. Uh, huh? Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. Well, he told me to collect cash. Since today. New policy. Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars. And we need that in cash. Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick. No argument there. Great. Where do you want this stuff? Sam? Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind. ...-ty. ...yeah. Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-... Oh... Hey! Funny situation, ain't it, Andy? Well, well, well. Oh, my God. I don't ever wanna see another ice cream... ...frozen! So if you don't mind--! I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's... Listen, shithead! What'd he say? It's for you. I'll keep an eye out. That was quick. Be cool. Be-- Hey, be cool. Hey. ...help you? Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to... I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy. But I can tell you this. Takin' your truck pissed you off? It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five. Well, that just about figures for today. Hey, actually... So you called the damned thing Elvis ...take my sorry old truck. Wait. This town is full of trucks. Nice new trucks. You don't need to go... Yeah, that's my truck. ...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for! He's the dude... Listen, deputy. Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?! Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though. No, sir. I've never seen this guy before. I'd say we're about even. Exactly. Us. Owe us. Thank you. ...on ice! We've got Elvis on ice! We've got it... Are you crazy?! Take the boat?! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!Yes, sir. No, sir. They were all wearing hardware. Looks like it. Yes, sir. Colonel Vitelli. We got a busted-in cold vault inside.Vaughn. ...such is the price...of patriotism. But... And it won't be pleasant. Three seconds. One... ...without compunction. This country trained me to kill... I urge you to be persuasive. Your move. Okay, Vaughn, you drive. Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks. Don't be tedious, waiter. Dr. Long called it Elvis. ...within five minutes. Give it to me now, or you'll be dead... ...about him. We're worried... To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center. Maybe you know him. Richard Long. Forget about him. Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction... And let me guess. You failed. Almost quaint. "Went away." I like that. Went away? ...always done, Richard? What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've... ...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem. ...you were right, of course. But after... Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in? Well... Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone. Mm-hm. ...and the government. Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you. Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you... ...-ple. ...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-... You look fit...healthy... You look good, Richard. Is this stool taken? There's nothing to say, doctor. Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said. Damn you, Long! My people are out there! Your people are out there! All right. One more shot, provided... we're off the island tonight. ...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against. ...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar! And let me tell you something else. I didn't join the service to let people like you turn... ...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons, and we're... The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work... ...-bility. This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long. You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-... Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation? ...to be off the island tonight. What the hell is all this about a detonation today? We're scheduled... ...-tor Long. Doc-... I'll do it. And I'm warning you, Leo. Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die. ...Destry, Fair Oaks.... ...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper... Or I may be wrong. The breeze could be gusting south. That'd be Billings... Hm. The wind's northwest. That oughta be...Seattle. ...-enworth. I'll have no compunction at all about using this. ...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ... ...-ians. But I assure you, Leo... Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-... And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-... Pleasant surprise. Good to see you again, Leo. Well, Lieutenant Vitelli. ...happen if I drop this? Do you know what'll... Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis. They had a tactical withdrawal. It's just those two amateurs now. Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them? All right. Let's clear the mess and move out. Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street. Fan out and work your way back to the motel. Get 'em on line, then stall. Long can't have gotten far. Hit him again. Hit him. Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier. He'll be more useful now. Carl! Set up the camera. All right. Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour. Of which we have more than enough. And so Missoula's prodigal son returns. You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you? Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for. Radio the bikes. Well. It appears someone's been lying to us. ...comes up that road. Dennis, radio the bikes. I wanna know if so much as a squirrel... Move. This is already affecting our schedule. This is it. Stay put. Keep the camera trained on... Get 'em in the middle of the dam. Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts. We're gonna use them for demonstration footage. ...here! I wanna patch in from... Get your links set up! Dennis! Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn. Take these two behind the van. Prep the launcher now. Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready. No. A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country. I almost remember what that feels like. You have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way. I think we can impose on you for a little overtime. Check the immediate area. Check it out. Vaughn. Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous... Richard Long. You know the suspect? ...-ty. ...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-... We were called in by the Jerome base... ...-mand out of Fort Bragg. I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-... Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here. Carl, Dennis, get out of sight. ...in Missoula. All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does. This river ends at a hydro dam... They'll get a break tomorrow. ...gear? Where's their protective... ...scientists. Jesus Chri-- We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam. A covert military operation riddled with civilian... ...screwup? ...what, Sam? Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major... But... ...-fall. Hemmings! Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-... They took that life away and left me with nothing. I would've in another life. Why? You're a nothing, nobody! Why? Where's Elvis?! No. It won't be long, gentlemen. ...-spite the mouth. ...and unharmed, de-... Your fellow hero, untouched... Bring him up. ...-tainer! It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason. Just give me the con-... I don't see my container. Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes. I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason. And I can't guarantee the end will be quick. ...on this miserable road to nowhere. Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end... ...never done a thing for you? ...to die for a country that's... ...and ask a simple question - Are you actually prepared... I want you to look at one another... ...your concern nor your fight. Relinquish the package and you can go. Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither... ...should be right outside. Odd, then, that his car... I assume you have one. Actually, I was just looking for a restroom. I beg your pardon? ...dangerous. Assumptions are always... Iced coffee. Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene? Is this your establishment?Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have? There's nothing in here, sir. They got away with it. Closin' down, sir.Kabula's out. Geneva just pulled the plug. Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--? Go. Rangers. It's after five... You got thirty minutes. Video lock....tight! ...we're gonna seal that tunnel! I want it air-... Great. All right... Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel! Major! Forty-nine? No sign of 'em... ...now! Hit it... Negative. Negative. Get ready to take it out! What's going on, colonel? All right, let's move... Sir, we can't just let him get away with this! Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. Whatever you want. Please! ...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck? I did what I could for you... So...where's my truck?And where are you going? Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer. Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh? It must've happened right after we left. All right. Enough. Look... Mason? No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper. ...-son. A man named Tim Ma-... ...-five. One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-... Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office. ...colonel? What the hell are you talkin' about... I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about. Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department....have it. You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder. You-You can't let him... ...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it. ...here. Mason... ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in... Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-... I had no idea how powerful it was. We do need your truck. ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. Mason, you have to take this... So far, ye-yes. ...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island. All right. After they put you away... ...men every time I've closed my eyes? But after you went away, I-- Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those... Grateful? ...that. I know where the blame belongs. But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew. The government did... ...me? Well, you could've saved yourself the trip. Is that why you're here? To blame... No, go-- ...about-- ...I wish they would've let me say something... Andrew... It's too... You'll kill us all! No! No! ...destroyer of worlds." "I am become Death, the... Let's proceed. You have my word on that. ...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward. Now, I know. You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe... Now listen to me. But you have no choice but to follow orders. If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine. I don't think I need to mention you could use the help. Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay? ...-lar. You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-... I don't work for you, Captain Brynner. And I changed the schedule. You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene. Ah. Uh, we both like to fish. Oh, no? Oh, caught a few, lost a few. Excellent. Couldn't sleep, Pumper. Is everything, uh, all right tonight? ...that the prey can bite back. And only then does our noble friend realize... ...-m-means, Mason. The only one who understands what this me-... You're the only one I can trust. Everything will die, Mason. Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees. ...or it'll ignite. The compound has to be kept cold... No... Mason. Some people might. ...is death. ...without caution... ...and that power... ...back... ...forcing him to strike. And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite... ...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive... Tie a fly... Turn the power of the hunter against him. There's only one way you can do it, Mason. How can we ever hope to win against the trout? ...the master of his realm. ...sensitivity without neurosis. He's... He's brains without ambition... ...is a perfect hunter. No, that's not possible, Mason. The trout... My secret? What? We don't have an hour. We're already supposed to be shut down. How much longer for the range and power projections? So reaction temperature is fifty degrees. Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?big balls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh. Oh, oh! Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us. That's bullshit. No. ...us. Look. That's negotiating? He threatened to kill... ...face" crap you've been telling me? What about all that "no need to get in the man's... Thank you. Yeah. Patriotism is its own reward. Us. Owes us. You. You, Arlo. Who had to put a gun to your head? You did help a little. Excuse me. I got a bullet in my leg. They aren't exactly gonna publicize this, Arlo. Elvis is still in there! It's gonna go off! What'd you come back for?! They'll meet you at the top. Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis. You go. Let's go! Yeah, yeah, yeah. ...another way outta here. Hey. There's gotta be... ...-ta get outta here! We got-... It's working. Come on. Come on. Oh. What? It says forty- nine. What's it say? I'm gonna kill him. You've gotta be... What the hell? Forty-seven. You'd better floor it. Whoo! Tunnel. ...our ass! And Brynner's right on... I've got the real thing! Okay. Forty-five seven! Oh, fuck! ...-ful?! Aw, shit. Would you be more care-... Stop. Go! Sometimes the prey bites back. ...to him. That's why I didn't give it... Go, go, go! Arlo! Okay. Yeah. Come on! Reach into my pocket. Arlo! Arlo. Put your hand in my pants. Hey, hey, hey. Arlo, shut up. Hey, just shut up. Huh? Listen, Arlo. No. Ow! You all right? Bring him down! Yeah, I know, I know. Yeah. Whoo! ...split. Well, all the same. If we get to Missoula, help me find a car. I'd appreciate it. Then...you can... ...shit. ...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this... Listen, Arlo... We got two paddles. Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene. And things sort of just went downhill from there. Couldn't deal with it. So I split. Never gonna throw a ball in the pros. ...hospital. And I put the car into a ditch. He spent eighteen weeks in the... We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar. I was drivin'. Yeah, Robert Del Rio. Started every game my senior year. Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback. Got taken in the first round. We were nationally ranked. You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State. Yeah. ...truck. So you took his... It won't even start half the time. ...stole the truck. Hey, I didn't steal the truck. You... You're fucked, man. This river's fed by a glacier. Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees. What? No! Keep still. Come on! I don't want you to come anyway. ...here! Then stay... Taking it down the hill. I'm crazy? I'm a dangerous man! Hey, put it back! We're takin' off. All right, let's go. Aw, shit These'll keep it cold. Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that. Okay. All right. Come on. Go on. Hey! Hang on! ...ho! Ho, ho... Gee, you think so? Shit. You gotta pass him. You okay? I made it. I made it! Whoo! All right, you got it, you got it! Get over! Get over! Left, left, left! ...easy, easy, easy. Oh... Oh, shit. Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, shit. Goddamn! Okay. That's right. Now, move! ...do we? I don't think we have much of a choice... ...we can make it. I think... Oh, shit. Fuck! All right, you got it. ...up! Back up! Back... ...man! Holy shit... You snatch that phone from me one more time, I'm-- Shut up, shut up! It's beeping. ...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right? Yeah... You wanna hit me? Hi--! The gun was empty! ...I'm not the psycho. No... I was thankin' you, asshole! Nice job back there. Elvis is on ice again. All right. ...-ed. ...work! It's not even load-... Doesn't... Doesn't work. Shut up. No, no, no, no, no. Keep goin'. Ah, one of them's in the back. ...-damn! God-... Fine. Shut up. ...fine. That's... Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour. We're goin' to McGruder. ...the ice cream for money! ...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?! You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell... You stole this truck! That's... You stole this truck! You stole this truck. Borrowed. Am I missing somethin' here? ...-er. No way. We're goin' through McGrud-... No, no, no, no, no. We gotta go to McGruder! I go where the truck goes! Billings? No, no, no, no, no. We need to go to McGruder. No cell. We're clear. ...town. You'd better coast through... ...excuse me. Can you fix this? Excuse me... What the hell's goin' on? Come on! ...up. Shut... Come on, get in the truck. That dog ain't mean. What did you do that for? It makes him mean as a snake. You gave him ice cream, didn't you? Come on, let's go. There we go. There we go. Did you keep it safe? Did you Look, put this in the back. Keep it safe. Go on. I need your truck! All right, then how about this? I'll rent the truck from you. You can stay here, you can go. Whatever you want. I got fifty bucks. I'll get more. I got, uh.... I got, like, uh....
