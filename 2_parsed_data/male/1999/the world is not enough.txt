I love Christmas in Turkey. We�ve got to get out. Count to twenty. I�ll be there. Count to twenty. When you get to twenty open the hatch. It can only be opened for a few seconds or we�ll sink. Just wanted to put him on edge... Like riding a bike. He�s sealed himself in. We go down to the torpedo bay. If I don�t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden�s Tower, M is dead. Elektra would control it all. Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world... Made to look just like an accident. Nuclear. She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now. And M�s life is part of the bet. I was hoping you could tell me. Makes her look even more innocent. Elektra King. It�s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack. The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium. I did kill us. She thinks we�re dead. And she thinks she got away with it. Then it�s no longer a bomb? Alright then, brunch. When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner? With this? Bond -- Shame you had to spot I wasn�t the real thing. Here�s your imposter. He�s paid off the men on the plane outside. They�re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they�re flying it wherever he tells them. Couldn�t make it. Splitting headache. Don�t know any doctor jokes. Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...? I could come for a second opinion? Perhaps after this ... test? It�s just a scratch. I need you to pass me fit now, Molly. Is maybe...the inside woman. They�re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons? I can�t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin... The report King bought. It�s a manual. Renard�s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead. The worm on the hook again. He�s not through yet. Renard doesn�t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there�s more coming in. He�s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline. And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you. �That which does not kill me makes me stronger.� He survived? Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist? Renard. Who? The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra. I was the one who brought that money in... I took the initiative. Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle. Largest landlocked body of water on Earth. Oil-rich. Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it. It�s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall. She�s not a girl anymore. Who buys classified reports for three million pounds. Old friend? Construction�s not exactly my line. The name? Your last chance. Give me the name. And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss. Who did you get it from? Which is neutral, no doubt. Haven�t you heard the news? So is she. She�ll get over it. Consider me ungrateful. You will never touch her. You will never get near her. Who is it? Revenge isn�t so hard to fathom. What�s clever is getting someone else to pay for it. Indeed. I�m sorry. You knew him well? Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs. Yes. One... last... screw? Elektra, it�s not too late. Eight million people needn�t die. No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident. Was this all about the oil? So you killed your father. You turned Renard. All this, because you fell for Renard? Where�s M? Not interested. I�m coming with you. He used your exact words. I think you do. You can drop the act, it�s over. We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me... Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard? A little. Does it matter? After all, what�s the point of living if you can�t feel alive? Isn�t that right, Elektra? Isn�t that your motto? How did you survive? Shush. Not at that price. Time to surrender. I understand it�s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end. If this little show is for my benefit, I�ll take you home right now. What the hell are you doing here? Two. Shaken not stirred. I have to go to work. No. You�ll be safe here. I have to go. ...you should rest. I think you�re one of the bravest people I�ve ever met. I can�t stay. It�s the only way out... You�re not going to. We�re alright. No. Always wanted to see the upper lines. I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King�s daughter. The killer doesn�t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn�t want to see you take over... It�s not the pin your father wore. It�s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company. Does this look familiar to you? How long has he been with you? Who is he? Is that why you want to finish the pipeline? Funerals aren�t exactly memorable. Yes. How appropriate. The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea. Where? This is too big for even you. Where is it? Where�s the sub going?! And the payoff on the tables? No. The truth! She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you. What do you know that she would kill you for? Now...where were we? You are out of your league. She�s working with Renard. She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn�t even bat an eyelid. She was paying you off. What for? What�s your business with Elektra King? She�s no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant. But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline. How high up does this...arms dealing go? Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me. If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division. How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons? Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world. A nice little rat�s nest. You, of course. I need some information. Valentin Zukovsky....yes?... Then maybe I�d be... open to that. James. It wouldn�t really be... Dislocated collar bone. If any more tendons snap... It won�t just be two weeks out of action.I can�t tell you... Alright, alright! But you must protect me! Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me? Your last chance. Take the money. I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner... I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent. Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..The inside man? Then Robert was right about a Russian connection. Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn�t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that. Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge. The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man. The doctor who saved him couldn�t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he�s a dead man. How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I�d do the same again. Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra�s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me. I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him. Claude Serrault. A.K.A... It�s a message. He wants us to know he�s back. I�m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it. You haven�t been given an assignment in this case. Who told you to look at Elektra�s files? And now it�s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought. 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea? Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose. I�ve scheduled a medical for you. Elektra? Running King Industries? I�ve known that girl all her life. I�m not sure she knows what she�s walking into. Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He�s a man of great integrity. Quite the opposite, in fact. Someone will come. Your father... Perhaps this isn�t the time... I�ll send someone out. Any word from him? Where it can do the most damage. The parcel�s in the post. Marvellous. Do we have the range of Renard�s plane? We�ve been pawns in someone�s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate. Cock-sure.In case you�ve forgotten. I�m dead already. You even brought the plane for us. We really couldn�t have done it without you. It�s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6. So distressing for M. An explosion inside her lair. Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva? You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no? She�s beautiful isn�t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed... Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune. I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty. Yes. Au revoir... This is the end. He was a...good lover? Why are you like this? Because Bond is dead? It�s what you wanted. So beautiful. So smooth, so warm. Is it?Still no contact yet. It�s heading for the oil terminal. Anywhere in this circle. Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan... And expensive. Cost three million plus.I�d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years. The Maiden�s Tower. Mother of God. Istanbul. So. My way. No MI-6, no Interpol. Just you, me and my people. This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out! No! Get me out! A special job. A...a...a submarine. Alright, alright! Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her. Russian stuff. A rope! That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined! As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks. I thought you were the one in her business. Really Bond, couldn�t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears? Ah, I see. A purely...plutonic relationship. What are doing, Bond? Trying to impress this innocent thing? Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you. That too. Everyone does what they can to survive. Where did you get this? What? This is not possible. See? You�re upsetting my customers. What do you want? Have some of the rat�s nest caviar. From my own fishery. They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House. Bond, I�m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family�s, now it�s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble... BondJamesBond. What brings you here? C-class. In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo. Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit. No! Bond! To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
