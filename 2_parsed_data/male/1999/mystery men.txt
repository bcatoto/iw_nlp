Hey, do I look like a Man? Atta, boy! Do it, big boy! We could really use some coffee -- Much less go outside. I was eight. He was the last time I saw him. My father had this friend... He was an inventor... The Disco Boys. And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do. Really? I'm his daughter. Or even what it looks like. Sounds good to me. They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes. Come on, Junior, it's a school night. It's late. I'm headin' home. I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it. But you're a superhero. But she's your mother. You gotta tell her. How about... the Savage Six? He was cute though. I'm the Bowler. Eat your mustard. Hey... you okay? Mon Captain, it's for you. What did he mean? That's two more than the Fantastic Four. I thought you'd never ask. Think positive. Get on to yourself! Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help. He's dead. Thanks. It's me... Elizabeth. Doctor Heller?That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk. Except for one little thing. I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance? Really? But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know? I knew you'd know. I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you. I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing. Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride. Darling, you've got the wrong idea. I'll be down in a jiffy. I thought you were done? Fantasizing... about you. Head hunting. Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole. We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? It must have slipped my mind. Everything's going exactly as we planned. That boy's got talent. Why bother? Superheroes. I got it. Have you considered my offer? I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them. Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you. And the light goes out... You're dead. Too bad. PLUG HIM! Are you with me... or against me? They always call the great ones nuts. I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say? Captain who? Or you'll what? CAN ME? Roy. I saw him walk you home. You're a spy. Remember the cat. Then why are you here? Come here. Me. Why not? I thought you'd chickened out on me. Terrific. I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon? You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for. You underestimate yourself. Are you an actress? I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are. Sure. Hello? I dunno. Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it. Half a Dirty Dozen! Hey... Can I buy you a beer? They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME! Frankenstein! So are you! Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on. Against. And the nuts always call themselves great. You're nuts. What did you do with Captain Amazing? Monica! What? And what if you get killed? He's a psycho! He'll kill you! What are you talking about? Are you nuts? Get out of there! Monica, where are you? I just want to be a superhero. Me, too. What have they got that we ain't got? It's home. Roy. Nothing wrong with being a waitress. I wouldn't mind being famous. It is? Why? Sure. Yeah. Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a... Every night. Hi. Or talk? Only when I'm awake... You busy after work? Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say! Good or evil, what's the difference? Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview -- So how do you know that you've ever been invisible? If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again. So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible. We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget! Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny... Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now! The great ones RIDE ALONE! Adios, muchachos! My heart died a long time ago. When are you going to take off that mask? And a skunk stinks! But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows! You're the Sphinx. Cover me! I'll drive. But she still might call! Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved. But I just don't feel it. Because that's what it is. So what else has Superman got? SO WHAT? You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF! I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure. But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause... You sure that's how you spell it? Good point. Have you ever seen him? I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know! Yeah yeah -- and that, too. What have the famous superheroes got that we don't? We had an off night, that's all. LOOK! Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it? Come on. He hasn't stolen it yet. Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey! Oh shut up. Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy! Sounds good. Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night! Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes! Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for! Shhh. Well they've crawled back out. The who? Let's go. I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out! See ya tomorrow. Like what? Cutting off my own ear? Who's chicken? What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it! And then they dump you. Nah. Why not? So why don't you just tell her! Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein! A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY! He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him! What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!He'll never make it. Snap out of it! Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers -- Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy. How's your dad? Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged! Yes! Yes!Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil. I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance? I just know. Yes. Yes. Hey... he's gone. Anybody got any? The Obliterators! Yes. No. Yes.But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is -- Let's do it. No one will believe us. Me, too. But in fact... you'd found it. The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand. I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law. I can't. The Inscrutable Six? But they all had one thing we haven't got. And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway. Who are you? He's turned into a completely normal person! What's that? So where's the art? Roy -- Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you. Maybe there was traffic. No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station. But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal. Agents? Maybe she's right. I'm soaked. Oh great. The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork. Wait!... Look! But we don't know for sure it's the same guy. Or flowers. Maybe you should try a more romantic approach. So you're chicken? Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date? Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand! I can't. I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it. But look at him... and look at us. There's a vague similarity. He doesn't miss a trick, does he? Yes, Obie-wan. Firepower costs money. The Eradicators! So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you? So you're only invisible... to yourself? But... only when no one is looking. Ow. Burgers all around. Medium. Rare. Raw. Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional. And these are my associates, the Shoveler. We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... Not yet. We're superheroes. You did? It is? I use it... to fight evil. Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am! Because... I'M A SUPERHERO! Mother... it's not what you think! Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy. Looking for... the TV Guide. Oh hi, Mom. Through there! May the forks be with us! With or without him, we gotta go! Oh no. We're outnumbered twenty to one. That was too close. But how do we get in? He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing. Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king. But, Doc... where's the machine guns? Are you sure he's still alive? Whatever our name is. And a social life. He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete. And there's the Sphinx. Do we have to? Shut up. Be a Mohican. Don't crunch the leaves. Or both. This looks like a job for Superman -- The Disco Boys. This is bad. Ask her out. She likes you. And Mister Furious... His anger is his power. We take the licks and he gets the chicks.Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People. Atta, girl! Come on, baby! And some sandwiches -- Then Captain Amazing appeared. When was that? We didn't think this through very well. So who killed him? Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing. The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago. With what? Not a chance! Are you coming or not? Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! GET MAD! This place is built like a fortress. He's got the fact that he's Superman! But there's still only six of us. There's a big difference. There's just not enough of us. Yeah. How could I see him if he's invisible? I'm liking this. And it would be the right thing to do. What are you talking about? So when are we gonna have an on night? Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours. Oh don't start that again -- Right. Where am I going? We've got lift off! It's time. Great timing! It's suicide. But we gotta find out what's going on in there. Maybe it's time we checked that place out. And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since. Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home. The bazookas? Are you sure he's still lives here? To us! Yeah, but how do we get to them? The who? I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible. Be a Mohican. Sorry. Or Batman -- We may be getting in over our heads here. Who are they? Definitely. Hi. How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen? Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?He is in love. His anger is gone. Now you're talking. It is not dead. It is hiding. Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart. When I am sure I am among friends. You drink too much. The wise snake coils before he strikes. And you are a fool.And I'm gonna nip it in the bud. Should I kill them? What about Captain Amazing? But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge. You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King... Ummm.
