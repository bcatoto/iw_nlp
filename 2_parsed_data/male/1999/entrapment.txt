Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you. Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out. In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him? Gin? Where the hell are you? Where are you at least? Don't overestimate yourself. This is dangerous. I'm sending backup. How close? Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status? You don't call, you don't write. Which you have in mind. That's doable. How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me? With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue. Why didn't I think of that? You got a better idea? Exactly. Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac. And the draft blew over the flowers. Meaning-- You ordering chop suey again? Interesting theory. Where's the proof? That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high. So he popped the pane? The windows don't open. A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry. I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life. You didn't answer the beeper either. Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.You mean the seven billion. They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going. That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me. Both sides of the street, I'm afraid. You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you-- It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express. Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong. Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets. Put this on! I cannot get rid of you. Get out of here! Go! Come on. You can do it. I sincerely hope not. The disc is still in there. Don't panic, now, there's no rush... Relax, don't jam it... Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank. They'll each be positive the other guy did it. I fear an ugly international incident. And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about... Brought us luck once, maybe it will again. They drive so recklessly there. What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower? A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast. Seen one billion, seen them all. Oh, I don't care about the money. I'm sorry. Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy. Have really held you under? But that's all behind us now. That was a lifetime ago. Call it a new tradition. There is one more thing. You shouldn't have. No way to take another day or two? Done. And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM? Packed. Charged. Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there. Can't be too careful. Like a woman of mystery. For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump. You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me. There's always a surprise. You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal. You can't be serious. So how long till we do this? You've thought of everything. Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me. It's no good without the argon gas. A parting gift from the Empire. But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer. And the money goes-- Where the money is. What's that? Right. The eight billion. Transfer. Well...What are we doing? What about the rules? I'd taken the Mask? Would you quiet down! Just for a minute? You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade. Idle hands, the devil's workshop. Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human. Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner. Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it. You've got everything planned. Hmmm...44 long. Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four? It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress. No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent-- If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split. Speaking of money. You said billions. How many? We're living history here. Get the hell in. What? There is no big job. It's your mistake. What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask. Okay, you're a thief. You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in. Now's when you tell me who you really are. The Mask. Careful...careful. Be careful not to break the laser beams. Behind you. Can you see the other PIRs? Ready? Yes, you can. You can spoil a perfectly nice dance. These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed. You're not on the beat. Let's mingle a little, shall we? We're working. Popup, on floorboards. And-- Camera in the-- He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody. So you had to be your own lifeline. Aren't we all. How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then? You were afraid of heights? You're nervous again. To our...partnership. Little celebration before we set off. Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen. Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it. It's not a village. There's nothing there. Thank you. Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share. I trust it's your size. One more item--not on the check list. Charged? The lipstick thermal camera? And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock. So how long to pop the floor? Yes you did. It was a long time ago. Our equipment has arrived. Try laps. Say a hundred. We are...for the tools. So you're testing me now? So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job. A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner. On what? Another job? Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we? No one needs anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want. You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before. The Rembrandt--that was quite good. True enough. I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name. Nice try. Everyone thinks I did. A lifelong problem, I'm afraid. This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room. Pack up. I'll see you get back to London. I go in alone. Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad. We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside? So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel. That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day. Only a week? Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end? I know it well. It is. Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes. Good morning. You're late. My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure. I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do. Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could. And-- Lose something? You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance? What's your problem? I'm doing the job. No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers. I'm a thief. Sue me. Certainly not mine. Come on. I never carry...baggage. I'm not the one to ask... We're only going one way. Got it. Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out. Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail. Damn, I knew I forgot something. That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket. Look on the back. What do you see? Can you follow simple directions? Give him the card. I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers. It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card. That's my girl. If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask? Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney. Very nice. Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes. Possibly. Oh? Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself. Roki has a vivid imagination. So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired. It's not for sale. That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back... The Empress Death Mask. For God's sake. Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth. Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you? Not interested. And I thought we were getting on so well. Oh, that's quite all right. No charge. Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way. You're shaking. Are you nervous? Of course I can. I have a note from mother. Do you mind? So what? Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously. I sincerely hope so. Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit. Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says. You're joking. You can't trust anyone these days. It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me. You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely. It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit. Seems I am. Meet me in front. Five minutes. You have a car? Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you. Then don't. Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows? Check, please. You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it. How about if you try disappearing. I can't? A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes. Why are we speaking Chinese? That is of no interest. I have a question... Probably not. Yes it does. My friend, you always surprise me. I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer. The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality. Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not. You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag? What matters isn't what's real. It's what we think is real--what matters is the art. Call it an expression of trust. Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each. She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know. You'll just have to have faith. You know where my loyalties lie. It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now? She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is. She's calling the shots now. This is just show and tell. It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any. Check out my ball. I'm terribly sorry old man. Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter. Suspicious, after all these years? We're supposed to. Because it pays off. So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me. But the second mouse gets the cheese. It's too soon. You look like George Washington. I said a masked ball, not a costume party. Oh, it is. I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4. Black of course. I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga. Right. It's a death mask. Death mask means dead. It's never big enough. We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one. You are a miracle worker. If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient. We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC. The key to success is using the right tools. The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera? And you do it so well. I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good. Tina was a wonderful woman. Which is-- Next time I'll use valet parking.Gin, really. Always in a rush. A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?Yeah. Probably not. See you. I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill. Takes a lot out of you, one like this. We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her... Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died? You got a real problem with priorities, you know that? I figured that out. Thought you had to use some of these. You're giving them to me? Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust. To yourself, that's where. You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder. My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v. She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more. You're impressed with her, aren't you? I'm waiting for the tell part. That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind. Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad? Tonight your league night? You damn well thought wrong. You change partners, you change the rules. You better not be taking on a new partner. You two make quite a couple. Remind me why. The early bird gets the damn worm. I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight. How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference? It better be worth it for me. This better be worth 1t. That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper. Because I never assume anything. Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive? This is big enough. Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days. Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable. You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner? Had to get a liquid plasma screen. Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries. Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it. In the van. They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack. I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
