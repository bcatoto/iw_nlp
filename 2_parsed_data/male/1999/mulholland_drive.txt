Get out of the car.  You feel it?  Yeah.  Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.  Two men... two guns in the Caddy.  The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.  Yeah, they showed me  Could be unrelated.  Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?  No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.  That's what I'm thinkin'.  Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?  I just wanted to come here.  To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?  This Denny's.  Okay. Why this Denny's?  It's kind of embarrassing but,  Go ahead.  I had a dream about this place.  Oh boy.  You see what I mean...  Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.  Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.  So, you came to see if he's out there?  To get rid of this god-awful feeling.  Right then.  Around here.  Dan! ... Dan! You all right? ... Dan!  It's time to say goodbye, Betty. It's been so nice travelling with you.  Where to?  Got it!  Hi there...ten bucks says you're Betty.  So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.  Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?  Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.  Making ends meet, huh.  Hardly.  Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.  Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.  It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.  Yeah, that's a funny story.  Yeah, the history of the world in phone numbers.  What the hell .... what happened? What's this cord doing here? It's the vacuum. It's the vacuum what did it.  So what's the problem?  There is no problem.  So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.  What was it last time?  He isn't gonna like it.  We'll see.  Hello ... who're we talkin' about here?  You see Adam... there are some suggestions which are to be brought forward ... and I know you said you would entertain suggestions and that's all anybody here is asking you to do.  What're you talking about?  An open mind ... You're in the process of re-casting your lead actress and I'm... (looks around) We're asking you to keep an open mind.  Ah... the Castigliane brothers. Let me introduce you around ... please ... sit down. (after they've already seated themselves) ... this is Mr. Darby whom you know and this is the director Adam Kesher and his manager Robert Smith  May I offer you gentlemen anything?  Espresso.  Nothing.   Uh  what's the photo for?  One espresso ... no, that's it. I think you're going to enjoy your espresso this time... I've been doing quite a bit of research knowing how hard you are to please... this one comes highly recommended.  What's the photo for?  A recommendation... a recommendation to you Adam.  Not a recommendation.  This is the girl.  What girl? For what? What is this Ray?  We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.  Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.  This is the girl.  Ray...you better take care of this.  Hold on ... hold on, Adam.  Hold on!!!!!!!! There's no way, there's no way!!!  Napkin.  Pardon?  Napkin.  Of course. Excuse me.  Is shit!  I'm sorry. That was a highly recommended...  That's considered one of the finest espressos in the world , Sir.  Wait a minute!! What's going on here?  There's no way that girl is in my movie!  That is the girl.  Hey!!!!! That girl is not in my film!!!  It is no longer your film.  You'd better fix this, Ray!!!  I'll speak to someone.  And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me! And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!  This is a catastrophe... you told me they might insist on a girl, that's all.  Why didn't you tell me, Robert? That's what I mean ... you set me up! I woulda never come here. I'm leaving. I'm a director you don't want to lose ... you guys better fix this!!  Well...I didn't know that was going to happen.  Did the Castigliane brothers get out of that limo?  Castigliane brothers?  Beat it!  O.K.  Raymond Harris ... 20743.  You may go right in, Ray.  Good afternoon Mr. Roque. (pronounced Rowk).  I know they said...  Then?  Then... I guess it's so .... alright, but that means we should ...  Yes?  Shut everything down ... Is that something that...do you want us to shut everything down?  The other car is here sirs. Please allow me.  Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.  No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.  My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.  You're so easy.  Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.  Yeah, what for?  Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.  What's  the matter now?  Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.  It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.  Not a coke or anything?  Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.  A brunette? ... maybe beat up?  You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?  You bet you will.  Yes?  Hello.  She's still missing.  Talk to me...  Same.  Office...  It's me. Where's Cynthia?  Stage One.  Right baby, all Hell's broke loose down here. I'll try to find her.  What's going on, Cynthia?  What did you say?  Who fired everyone?  No.  I'm going home.  I'm going home Cynthia.  I'm going home. I'll call you later.  Ah, Mister ... you remember me. I am Taka. your gardener. For long time I not see you. I pleased to see you.  Hello Taka. It's 'cause I'm never home in the day time. It's good to see you again. The garden looks great.  Lorraine... Lorraine ... you home?  Just forget you ever saw it. It's better that way.  He's probably upset Lorraine.  That's not a way to treat your wife, buddy. I don't care what she's done.  Is this an emergency?  Hold for the number.  Hollywood Police Department  Hold please. I'll connect you to traffic.  Traffic. Sergeant Baxter speaking.  Yes, there was.  No. I can't.  May I have your name please?  Adam Kesher...he...  This is Adam Kesher's house. Where...  I guess you don't understand English. She asked to leave. Here's the door.  Yes...what is it?  I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.  ... What??  The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.  How...  how'd they know I was here?  I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.  So, what did they say?  Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.  Unbelievable. Look... here. I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?  That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.  Fine. I'll check out in the morning.  Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.  Someone's shut off my money!  What do you mean "you know"?  And?  But I'm not broke.  Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.  The Cowboy??  Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?  Cynthia...what's going on?  And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?  You gotta be kidding?  Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?  Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.  I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.  Git along little dowgie and call me back.  Howdy!  Howdy to you.  Beautiful night.  Yeah.  Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.  No problem. What's on your mind?  Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?  Whatever.  A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?  Sure.  Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?  I agree with what you said...truly.  What did I say?  That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.  So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.  How's that?  Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?  Okay, I'm thinking.  No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?  Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?  There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?  One.  So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.  Okay.  Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...  It will work out.  Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?  I understand.  You're an understandin' fella.  So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?  No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.  Okay.  Nice wallets.  Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.  The one of 'em still alive?  Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.  Oh yeah.  Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.  Find out who they are?  Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.  Interesting.  Yeah ... and they both use the same address.  Where at?  Palmdale.  Damn, that's a long drive.  And where do we think we're going, Miss?  And who are we auditioning for today?  And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?  Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?  Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?  Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.  Number 43, on the left.  May I help you?  Good. Perfect timing. Have a seat and I'll get Mr. Brown.  Betty Elms?  I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.  Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.  And this is Martha, Martha Johnson, who you met out front.  Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?  Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?  No ... it's not a contest, see, the two of them with themselves, so don't play it for real until it gets real.  Just tell me where it hurts, baby.  I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?  That'd be good, Jimmy. Just don't rush that line again. I told you... the line where you say, "Before what?"  I was playin' off 'em. They say, "They'll arrest you"... and stuff like that.. "put you in jail"... they say it like that. They all say it the same way, so I react like that.  Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.  Bob?  And ... ACTION!  I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.  Really?  So ... surprise!  But you won't.  You know what I want...it's not that difficult.  What about you? What will your dad think about you?  Before what?  Then they'd put you in jail.  Wow!  There it was it was! Baby, you got a way!  Bob?  Very good. Really. I mean it was forced maybe but still humanistic. Yeah, very good, really.  Well, thank you Betty, and I mean that. That was very impressive. You've done your Aunt proud and I'm going to tell her the first chance I get. We'll speak again soon I'm sure, and thank you so much for coming in.  Well, yes indeed. Our pleasure, Sarah, and don't you be a stranger. We'd love to see you around here again real soon.  Cut it!  Look... I love you, but there's no way they're gonna let me cast this thing until I've seen everyone. I'll let you know as soon as I can.  It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of here.  See ya later.  Camilla Rhodes.  Is she ready?  All ready.  Bring her out.  Camilla Rhodes next!  Playback!  Yeah?  Get Jason over here.  Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.  Did you want to tell me something, Adam?  This is the girl!  Excellent choice, Adam.  Hey!  No ... not you... I'm sorry... I forget your name.  Yeah. Well, I haven't seen Sol lately. Tell him to come by the club.  Cornell Dumont.  Hello. Adam. How's it going? No, it's okay. Yeah, I'm working, but... they wanted this script a week ago. What? What's wrong with your house? The poolman? Sure, you can have the couch. No, it's no problem..it's just I gotta ... I gotta work. Any chance you could bring some food. No, I got plenty of money - I just haven't gone out for awhile. Groovy man!
