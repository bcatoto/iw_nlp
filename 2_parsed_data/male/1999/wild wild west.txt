I'm sure we will. What is this? A whole new train? All right, all right... It'll be okay. I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam. The machine was stopped! It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?! Oh, I see, an easy plan! My God! He's so excessive! God in heaven, what is that?! My hat is off to you, sir. Of course not. It was in your book. Oh, well, then let's kick some ass! I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men? I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers! What? President Grant is...! My pleasure. Excellent detective work, sir. You should have the honor of going first. What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim? Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty. You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it? I adjusted it. My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case. I spent three years on the stage, you know. Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear. This? I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds. Relax. We're almost there. Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot." It's a town! Willard... Yes. And a much nicer one than ours. What's this? You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen. It is? Oh, damn! That's it. Shhh! Come on. Tell us something! A cylinder recorder. My own design. Know what this is? You go ahead. I'll stick with Loveless. Thank you. Can you fill me in here? They're so precious when they're asleep. Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded. I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun. Uh... how long ago was this? So... what happened? Well... that, too. So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot. If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are? Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas. Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works. Jim, are you all right? That's right... That's good. Damn it, this is ridiculous. Hey, I tried the board. It's a repeating steam cannon! Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention. Garrison...? Then the President was right. Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again. All that jumping and kicking. What was all that back there? Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it. Now, what was that? Come on, Jim. I'm serious. Dot... Dash. It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it. Yes. Now, observe.... You know your Morse Code almost as well as I. Then we've got our proof. Excellent. And where do we find this fortunate scientist? Whoa, Jim. Maybe. But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe. Quite. Come, let's mingle. Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet. Come Llewellyn, don't tarry. My disguise. And here... Doyle, once around the park. I need a moment to prepare. Absolutely. Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women. Limestone quarry? Yes. Starting with a screw. Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but... Potentially. This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues. The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology. Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain. Yes, aha. A brass screw. Aha! I'll work on it. Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots... Try what? Good Lord, man. The world is changing. And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention. We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace! Always hoping. Or this... Attractive buttons, yes? But yank one off, toss it, and poof! It emits a cloud of sleeping gas. "Gadget guy?" While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science. Sorry. Didn't mean that. Just a little device of mine... "Ay, there's the rub." Take a look at this file on Professor Morton. Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy. A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes? Or maybe just someone who hates scientists. Eight scientists. Eight different fields of endeavor. Hydraulics, optics, ballistics... Wouldn't dream of it. If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco. Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same. Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir. And best of luck in all your future endeavors. Interesting. Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk... Congratulations. Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark. Valet? You jest of course. I am a U.S. Marshal. Artemus Gordon. Bach, he's the composer. J. S. Bach. Time for you to get off, Ma'am. Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid... But it only has six legs. You didn't tell us you had this on! You? Dr. Pemberton? Of course. How novel. Terribly sorry. I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong. Federal agents, ma'am. We're rescuing a kidnap victim...Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir? Doyle's the name, sir. Of the Connemara Doyles. And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself. That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way! Your friend's already aboard. That would be correct. Orders from the President himself. Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays. Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well. Your private train, sir. Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.A mistake? To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry? How is that a mistake? French? Damn it, I want my own man on this case. Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture! French? Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories. And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence. Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not? He didn't. That's your job. I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck. Nice train. But mine's nicer. On my way to Denver... And now the job's yours. Goddamnit! What am I doing? What's happened to all my cigars? Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year. No arrests, no leads, no clues... Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking. We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science. And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way! Exactly. Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth. And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced. This is Colonel Richards. That'll be all, boys.Well, we'll stay in touch... you know. Well, sure. Didn't you get your orders? Artemus! Look at that. Brand spanking new. She's a beauty, huh? Let's get rolling. In the next two minutes? He was going to shoot me! Do you mind?! Pull the balloon right in front of him! We'll board the damn thing! Where have you been? That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts! Thank you. Are those just button buttons or...? Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance. There's only seventy-eight. We've got to stop him right here, now! With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter. I know! I know! Artemus, you ready for this? His next target is Albuquerque. Oh, thank you. Not likely. There must be tracks of twenty different wagons. Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards... When we find him, he is mine. So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand? Not again. And people are actually fooled by that? What is that? We oughta get a couple of those rockets. Voom! We're there before we left! Damn, I wish this thing would go faster. That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota... Willard, New Mexico? It's not a guy... Sounds like a train. Looks like a train. No record of him. He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard. It's better than nothing. This is good. Sure. It's a wind-up... thing. Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton. Sure. We have no idea what's going on. You really enjoy yourself, don't you? I find most criminals slip up somewhere... You might have mentioned you had that. I was six. And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later. Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back. Nothing much to it really. When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys. I saw them coming. But I didn't act fast enough. Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly. "Spontaneous." I like that. Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch." What way is that? No, I'm not all right. They got away. And we can't even follow them. They can get off the tracks anywhere they want. At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it. Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting. At least I tried something. Never seen a gun fire so fast! I'm going to hit you. And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it. That? Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco. Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me I've got a book on it, if you're interested. All what? You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello." You feeling all right? Almost? All right. How about this? We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him... Doctor V. L. Pemberton. I knew it. He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine. I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man. Do your own mingling. I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey. That's a lot of butler. Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong. Prepare what? Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party. What about the explosive? Starting with a screw? Is this leading somewhere? Aha? That should put us ahead of the criminals. Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful. All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that. No offense, but all I ever need... Are these... And this. You need that real often? Wait a minute. Now I know where I've heard of you. You're the gadget guy. Then why kidnap them? Why not just kill them? Put them all together and what do we have? But don't pull that again. You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy. But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment. Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are. So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened? Your train? Listen, friend, you're obviously lost. ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime. Funny. So am I. I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something? Jim West. You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me. You bring the best out in a man. Really? Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting? I've had some practice. Oh, I would hope not. Just a little insurance... against the unexpected. I suppose so. But life can be hard for a man, too. Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type. You tell me. I don't like to lose, either. Well, I owe you one, don't I? Your guests, ma'am? Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas. Please do. I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm. You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle. My name's Tyler. Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. I would, Mr. Doyle! Are you game? My friend? Private train? Look, I'm Captain James West... Where'd he say he was going to do this? ... well, of course you can. Mr. President, what a surprise. What brings you here? And? Nicely said, sir. But what would anyone have to gain from all this...? Unless it were a foreign power. Nice to finally meet you, sir. Good work. Really. Mr. President, good to see you again, sir. Sorry about all that. Easy now. So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer? Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you? "Emperor Miguelito...?" That would be... the Mexican War? The U.S. is my jurisdiction. Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader? You got that right. Now get up. We're walking out of here. He had a pressing engagement. You're not that big. Dr. Loveless? Why don't we just cut this routine short? Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk. How embarrassing. Did I hold up three fingers? I deal with some tough customers. No, sir... just a businessman. I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant. I admire a man with a sense of humor. I beg your pardon? Now it's a bomb. This is something. He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out. Are you all right? A glass eye? That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison. Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army. I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him. He used to wear an eye-patch. Who was this partner of his? We'll explain on the way. Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe. Dr. Pemberton? Right. You're not going to use it, are you? In an hour they're gone! When are they coming? Well?Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs. I could get used to this, looking down on people. Wonderful! Our new friend from the wild west. Please... Anyone? A new friend? Easy? Easy? On just what grounds should I take it easy!? Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West! A town a day will disappear! Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park. Next, I level all of Albuquerque! Yes, that's right. Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there. What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me! After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire! The first. I've even printed my own currency. Call it what you like. The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West. It belonged to my beloved grandmother! Now I intend to have it back. My own country! These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression. Exactly! You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces. Or haven't you checked a map lately?! Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers? You are in my domain! Philistine. Still alive. Hmm. I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno. Restrain yourself, Voltaire. He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant. ... And do give me some room, Voltaire. You're breathing on my head! I hate it when you breath on my head! Talk? About what...? Oh! About who you are and all that? Sir... I believe you have only two barrels. Really? Must be a dangerous business. Very good, sir! I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade. Thank you. I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have. When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?Like hell! I'll see it through! Ram the bastard! He's not giving up? He calls it the Tarantula. My Lord, he was telling the truth! Yes, me! You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this. It is? It's a smelting retort. He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he? For the moment. But I fear not for long. I'm of no use to him now. A Southern gentlemen. I don't recall his name. I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye. I only met him once, but that was enough. For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself. He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him. He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place. He had all sorts of specifications. But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman. Both he and his partner had no real love of steam. It's sad. So few men do. Who were they? What do they want with me? Yes!Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake. I mean... Yes sir. Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man. And he's no ordinary Marshal. He's quite sophisticated. Three college degrees. A master of disguise. Speaks French... Well, yes sir. A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men... Hey...! They're rounding up a posse. Figure an hour? They're coming.
