She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance? No, I'm not! My mom taught me. Really? I'm Adam Webber. Thank-Q! You like it? I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here. Hi! The key to my hotel room! I want you to have my baseball cards! And please be sure to pay my bill! Yes, ma'am. I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow. For how long? Come where? Fallout shelter. There's a difference. How do you do? It certainly is. I agree with you completely. Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself. I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair. Well, isn't he? And shallow, as well? Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair? Please excuse this interruption. Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just-- How do you do? My mother's like that. See! I can't tell them that! I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke. I can't let that happen. You understand? Could I please just go home? I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again. ...All right, Eve. If you say so. Hi, Eve! And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious! It was at least as good as the sky. Not at all. And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first. Of course. I shouldn't be over here at this hour. Yes, Eve? No. "All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live." It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves. But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi. But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel. There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live." You know it? I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable. Thanks. I know first aid! Eve, if you'll let me, I can -- What? I know...and I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry! Eve?! But, Eve, I would-- Eve, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962-- No. I admire you. I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you. I did. I think that you are the most-- I've never lied to you. I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied. Why are you suddenly so mad at me? You wanted to see me! Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end. Okay. All right. And what do I say? That's ridiculous. Really? What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her? Okay. I like that. How 'bout this one? Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that! Or why Cliff would say that about you. Why?! I think she's very attractive. What about her? It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told. I like her. I thought I was here to meet women. Good-bye! Do I look crazy? My goodness gracious! This place is something! Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend. Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left! No it's not! I certainly do! Yep. You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that. Hey, Eve! Okay! It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair! Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo. About clothing? The guy with the underpants! The what? All right. May I please be excused? In the house? He has a computer? Where's he gone? Good for you. Wow. Yes! Um-hum. Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em! Thank-Q! Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants. Why, thank you! Very nice to have met you, Cliff! May I ask you a question? I like it. Is this your house? You said it would be easy! I told you I've never driven before! Sorry! Yes, ma'am! The engine is still running. Of course. That's what I was afraid of. Two weeks. And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena. One who's not a mutant. It didn't used to be that way. They're all divorced? I didn't know that. It does? Bites what? I don't want to be alone. Because I want to get married. Yes. Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife. This is for me. Then forget it. Well, this is going to sound a little crazy. There's something else I would like you to help me with. Okay. And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh... You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - - but, I'd just be lost without you. I guess we'll need another locker. We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry. Hey, you know. I was thinking... Sorry. Wait! Wait! Hey! Pipe tobacco! I'm going to need all of this! This is swell! My Mom and Dad. They like Dr. Pepper. You got it! Wait here while I change. What's fair? Two weeks. Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help. Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks. Why not go to work for me? ...Okay. Why does it never work out? You and...men? Why doesn't it never work out? Cross my heart and hope to die. Watching television in color. I think it's the eyes. Thank-Q! Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend? Can't you please just talk to me for one second? Wait, Eve, please! Wait. I haven't brushed yet. Okay. I can't, it's yours. I am so glad to see you!! I thought I'd never see you again! Right. That was...wonderful! I've never felt anything like that in my life. Gee-zooie!! You better slow down!!! Hey, what are you doing?! Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off! Oh, I could die... Perry Como! You had him! Go back! Go back! It's Perry! Wait! Wait! It's Webber. Adam Webber. Heck, no! What?! Yes. Yes. So what?! I've got two of him! And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too. He's all yours. I was holding him back. Wait! Please wait! I'll make a deal with you! I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel! I'm sorry! I said something wrong, didn't I! Please forgive me! Nope. If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun. Do you own a car? It was amazing. Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right! Again. Right. So far? Oh, that's nice. I don't know. Why doesn't it? I came on a bus. I just had a mental picture of... Dickhead? Say,...did you just lose your job because of me? No, I'm lost. Where are we going? Yes, ma'am. But my name is Adam. Get out of here! No. I'm from out of town. I'm here on business. Bon soir, mademoiselle! Of course! A card? Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel. Nothing. Is this because of the radiation? Gee-ma-nee! Is that a birthday cake?! I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man... I promise. How do I leave here? That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it. I've got to go, now. I know it has been terrible. But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand? All in yellow? Oh! That was my father! Are you all right? Uh, I think they have. Yes. That's kind of how it was. Yes, sir. It's true. Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over. Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers. It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here. And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why. I'll try. I promise. Is that all? Adult Bookstore. Why? Yes, sir. Is that all? Yes, father?! Yes? Merci! Shit is a French word? Well, do we just go on up?! These are really swell! I mean swell! Holy Cow! What the heck are these?! No kidding! Oh, boy! A jacket! Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad! Then why go there? Why? The nocturnal flying mammal? Like one of Mom's? Like a painting? What's baseball? These are wonderful. Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?! Gerade aus dann links! Tempus fugit! Latin exam, Dad. It's Tuesday. They're pretty. Can I have them? And thanks for always being happy! Bye, Troy! Goodbye. Does that work? No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on. What? You bet! Okay, Troy! Let's get those all-beef frozen patties! No! There's an Adult Bookstore back there! I'll be right back! Okay. Thank you, my friends. Ladies first, Troy! That was close. Oh. I see. Why did you park way back there? I LOVE THIS!! Amazing. I'm very impressed. The recovery is very impressive. I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new. No. I just don't want to. I'm not wearing his pants. ...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste. Yes. He likes windows. Oh, yes. It would probably kill him. That would knock my father out. Mt. McKinley. It's also the highest point in North America. No. I don't think so. It's so small. This must be very new. Sorry, that's the largest city. Juneau. 1867. Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course. Russia. 1959. I've got goose-bumps all over me. I've never met anyone like you in my life. Right on the button. Maybe Eve can guess. She's psychic. It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there. I love Lucy! Not particularly. You have very nice ceilings. Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight. I guess living up here makes people look older. How old do I look? Thirty-five. Good night! Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite! That's what my Mom always says... ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry. It's my first night away from home. My father is a genius. I see. Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice. Of what? Just look!! Up there!! The sky!!! Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is! Would you excuse me? Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles! Come on. Frozen. How much are they? Yes, please. I'm looking for all beef patties. Good! How do you do, ma'am. Oh, my holy stars! A Negro! I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry. Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again. Oh, that would be wonderful! See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller. Ones, fives, tens. Like that. I was thinking of selling all the cards. Hello. Yes. Eve and I...eloped. We're married. No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office. We have to go. I can't explain it now. But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything. Then we'll be back to get you. Mom? Eve and I have to go. I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist. ...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down. But we've got to hurry. Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl. I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so. Mom? Right. Yes, ma'am. I'll be all right. I'll go up. Dad! Sorry, Mom! Yes, ma'am.Young man, stop right there! Let's go talk first, Adam. Well, that depends... My office. We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences. Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown. Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life. I'm Nina Aron, Adam. Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing. And now you must let me be the judge of that! Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious. I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser-- He'll catch him. Hi. This is Nina Aron. I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.Yeah. Yeah. The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper. What about relatives? Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.Goodnight. Up here on the fifteenth floor? Twenty-five? Around there. You don't look thirty-five. How old are you? No kiddin'. Well...good night. Thank you. Your father is a smart guy. The hotel. You dial nine to get out.Gladly. Sure. You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home. Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box. Help you?I don't see anything! The sky? Where? What? What is it?!Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh... They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes! My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em! "No, we didn't drop any bombs! Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed! Poor, poor us!" I bet they've even asked the West for aid! Right?! Uh-huh. What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?" That's what everybody believes? You're sure? Uh-huh. This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it? Well, in that case...of course, son. But, I don't understand. One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you. Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget. Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore." ...the pipe tobacco. Adam...don't forget...don't forget ... C'est bon, Monsieur. Helen-Thomas-Webber! Maybe we have been down here a little too long! Please excuse her French. No, son! We wait for night. Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious. Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better! Your mom made that all by herself. Blow out the candles! Because he must! Because he's forced out at third! It's a force! No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there! No. Sit down. Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat. No, son. A pitcher. It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher. It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now. You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son! I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me. Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren! En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul�! You're right! It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?! Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam. This is what money looks like. It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper. Or you can have an "investment." These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name. Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable. No, I can't. I'm sorry! I have to go! I have to... Really? Yes, I can tell that just looking around. "Boy?" Did you say you were a "country boy?" Yes, yes, the song. So tell me...has it been...hell up here? So...you...survived the blast, did you? What?! A light! Yes, I've got a light! Some time. To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about. I thought ten years. And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam. Amen. He's smart. --do as I say! --and we will-- Well, I am the head of this household-- We'll make do. I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then-- Yes. We stay down here. They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest. I just can't. Yes. Others are...multi-sexual. It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously. It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans. Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum. I mean that literally and I mean right now! I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants. It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good". Should we say a little prayer first? I know exactly what you mean! Hey, honey? In the generator room again? Sure. You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon? If we still have one. Yeah. Let's dig in! Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful. One who doesn't glow in the dark. Well, we did in my family! If he tells, it won't come true! And I made these! You bet. Coming! Hi, honey! I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches. Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be. Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us! Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is! What? Yes. Well... yes. No reason. Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance. Which is very nice because it has the service elevator! Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway. Right here! What? Whatever you want, Helen! Yes! No. I think it's just right. I've noticed. Is there a problem? Honey? What? I told you! I've got everything! Would you like a tranquilizer? How could you?! This is just like home! Really? Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite! Burnt to a crisp. I've given you the most well-done cut. We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child. Hi, honey! Feeling better? To go up. Then after that it's safe. To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years. The locks. Home sweet home! Yes, dear! I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to. Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto! I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Give me the roast and watch your step. I'll come back for the radio. Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip? I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning. You hear that?! No. They all do. It shuts off automatically. It's time. I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance! You bet, hon! Sorry, honey! I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.Yes, sir. Fill this out please. And I'll need a card. What? Yes, it is.Eve? I'm leaving. Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature. Do ya? Shallow? I'm shallow?! What?! Oh, brother... How 'bout a drink at the bar? But I do miss that green sport coat of yours. I do fine, Adam. How 'bout yourself? You doin' any good? I guess we shouldn't fight in here. Yeah. Before I kick your ass. You know, I don't know. And looking at you, I don't care. It's been too long, Eve. Shana Gillroy's apartment. Remember her? The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going! Bye, Adam. Nice coat! Hey, they're Ralph Laurens. And who's this interesting looking fellow? I forgot some of my stuff. What are you bitching about now?Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt? Oh, you got a problem with that? Well, we're here to help! I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box. Really? No kidding? How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season? Hi.Good god. He drank it hot? All back East. Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess. According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting. Tower, say again!! I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject. Stand by. One. Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.I do alright. Say what?! Whatcha looking at?Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture. Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy. And if you want a girl, I can be a girl. I can be anything you want me to be! "Hell up here?" Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere. The blast? Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!" Good. You got a light, honey?Roger, Wolf One. The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight. Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean? Wolf One -- say intentions. Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?What? Bye, Adam! Good-bye, Adam. Yeah...Seems to. I know what you mean! I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses. A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the bookstore. So, did you buy a movie? How 'bout we check with Eve first? I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I? I'm so sorry. Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool. What?! Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car. That's why little things mean so much to him. The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months. Almost all of them. Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that? Okay. Why not? He has great pants. Not on him. True. Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that? He's a Windows guy then, huh? Yeah? Okay, maybe she is psychic. Let's go eat! How do you get through those winters? Well, you're right. Juneau. What's the highest peak? You don't have a computer in your cabin? What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker? Yeah. Hello! It's Anchorage! Gotcha! What's the capitol? When did we get it from them? Who use to own it? Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions. When did Alaska become a state? Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife? Isn't that closer? She's right?! That's right? Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town. Really? Since when? And it's called...? You nut! Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi. I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings? Where?! Yeah. Maybe he'll call. None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards. An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley? No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store. We came back to the house! To get some frozen poultry. I don't know. I like to think so. Yeah! That's thinking. Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock! The clothes! The toothpaste! The guy was on the level! And you blew it! A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?! See these? Found them in the box with the cards. These are stock certificates. IBM. AT&T. Polaroid. What's wrong? And if we can't find him? What do you want to do with it? Fallout shelter. Oh. Well, you're...certainly welcome! What?! I know...I know. You did the right thing. I don't think so. What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door? It's true. She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear. He left with Sophie. He didn't leave with them. From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo. Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses... He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady! You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior. Know what else he told me? Yes, you do! Uh, yes, you do. Yes, you do. Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy. To bed. Yeah. But who's not a slut these days? Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me. What's it to you?! We did not leave together. Uh..he might of. Right here? Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure! Um... Eve? Adam, I think for you, we should go for "sweet." Eve?! Always good advice. He's from Alaska. How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block? Let me show you the entire trousseau! Well, what do you think? What do you think, Adam? Alright, I will. That's what I'm sensing. I see "elegant." I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits. It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men. You're serious, aren't you? I don't know. But first, you have to start with the clothes! Oh, my God... Oh, yes. So, Adam...where on earth are you from? Darlin', this is X-File stuff! Think about it! The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big. Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse. Eve! This guy is un-be-liev-able!
