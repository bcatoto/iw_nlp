Just sent 'em through. Never Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan. Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?They do to! She okay? Wow No The "real you". I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually. Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure... What crap? No... You always been this selfish? Then that's all you had to say. You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you? I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied". Have fun tonight? I believe we share an art instructor Looks like things worked out tonight, huh? So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones? She's not a... I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him. Sure have. How do you get your hair to look like that? You have my word. As a gentleman You got something on your mind? There. Well, there's someone I think might be -- That's because it's such a nice one. Right. See? You're ready for the quiz. Let me see what I can do. That's a shame. Why? Seems like she could get a date easy enough... Cameron. Forget it. Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night? Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you. You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score. No, I ' m not. The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her? Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and - It's her favorite band. Okay! I wasn't sure Her favorite uncle Number one. She hates smokers Will Bogey get bent? This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party. You got him involved? I thought you hated those people. That's what I just said Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not? They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? He seems like he thrives on danger What about him? I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me. That's her? Bianca's sister? You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her? Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada He always have that shit-eating grin? Why do girls like that always like guys like that? Why not? Who is she? That girl -- I -- That I'm used to. How many people go here? Thirty-two. Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though. North, actually. How'd you ? So they tell me... You get the girl. She kissed me. She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote What'd you do to her? Sure She's partial to Joey, not me It's off. The whole thing. Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night. Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion". I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful. And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom. You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class. Hey, sweet cheeks. My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year. It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff. So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week. Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday? It's more And why would I do that? Your sister here? Where ya goin? Not at all They're running the rest of me next month. The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy? Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know. Get her to act like a human How'd you do it? A deal's a deal. Forget it. What? Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date. When I shell out fifty, I expect results. Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation. Fine, thirty. I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend. You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors. But you'd go out with her if you had the cake? You just said Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her. What do you think? You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested. You and Verona? I hear you're helpin' Verona. Does this conversation have a purpose? We're not. We don't chat. Are you lost?Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile. Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress. Extremely unfortunate maneuver. You told me that part already. Assail your ears for one night. He's pretty! Dead at forty-one. It's a lung cancer issue Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass. In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out. Like we had a choice? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca. Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street. You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side. Did she actually say she'd go out with you? I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers. No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz... What makes you think he'll do it? You wanna go out with him? Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point? The mewling, rampalian wretch herself. Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew. You could consecrate with her, my friend. Guess who just signed up for a tutor? You know French? Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class. And a model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out. Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted. I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility. Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it You burn, you pine, you perish? Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood. Couple thousand. Most of them evil Get out! How many people were in your old school? I was kidding. People actually live there? So -- which Dakota you from? C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour. You the new guy? Hey -- it's all for the higher good right? What? We took bathes together when we were kids. Uh, yeah. We're old friend So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job. But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right? Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested. Nope - just came by to chat Hey. Kat a fan, too? Macbeth, right? Oh yeah. Cool pictures. You a fan? Hey there. Tired of breathing? Sweet love, renew thy force! So you got cozy with she who stings? I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows. Ever been to Club Skunk? Just for now. Good enough. We're your guys. Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl. That's where we can help you. With Kat. I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's. The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford. What?Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed? Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in? Always a pleasure, Brucie. What's the worst? Where? You makin' any headway? She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day. I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it. Then, go get her Cameron -- do you like the girl? What 're you talking about? Cameron, I'm a little busy Don't make me do it, man So what does that give me? I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments? What've you got for me? Yeah -- we'll see. I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers. Another hundred for the tux -- Do what? It's about time. Forget her sister, then. A hundred bucks a date. I just upped my price I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image. I'm on it Fifty, and you've got your man. I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks. How much? You're gonna pay me to take out some girl? You need money to take a girl out Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it. Two legs, nice rack... Yeah Don ' t you even dare. . . Because I like to torture you. Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her. Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl. I thought you could use it. When you start your band. I didn't care about the money. It wasn't like that. Wait I... It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook? That's where I was last year. She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of story. My grandmother's . Oh huh It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress? Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company. You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that? So I have to have a motive to be with you? Why not? No what? You know what I mean Go to the prom with me No one else knows You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me. I hate peas. Hearsay. Fallacy. You up for it? You never disappointed me. Then you screwed up So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered? Yes So what's your excuse? A soft side? Who knew? So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way? I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off. Maybe. Forget it. I'm stayin'. Try lookin' at it from this angle I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights. Look up, sunshine So what did I have an effect on ? Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist. Wholesome. Pleasant? I heard there was a poetry reading. Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy. No offense, but you're sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but ... Who? So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass? I'm gettin' there You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission. Start a band? Do what? Then why'd you ask? Maybe. Busy And I'm in control of it. Kat! Wake up! I thought you were above all that I know. It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type. Dorsey. Why'd you let him get to you? See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred? Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me. Sure, I do I told you Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced. What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference... Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep You're not okay. Okay? I say, do what you wanna do. What's this? Why, don't you? You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there. Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me. Excuse me? hey. Great show, huh? You're not a big talker, are you? I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi. Seven-thirty? Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass... Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me. You hate me don't you? I know a lot more than that The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back. Pick you up Friday, then There's a way to get a guy's attention. I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'? Man -- don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you. You were right. She's still pissed. No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose. I'm likin' you guys better Yeah. Are you telling me I'm a - "non-smoker"? What?! You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast? So Dorsey can get the girl? Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash. What is it with this chick? She have three tits? What plan? Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say. Say it See you next week! Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good... What's to discuss? Touch of the flu. It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch. I missed you.I'm missing something. You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story. It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for? The prom? Kat has a date? Because she'll scare them away. Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present. Just for a minute Wear the belly before you go. Oh, God. It's starting. If Kat's not going, you're not going. Otherwise known as an orgy? And where're you going? Exactly my point Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night. No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion. Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check. You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game. No -- impressed. Bianca did what? Which parts? So tell me about this dance. Was it fun? I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to? Funny. Was that your sister? You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it. As a parent, that's my right Why can't we agree on this? Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me? My insurance does not cover PMS Enough! I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0. That ' s what I thought Did I have anything to say about it? What just happened? But -- who -- what --? What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap Kissing? Is that what you think happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day. Pirate -- no question. You're not helping. Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating? Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country. Make anyone cry today?
