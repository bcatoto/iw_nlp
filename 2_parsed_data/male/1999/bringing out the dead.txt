Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug. I love this guy. I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time. I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise. You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls. I'm sorry, Pierce. You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you. I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that? I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons. Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row. Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one. Sorry. I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself. I've never fired anyone in my life. You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate. What am I going to to do with this guy? Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.It's a miracle. Es impossible. Is she dying? She say she in great pain. No, no, that's impossible. No English. She has terrible pain in her belly. We are virgins. Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze. Two years. Ever since we left island.Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen. Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out? Frank, take it easy. what happened? He's not a cop, he's a medic. I'm CY Coates. It's okay, Kanita. Come on in. Mary ... Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot. That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank? What about Kanita? I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place. So, Frank, am I going to live? I can't hold up my head anymore. No! Just take it easy. That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle. Sleep is all stress reduction. Here. You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need. Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health? You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water. Red Death? Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that. That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these. I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories. She wanted something to help her sleep. I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it? Sleeping in the back. Mary said you might be coming.Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A. You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information. I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service. Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you. I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance. Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?IB Bangin. All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days. No way, man. He's going to be all right, right?What if there is no tomorrow? No ... I don't think a week's gonna do it. You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again. You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong. I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard. It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker. I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you. You can trust me on this one. She's having a baby. Twins. Thanks for the translation. What's your name? Nombre? Can you walk? Puedes caminar? Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada? Pregnant. No. Dead. I was tired. I needed a coffee. You're going to live. They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm. Does that hurt? I guess I'll be going. Is this what you gave Mary? I should be going. I just quit. Did you give Mary something called Red Death? Got a beer? Mary, we really have to go. I better just go in and see her. She asked me to pick her up. Where is she? Frank Pierce. The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster. What the hell. The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate. Yeah? No, I'd better not. That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime. Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it. You're not going to die. Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas. Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed. You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that. I can't. I have to stay with my patient. Frank. There's no time. No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody. Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza? No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap. It'll be a while before he's up and running again. He'll be all right. I need to sit down a minute. Because you can barely walk. Mary. Mary, we've got to get going. We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath. Fifteen minutes. You asked me not to come. Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you. Maybe I should come up with you. Okay. Don't seem so bad to me. Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble. Sure. Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest. I think I'd remember that. You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow. Five years. It's been bad lately, but it's always bad. Ah, no. I was. It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too. They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess. We moved out after that. Upstate. I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament. You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago? When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle? It's best not to ... It's good pizza, huh? He's better. That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own. He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign. Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like. I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could. How is she? I think it looks good. You look so different. Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know. Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news. She should go home. He's working a double shift. No. Our Lady of Misery. Yes. Yes. It's okay. They're prescription. Works better with a little whiskey. Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now. Even when you say the things, there's always more things. At least he's got people around him. You never know. The first is always the best. I wouldn't do that. The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder. I guess there's always a chance. We'd better go outside. Quickly. He's very very sick. His heart's beating. Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked. Do you have any music? I quit! I'm through! Greatest job in the world. I'll drink to that. I hate vodka. I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding. You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look. Don't give me that look. Backup? Three legs. It's coming. Hold her down. What's wrong. I need a drink, that's all. She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me. She's no whore, Marcus. What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love. Thanks. I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this. She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving. Make a left here. I want to stop. Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story. He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon. Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date? She hit you with a bottle? I think the worst is over. The ghosts-- The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now. Where's Burke? No. Last show of the night. A medical miracle. What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator? How many times have you shocked him tonight? Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity. The family know? What do you think? That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone. He one of them? He got better. Yes. I'm sorry. He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry. He's dead, Rose. Your father passed. We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right. Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear! Do it! Get the kit! We're gonna tube him! You learn that in the army? That's ridiculous. Okay, whatta I do? He's crazy. He can't help it. What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom. Destruction, distraction. I feel the need. I don't know--let's break some windows. Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something. That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die. Let's get in a fight, then. C'mon, Tom, pick up a job. As long as we keep moving. No standing still. How's he doing? Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then. Better bring it all. It's early for him. I never felt better in my life. I've taken that into consideration. I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself. C'mon, Tom. The city's burning. Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it? The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital. Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso. Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me. These are hard times, Tom. I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure. Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got. It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering. No way! One more time! You sure? Used to be my partner. You really think so? Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else? Yeah, you're right. Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight. I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night. Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls. Faster! Well why didn't you say so? They'll just keep calling. Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk. Mr. Oh. Don't push it, Larry. You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe. What? I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet. I'm not hungry. What? I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job. No we can't. He's got a pulse.Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more. Crazy fucker. Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp! Anybody else hurt? That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it? Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours. You can't believe how much he's improved. Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart? Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months? I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone. Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints. Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin. No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks. I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone. Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.Stomach again. You're in the stomach! Let me try. You're in the stomach! Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker. He's crazy. Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots. You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here. You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that. Relax, will you. Faster! God! He's drunk. Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh. It's not our job to taxi drunks around. It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it. You're burned out. That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank. You know what. The radio. Turn it off. Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on. Oh yeah, you don't eat food. I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting? Oh no!--I just remembered. Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd. The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink? No shit. Ten-four. Don't go. Not this time. Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it. You can do that for me at least. Three Zebra. Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there? Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else. No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing. You see, he's giving it to us anyway.No underwear? In that time, you ever have sex? You know each other a long time? Ten-four. Let's do it! It's Marcus, Love, only for you. Ten-four, hon. Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me. She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio. Ten-four, hon. This is for you. I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good. Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival. What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin? What's his name? He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it. No. He's dead. Okay, what happened? You can't leave me now. Where you going? Here's to the greatest job in the world. Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking. We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way. What look? It's coming. That's too many. What's that, Frank? Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first. No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift. We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me. Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you. You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out. Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad. Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand? Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up. God help us, he's hungry too. Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought. Who's that? No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him. I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside? He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back. She loves me the way no woman ever has. She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy. It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy? Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last. My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?Oh man, Bucky. Sure, sure, give go. Here, you try. Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy. Me. I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series. What did you say? Oh man, do you mean that? Thank you man, thank you. How? No, no medicine! See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert. Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh. Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra. You're going out of service in two seconds. Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time. Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks. One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.You're crazy. Frank! Frank! Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better. If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him. Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us-- Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again. This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him. Let me think. You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy. Why? What do you want to break? Who with? You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call. C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood! Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight! I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty. I don't think the fire people can touch him out there. Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out. Whadda we bring? That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it. Mr. Oh. You okay? The brakes are shot. Whatja doing? Where you going? Look out! Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto. Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off. Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives. Yeah. Great, isn't it? Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets. No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
