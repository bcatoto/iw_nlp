$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less. You got no choice on that. Hid it from my mom. Caught a mess a sea runs. Damn thing's still in my closet. I am a bastard. I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch. And I still got your bamboo fishing rod. ... might do the same. I have to warn you 'bout that, chief. I'm not screwed together like I used to be. Seven acres. I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em. Just curious, is all. Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...I'm a hemotologist, not a detective. I don't know. I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t... None. Bits of blood and wood. What else would there be? That's obvious. No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males. Carl Heine's type.Well, it does seem mighty warm in here. Specially for Mr. Hooks. Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in advance ? That Carl loses two batteries. Must happen once ever' 20 years or so. You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him? Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog. Boat has two batteries. Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his. No sense to have any at all., even the right size. It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car. Nobody does. Couldn't get on the boat. I'd just shoot the feller. Then tie up, throw him inta th' drink. And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding. It's a joke. Maneuver up to Carl's boat? Tie your lines fast? Come aboard? All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of. Unwritten rule of the sea. We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.Did he see some danger from defen... When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this? What do you mean by 'dirty looks'? And when he came home. Did he write you about this? Or phone, perhaps. Now defendant's father had also died by that point. Where was the defendant? When you sent his family their equity. Why? If they could never take title. But back in '34, Japanese-born could not own land. So...? So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then. I said. No further questions. Question withdrawn, you may step down. Doesn't it seem to you , Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful? Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation. Well, it seems to me... So you hid the truth. Deliberately. But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about? Why not? Up in the air? Was that your reaction? And then, something did. Carl Heine was found dead. With his head crushed. You thought the deceased might... break his promise? So, five hours. Plenty of time for a call. He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'. Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock? So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news. Yes? You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news? And your evaluation of the defendant? Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle? Well, what then, sergeant? So. Wide cross-section of men to evaluate. And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration. Did you find him eager? And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat. And replaced it later with the new one. That's your inference? So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat. With that last one. Would those cleats have lined up? And the last...? And the next one...? So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two. And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound. Could you tell me what 'kendo' is? And why. Is that? Did you say more? ...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head. Tht was summation, Your H... You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f... All right. What did your son say to that effect? Objection, asking the witness to speculate. Were you, sir? Can you prove one word of all your fancy story? And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful. At a tactic that insults their intelligence. I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h... Greedy. Your line of work. You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth. But isn't the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces. And since you confess this is all pure guesswork. What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts? Well, the freighter. The twine. The blood. The knife. The cup. The watch. The second battery. The phantom lantern. The fishing gaff. The cracked gunnel. The skull wound. The blond hair. That's eleven things... Everything had to happen just right. For your little story to fly. I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons. Objection! Speculation. But Carl was a fisherman. And successful at it. And then your stroke came this summer. And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7. Which, remember, is eight days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy? Mr. Jurgensen. Did he offer to buy the seven acres from you? Robbed. He was angry. Well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well. If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible? Didn't go anywhere else? No errands, no purchases? Just straight to the boat. That's the truth. I see. Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found? Before your arrest. You mean, this morning. The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth? That's a question, sir. My apologies. Do you regret not telling the truth? Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the truth . Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir. You'd been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed ignorance! But even after you had an attorney. You still claimed to know nothing . Claimed not to have seen Carl. Am I correct? Actually, she said you had decided. Decided not not come forward.I did. But the jury won't s... Look, I want to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again. There's no one here, and I've got to talk to you. The Japs did it. I couldn't say anything. I just stood there, hating her. We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t... It's just Pearl Harbor. People are a little crazy, right n... It'll be over soon. I can get you money. There can't be any wrong in this, Ha... Well, I don't do it for just anybody. Why? We're only talking. Your friends would. Your dad would kill me with a machete. The best part was that there was a 'this'. To debate the wrongness of. I told myself that was good. That it made our friendship special. And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily. At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me. As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret. ...but he found you. Those aren't the facts that matter. Seattle boys think he's guilty. They say the evidence is rock solid. I felt Milholland's report in my pocket. And wondered why I wasn't telling her. Telling someone. What I'd found. Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma. We just don't pretend we know. No, sir, I can't. Not beyond a reasonable doubt. That's curious. I was appealing to their intelligence. That's how journalists. Answer questions. He didn't want to lose any more. Like you couldn't believe. Oh, yes. Then putting them together. So truth is revealed. My expertise. Is that I'm a journalist. Twelve. I'm sorry, was there a question in there? Maybe it went. Where Carl went. Over the side. Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever. No one knows. You mean, early morning the 16th? How long you have this detail? And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em. You have the night watch? On the radio. It's on the twine, too. But it's not r... You're right. I better use two. Have a look. At nothing. It's public record. If the public cares enough to read it. Won't take two. Three kids. What's she going to do? We don't let go, you s... You ever been strangled by a single hand? Cigarette? The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely. We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. Just below the mast. He hit his head. On the way in. The freighter started through at 1:42. The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47. Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife? Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working. Same report Milholland heard. And that makes him get the lantern fast. Before the freighter's wake can bang it around. Coincidences happen. You run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere. Split-second tragedy happens every day. Or maybe... He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. So he climbs up. To cut it down. Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left. Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing. But at some point, he thinks of the lantern... That's when he fell. Because the second lantern, the one on the mast. Was never found. So we have to ask... That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case. Well. It shows the prosecutor was wrong. It was Carl's boat that was dead in the water. Or he'd never have put up the lantern. To my father. Everything counts. Yes, he was. You're wondering why I held it. It's the way it happened, I know it is.Pretty darn clear. You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat. Found on Carl's boat, too. Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's. perfect. From Carl Heine's boat. All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not bowlined like Miyamoto's. ...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side. And it's brand new. Unlike the rest. These are fishermen, Alvin. They don't talk at all to each other and less to me. Specially gossip. Nossir. I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine. Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin. You gonna climb that with one arm? Here now, what are you fixin' to do? Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place. You said three minutes. I did. Boy. Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there. In a half hour you could be in Canada. You gaff with the hook end. Blood's on the butt. Where your hand goes. Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover, willya? See you replaced a mooring line, lately. This one's new. You always run with the well open? We have a warrant. To search your boat. You said that. That was your testimony. What else could it be? One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck. The damage was considerable. But she's insured. Thanks, again. She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking. Possible. But not darn likely. He was heavy, but we were real careful. But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere. I don't think so. I believe so. Apparently. No. Two D-6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for. It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it. He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting. You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6. It is. A little. Yes. You have to wonder. Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd. Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog. Maybe. Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. And forgot the cup....or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable? With no bone or scalp or hair present. Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull... You don't. Well, if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a man's skull... No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair? You scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff. Where a fella's hand goes. And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...? And the blood could not have belonged to defendant. Seeing that his type is O negative. But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his. So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all. It was human , yes? Type B positive. It is. So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it? If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500. Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre? Just three questions. The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500? Thank you, Mr. Gillanders. Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather. Well, what if? All right, what if the defendant heard ? So Carl let him aboard, to help. And then the fishing gaff? Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work. So how would he signal for help? Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare. Even though it was too large f... So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense? I'm sorry about that. It wasn't mine in the first place. Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff? Now, Mister Gi... Your Honor, all of this is speculation. Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call. Objection! Objection. Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind. My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that? As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake? It's a rare thing. Takes a turning point. Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes. If I whistle. Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'. You're the story today. I'll take two. One for later. Well, anything coulda caused that. You think so? Still and all. Carl was a strong swimmer, he m... Still a coincidence. Timing and all. The knife. What knife? But you could be wrong. He could have climbed up earlier. Maybe...? Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence? Still lashed to the mast. Fell. Well, why does it? Now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand. The second lashed to the mast. Tell us why that lantern would be so significant. He's looking down. And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday. He's proud of the man you are tonight. That's what counts. Your daddy. Was quite a feller. I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones. in the middle of the night. This tastes horrible, hmmn? No, you don't. I told your wife. Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks believe is true. That's sad. And it's real. I want you. To tell the truth. You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is first -degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge. That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said. Gave him the battery. Like you said. Asked him about the seven acres. Like you said. So every time you think about showing that jury strength. Or honor or composure. Or dignity. Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth... You're wonderin'...how come I never ask. If you did it. Bet there's a few things you could teach me. Kendo, for one. I think you like learning. White or black? Your daddy played. I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars? Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare. Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare. And her farmhouse...? How is your mother-in-law? Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it possible . Possible that he struck his head after death. Possible? You don't. Remember . You don't. Think so. Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in? Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net. I'm curious. The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's? So the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn? No spare. Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat? But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there. Why not use that? Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery. A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8. It would be too large for the deceased's well. You found three batteries, you say. A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct? You have to wonder. Does it now? And yet you started the engine right up. With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. Did that strike you odd? I think you testified all the lights were on. Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights... Right. In the middle. Of the floor. Are you absol... Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand. The report says 'recent origin'. How recent? As much as 24 hours before death? But you are certain that he died by drowning. And that you can't say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death? Is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was. Is it possible? So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have... Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around? Or would both look the same. In your motorcycle example. Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. Rather than the reverse, yes? Your report says death by drowning , which means he went into the water alive and breathing. And the report is accurate...? Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard. So this...foam you found in the lungs. How does it get there? The question is more about the defendant's attitu... Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques... You can speak for what he said . Just like you did for Mr. Hooks... Carl ever say he got one? Those 'dirty looks'. Defendant ever aim one of those at you? Of course not. But it was emotional. A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude. I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate. So the defendant was encouraged to hope. Or could have been. Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed. So your husband said he's think it over. Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...He said he didn't want that life no more. He'd been saving to buy a farm. He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place. Carl Heine came. Oh, yeh. But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell. Oh, yeh. He said someday he would get his land back.Japanese stick-fighting. They're trained as kids, y'know. To kill with sticks. Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war. I saw those kendo wounds, many times. Looked exactly like this one. I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person. With a bloody gun- butt. A right-handed fella, to be precise. He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?' And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?' Yes , I'm sure. Absolutely not. Probably one or two hours. Four at the most. Can I say something, here? For the third time, yes. For certain, no. I already said that, b... Sure, anything's poss... If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be. The same. Obviously. Well... That's why the autopsy report identifies drowning as the cause of death. As I testified. It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration. I believe I said that.
