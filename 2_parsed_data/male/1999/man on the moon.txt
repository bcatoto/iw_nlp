Yeah! He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing! He rubs you and sucks the disease right out! Ehhh, you know those guys. If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day. And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer. My hair is coming out. I can't move my arm. Then he'll borrow it. I know Tony better than you do. Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it! Tony Clifton. I don't care about the money. I just want the show to deliver. No clubs. I wanna reach the TOP! Carnegie Hall...! I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. The best show anybody's ever seen! Y-yeah? Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead. Of course! But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support! I can't be surrounded by negative energy. It's visualization therapy. He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease. I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma. No, it's true. I have lung cancer. The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want... Hey! Our first phone call! Hello? Maybe I can turn it into a bit. I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged. Demand a recount... We were just trying to push the envelope -- What, you don't think I can beat him? That's because they've only seen it once. But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN... They'll catch on! They're having a laugh... That means it was a success. I woke up the audience -- like punk rock! Here, take this. George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them. But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do. 'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them. But wasn't it funny? Oh dear! George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break. Oh no! Did he get hurt? Oh, you know the Bay Area! Always foggy! Hi, George! Good to hear from you! How long would they let me sleep? But George, I like to push the boundaries... I'm sorry, George... Okay... I'll go back. But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka. They're gettin' Tony! Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!" The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special! What's up? Of course. But only on Monday nights. Hi George! He's a Vegas entertainer. I used to do impressions of him. We sorta... got in a fight over that. Those are my terms. Okay. Fine, I'll do it. But I have a few terms. I refuse. I'm not interested. I want to create my own material. I told you, I'm not a comedian. And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter. No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good. No. George, I hate sitcoms. I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO! The Fonzie! The crazy breakout character! The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes! Sitcom...? The stewardess let me keep my headphones. I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall. I'm not a comedian. I have no talent. I'm a song-and-dance man. It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea. It sunk. GEORGE Oh. Hm. I'm uh, sorry. Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting. If you ever need representation... we should talk. No. Caspiar. Tank you veddy much. I don't swear. I -- I don't do what everyone else does! What do you want? "Take my wife, please"?? You're firing me?? You don't even pay me! So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...? But that's it. I needed you to believe! Our family will be in the newspapers. People will look, and they'll be touched. Because your emotions were honest! Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. It didn't hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head in. Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. It didn't hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head in. B-but I have them. But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five. Oh! Maybe I should talk to the natives. Shoom boom boo ba! Shoom boom boo ba -- These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials. Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis... Right... Deal. Twenty! But it's only for thirty seconds! But it's funny! It's a practical joke. They'll get frustrated! I've never understood that. It's just... getting dark. But I like you! Hey! Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED??? What do you mean? No no no, it's not sex! I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling. Do you wanna wrestle? It's a good way of breaking the ice. That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together. Okay. You're probably right. Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks. No, NO! Not yet. I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times. They don't know... they've gotta run more tests. You don't know the real me. I don't deserve Haagen Daz. I'm a horrible person. Oh, it's open. Go away. I-I'm sorry. I got caught up in the action...! I can shtop whenever I want... Ooo, the little lady's upset. Well I say -- get back in the kitchen! If you want... Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world! I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me! Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win! Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show! What do you say??? Yes. Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married? Oh! Uh, I hope I didn't offend you. Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond." I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter. Popcorn? No, I'm sure we'll be fine. Hi... Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond." I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter. Popcorn? No, I'm sure we'll be fine. Hi... Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously. It was just part of the show! It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd. Gosh, you scored! Look at all those goodies! DON'T TOUCH ME! I said I didn't want to do the sketch. But I don't do drugs! And I don't enjoy making light of them! I was promised creative control! You're not listening to me -- I'm not comfortable with the last sketch. I DON'T do drug humor! And you're just poor white trash! My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --! T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me -- And you're just poor white trash! My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --! T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me -- No! NO NO NO! None of that! I want this show to be positive! Well, call SAG. It'd be cool to get one on the show. I want the evening to build and build. It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down! This is great. The crowd's gonna love this! Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive? I was very original! Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers -- I, I was asked to do this material - - Sir, do you have a problem? It's a rave! Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me. You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler... Look at this! An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty! Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy! Boy, they totally fell for it! I'm only acting crazy! It's so dirty. I dunno about this... What will my mother think? They're asking for it. Give me the book. So? What do they know? Each show is worse than the next. I'm gonna quit. Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda. Bob and I have been buddies for years. So HELP ME! All I wanna do is MEDITATE!! Please! You've GOT to let me take the classes! It's how I keep myself BALANCED!! "Philosophically"? Why?? I... I attend every year. Yes, your Holiness? I stopped drinking. I gave up drugs. And I'm meditating three hours a day. It's the center of my life... Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here. Doctor, I think I need a neck brace. But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough... Are you sure?Sure it is. Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me! Why's that? You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman -- I'll take my chances!! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know! Wink wink! Nudge nudge! Eh, sure. We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman. Oh.Get off my stage! You're fired! Yeah!! I talked to Andy Kaufman! We had a deal!! Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry. But -- I need your permission to fire him.Really? Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work? Yeah... You've got good days and bad days. You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money. So who's gonna pay for it? Do you wanna tour the clubs? So how can I help you...? Andy, you're surrounded by what you create. You are the KING of negative energy. You must take a little pleasure in it. What was that all about? That's ridiculous. You don't even smoke. Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you. Andy... it's me. I've got some crummy news. Taxi's been canceled. Andy! You don't get it! They don't want you back. You're BLIND! There is no envelope anymore!! It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution -- I don't want you two to ever work together again. He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion. He'll kill you. First, you piss-off women. Then you piss-off the South. Then you get killed! And I did the bookings. Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore? Where's that sweet guy who used to do "Here I come to save the day!"? Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality! WRONG! You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody! No, I'm not gonna take it. If I take it I'll break my back. But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life. It's obsessive. Nothing's ever on the level anymore. "Funny"? I dunno. But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure. Like, that moment, when you both came onstage... You're so proud. You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!" There'll be other shots. I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony. Hi, Andy. How's the weather up there? I don't know! Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain? The audience... or yourself? And that's great. But do it in LA and New York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! I don't care! When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude. If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse! You give 'em Elvis!! You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry! And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him! You signed for five years -- So four years, seven months. Tell you what. I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it -- Look, I'm sorry. They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like -- Andy! That's alright. Where...? Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere? Andy? They're IMPOSSIBLE!! Jesus! I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??! Who is this TONY CLIFTON?! Are you makin' fun of me --? This is RIDICULOUS! Of course! That's what negotiations are for. LISTEN, you arrogant putz! I've been in this business for twenty years! I know! If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!! You have to do it. B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha-- Andy... this is every comedian's dream. "No"? "No" to which part?? HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part! ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into -- "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!! And this is a CLASS ACT! It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows! It takes place in a taxi stand! And you're gonna be the Fonzie! That's... terrific! But I got something better. This is BIG... You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!! Andy, c'mon IN! Thanks for flyin' out here!! You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you. You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself? People love... comedians. Caspiar? I haven't heard of that. So I understand you're from Lithuania? Hey, I really enjoyed your set. Yeah, I KNOW what I said! But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen! Gene, you misunderstood!! You're not getting BOTH of them! It's physically impossible! No, I'm serious. If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY. Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman. Really?! You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe?? Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos. The audiences don't work well for him. Look... I don't know what your problem is... Who is this? TONY CLIFTON You -- you know damn straight who it is. Tony Clifton! A name to respect. A name to fear. Beer. Gear. Deer. Ear. Can I help you with something? Er, yes. Speaking. It's a perfect Kaufman audience. If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you. FORGET IT. It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this. Why...? Andy, why...? Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback. God, listen to this! "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..." But what's the POINT? How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world? So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe. You... and you. Bob, Andy needs to RELAX. See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special. Something nice... I'm worried about Andy. His stress level is affecting his work. So your name's not Gorsky.GET OFF! Go to commercial, man! Get off the stage! Don't worry! The kids will love it -- Andy, it'll be fine! It's what we're known for! "Maui? "Wowie!"Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'! Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel." Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material... Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting. But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records... Eh, I dunno... Andy. I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...Cue the commercial! Okay, great! So let's reset! Ten. Five. Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program. Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair. They might change the channel.It's probably just a strained muscle. Positive. I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.A -- a tourist. It's my name. Yes. Bob Gorsky. Bob. Sure...Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!! For all we knew, you were DYING! Look at your mother -- she's still shaking! B-but... we saw... your neck... B-but... we saw... your neck... No! That is NOT an audience! That is PLASTER! An audience is people made of flesh! They -- live and breathe! Got it?! You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone. You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience! Andy! Why isn't he MOVING?? They're gonna lynch him! Who knows?! That kid is totally meshuga. He said he's coming back! Where? Is he in his room?I GOT A CONTRACT!! I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR! I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman. He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places. I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else -- "Burlesque"? Kaufman's a lying bastard! If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU! Yeah! You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you! "Speaking"! Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking! Uh, yeah. Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO? See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about! Here! I'LL give you a little humor! SHUT UP! I hate them Polish jokes! Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor? Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant! "Gorsky"? What is that, Polish? "Bob"? BOB! Bob bob bob. Bob what? What's your name?Andy, don't raise your voice. We don't wish your presence here. It is apparently not working. The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual. It seems you have no respect for anything. Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM. But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically. This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat. Excuse me, Andy... We are all impressed. Goals are important. Are you at peace with your family?And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?" And he says, "Cancer!" I dunno. If they were, they'd be pushin' 80. Yeah, exactly -- "was"! But now, you're creatively bankrupt. In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!! I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine. Isn't that true??? Who gives a shit?! It's not funny! Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap. Kaufman, people are sick of you. The wrestling... the hoaxes... Yeah, my problem is you're tired. It's working for Elvis. "... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis. His parents are at his bedside. Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"... No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it. These he- men'll kick your ass!! They're huge! What is this, World War Two...? "Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?" Nah. The girls sponge off between johns. She'll say, "Now my son is a man." No! Andy, don't do it -- Absolutely nothing! That's the beauty! It's credibility. You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads! Are you nuts?! 40 million people watch you every week! What?!? Hey Andy, good show. Yeah. They don't know whether to be sad, or angry. What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?! I was the one saying I didn't believe it! Hey, that's good! We can make that play. And we'll really drag it out. You get better, you get worse... you die... I used to think you were original. Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity! Sure! But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony. I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head! Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon? Maybe that'll chill him out. Don't believe everything you hear. That was a really hot house!
