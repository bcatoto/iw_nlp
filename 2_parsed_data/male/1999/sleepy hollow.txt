He came to me. He promised great violence. Said I should cast you out for my own protection. I must speak honestly. There is no reason to think he will not meet with success. Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting. This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse. Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl. Her things are gone. Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town. What about breakfast, woman? Or, am I to starve to death? Hail, Constable. How are you? Must have been the Redman. A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods. Many have. This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it? Am I mistaken?I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this... You must have missed your mark. Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side. They spend two days in chains. Never. A shoe that size I would have remembered. What the hell are you doing? We haven't heard your name yet, friend. Certainly not.What? What of it? ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed. It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves. You need rest. You need to sleep. He is dead. You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut. Keep still, Constable. You were half-drowned when they found you. I do not care. You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place. A diseased monster. The Lenape. He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time. We must be a curious sight to him. What is that? To place it inside its coffin. I was afraid of this. Excuse me?You cannot do this. I am a man of God! Damn you, sir! God damn you to hell! They need guidance. I am the Lord's voice in this town. Are you a deist? Is that it? A free thinker who does not believe in divinity. No. You will not run me out. No one will believe a word of what you say. For poaching. Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost? Your superiors are two days away! I will not allow it. I will not! It is sacrilege! The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all. Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm? How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?Excellent. Then, you are excused till morning. Just so. Granted. And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place. Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me? These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application. There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands. It is named Sleepy Hollow. Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off. The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you. For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism. Very few, if any. And, with disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure. Have they nothing to fear presently? Must we again hear these heretical rantings? He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health. He drowned. Anyone could see.How did you hear this? Um... I... I did not... no. Why? Well enough. Your gathering does honor to the deceased. These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there. Who took the meat? Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes. Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman? If we could speak alone. I hit him square. I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing. Two days... ? For murder? You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large? Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine. Excuse me, Miss... They have a laugh at your expense. When this cut was made, this person was already dead. This is not Lady Van Tassel. No clotting or gathering of pus. No healing at all. Stains of blood. Would you stay, doctor? I may need assistance. You will stay at her side? Bring him. Bring Young Masbath here. ... Brom Bones... In time, doctor. Soon as I finish. The wounds are the same. Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head. Have you seen, doctor... ? Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter. He is a behemoth. What are you spying on? This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ? Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow.... No bleeding. Why did you move the body, Doctor? I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts? An honor, gentlemen. In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be? Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father. That is the closest you ever come to God. You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night. He may. But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf. Wallowing quite literally in blood. Wallowing in sin and lust... It is only important what you are. An adulterer... Oh? Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here. Only if I repeat them outside this room. And, I will if I must... Out there, for all to hear. Or... you may speak, as planned. But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures. Does that look like an animal hanging? Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today. Protest to my superiors if you like. I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims. All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies... Perhaps, I could assist in finding them? Master Hardenbrook... Maybe you should take this. May we look at them now? May I see them, Master Hardenbrook? Yes, sir... but, do you have these? Do you have these persons' wills? Just a moment... Are you saying it is he? Pardon me? I shall, gladly. Not for lack of trying. Chosen me? Not Liberalism. Equanimity. Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally? But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets? Without disrespect, look around you. We overflow. As do our courts. Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement. I could determine if he were dead before he went into the Hudson. There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs... Just a moment... if I may. It is possible this man was murdered. Is that all you say? Look at her. Tell me something. What becomes of Young Masbath? More than enough, actually. I beg you, no more, please. At times I do. Listen to what you say.... I know it. Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck? Well... so much for common sense. What is that you wear? Believe? Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover? The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants. And the Widow Windsor was next... The militia? How are you? I doubt that's the end. Take the reins. I know. Hold on. Climb up! I cannot. You should not worry. Van Ripper and his wife will look after you. They will. You will be well cared for. This is farewell. You do not know all that has happened. You cannot understand. Nothing. To hell with this place and all the people here. I need time for thinking. Without you hanging on my coattails for a change. Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill. Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church. Find her at all costs. Quickly. Fiction plays and novels. Baltus does not approve. Now, come. It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns. It is nothing. She comes to read books, so her father will not find her. It is absolutely nothing. Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it. Did you find the victims' loan agreements? Lady Van Tassel. There are none for Magistrate Philipse either. "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William." Did your father take a loan? Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts? Intestate. Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one. No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone intestate. Only the heirs were killed. Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment. And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus. I heard him say it. To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place. Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul. We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted. What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths? Business, best hidden is hidden best at night. Man or woman? Why this tree? Must be some sort of gateway. But, why this place... ? Stay back. Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply. True enough. You grow sharper by the minute, little man. It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others. "Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it? I admit not being anxious to find out. "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives. We are far from the Hollow. Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning. We should not go much further in this murk. How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention? We are leaving. I hear nothing. What is it? Witches do not exist. However... If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves. Now, hold the bowl steady. Back to business. I have others. All I need is this. Yes... I suppose it is. Keep it. Not for eating, I assure you. Watch here. Are you familiar with magnets? Look again. Out there. What do you see? What is it? Up. His teeth. Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth. The Lenape could not have done that for himself. Someone out there cared for him. The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth. We must discover it. The reason the murderer chose these persons. What is the common thread between these victims? Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss. It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now. I manage fine alone. I am not here for revenge. I am here to bring justice. We have no choice. The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me. No. Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump. Keep climbing. I will follow... His horse. He moves too fast. I do not know. Away. Katrina... The name Van Tassel is blackened. You share that name. What would you have me believe? The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms. They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now. What did he say, Katrina? And, what did he say? It was you there? Come with me. What... what are you doing... ? Yes. I did notice that, thank you. Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside? He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass. Just... keep where you are. Blood. A woman should not be out alone in these woods. Katrina. Why do you follow? I... I do not know. I no longer know what I think or what I feel. Memories have come back. I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now. Lord, how I hate this place. What happened to your mother? Is she still alive? She is not your birth mother, is she? Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she? She bears so little resemblance. No, actually, you were not. Every word you spoke had truth in it. Allow me some time. I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone. If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it. Not for a moment. So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours. And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber. To avenge his father, and the others. I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it. It was not butchery. There was no blind stabbing. This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother. The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing. The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly. You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword. I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes. No stone may be left unturned. It may appear harsh... They have done nothing of the sort. If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I? Very well. But, it will only sit gathering dust. Thank you. No. Here... If you want. But... Yes, but listen. The illusion is easily explained. The eye retains each image, till they combine. And yet, some would call this toy magic. He only appears to be inside the cage. The point being... Here it is. A bird on one side. His cage on the other. Now, stare at it. The bird seems to be in his cage. I have had them since childhood. I cannot remember what from. I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment. May I ask... why do you cover your book that way? Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions. There is no such thing as magic. Are you so superstitious? Extra ordinary, yes. But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman. Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once. The massive fellow... Brom. For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy. Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat. Small talk. Excuse me... I should apologize. I, um... I... have no great love of... Feel free to form your own opinion. Though it appears you already have. Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds? I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel. Let her go! What... ? It is fine. Now, I must... It appears well. It has already clotted. Very little. I must be going... Where? Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room. Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here. Yes, actually. It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical. Van Ripper... do you have a gun? Turn around. Now! Van Ripper, turn the coach about! There was not much blood, was there? To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall? Van Ripper. Can you show where the body lay? What... what are you doing? Can you help? The Horseman. Yes. The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him? The Redman? I should tell you... he has been murdered. In a way, yes. Pardon. You did not answer when I knocked. Are we intruding?It's not something people speak of openly. She did not remarry. The Widow Windsor. Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him. They have children and a good home and good land. No, sir, no. If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass. Master Crane, sir. I'm glad we have time alone. You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.Close your mouth! Keep silent. You want to see into the nether world... I can show you. Whatever you see, do not move or speak. I will hold him. Sit. I hear him. He rides to the Hollow and back. Leave me. You are not welcome here. You are from the Hollow?No, you listen! You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards... We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables. Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson. Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse. For stealing a horse! And, you dig up our dead. My talisman. It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face. But, I cannot run. If I run in fear, it is worthless. ... found the body this morning. You do believe now, don't you? He would not have gone into the Western Woods. No sane man would. And now Jonathan Masbath. Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected. We sent for the militia.She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession. Do you know what confession is? All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul. She has confessed. She is guilty. You do not want to be here. Go home to your father. Go home.Yes. Here... What did you say? I didn't see none. Here... in front of this oak, facing north. Horrible... I can show exactly.No. No, sir, please... she is innocent... She did not do it... please listen... May I see my mother?Tired. What now? What can we do? Lady Van Tassel... Take me with you. There's nothing left for me here. Why... why are you like this? Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you? She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir? Sir? What now? Where is she? But, sir... what books? Where are they? What books? There are no other doors. This is as far as she could have gone. No. They are all missing. What was she doing? I was getting worried. Who was it? There is no Masbath here. My father's loan papers are missing. Yes. I rode with him on payment days. Baltus Van Tassel. What does it mean? In test... what? But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away? Yes. My father had farm land. It was the only thing we owned of any value. What good is this? If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet? All I saw was their lantern. Someone left last night. Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest. We should go. What is it? Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And why? Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you. If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian. Someone only tried to make it look that way. What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place? Should we go back? Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. To the tree of the dead. Maybe we passed it by. What happened? No crickets or cicadas calling. No bird songs. Listen. Father said witches live there. Thank you. No, I couldn't... It's spectacular. What kind of nuts? The Western Woods. It's payment day. Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month. Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers. Where are we going? How could he? I'm sure I don't know. I did not ask you to, did I? I deserve to help you. Don't you see how much this means? My father... he... he was a good man... Whatever. You still need a second to tend to your things.
