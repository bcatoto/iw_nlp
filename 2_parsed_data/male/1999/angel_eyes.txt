'67 Chevy Impala. Needs a servicing. Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my coffee again! You didn't like his hair, or what? Y'know... since we're both walking the same way, I could take one of those bags for you. That way, I do some upper body work while I'm walking along. Helps my back. What d'you say? Right now your mind's making pictures of me robbing your groceires, but, y'know, nine times out of ten, people do the right thing. It's the dog food that makes it so heavy. I guess it's worth it... for a good dog. If you're going to put me away, you gotta give me one sweet touch. That ain't the touch.   That ain't the touch I want. As I remove your cuffs, I want you to put your hands here. Spread your legs. More. That's it.   Back off, John, we got it. You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue? And you don't see a pattern here? I want you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it. All right? Are you taking notes? You broke his nose. And you were waiting for him. You were hoping. You were making long-range plans for his ass while he was mouthing off in the car -- and you're supposed to be above that shit. Pogo, stop the shit. What is it? You pissed off at me, too? She doesn't worry about that. Got some action, huh?    Well, that's promising. What did you say? What's the point of blasting your music through the whole zip code? Don't you realize there are kids trying to sleep in these apartments -- old people, sick people? You better watch your mouth, asshole. Why?   What're you gonna do?   Kill me? Guy's nuts.   Let's go. He's not here. I'm okay. Growin' fast. He's got Kathy's looks and brains and my strong back. You should feel his grip. You just passing by? What's happening? We're workin' on Dad. We think you should be there. We told him. We mentioned it. You want to come? You two were always head to head. I don't think it's a good idea you coming around here in uniform. People see it, they think we're in trouble here. Break-in alarm. One suspect in -- nobody out. Take the back. Gun! Hey!     Wait! You got him? He was armed. Jesus. Citizen took him down. No shit!? What happened here? I... just saw it and... I saw the gun, so... You all right, Pogo? I was just walking by.      I live near here. Sergeant's going to want to talk to you, Mr. Lambert. We'll need a statement. Don't worry about it. That's just procedure. Look -- we appreciate what you did. No bullshit. Let us buy you a drink tonight, all right? You know where the Rib House is? What day is today? No. Met somebody today. A woman. No. She's a police officer. No.   No trouble. I saw her once a long time ago. She looks the same. Beautiful. Yeah. My wife's got him in agility class. No shit. 'Rex.' Rex is good. I wonder who the first person was to name a dog 'Fido,' and what the hell does it mean? I got a big question for you, Pogo -- but I can only ask it when we're alone. I happen to know Ray's wife is busy tonight. Why doesn't your partner ever come out with us? I'm a family man. Where are you going? She's just gonna freshen up her makeup. You're wearing makeup? I don't talk to a lot of people. Would you...? I guess I live on the beat you patrol. He was going to shoot you. I figure... it was worth the risk. Yeah -- and for what you do. I think cops are great. Out there, trying to keep it safe. You know? Tough job. Firemen are everybody's heroes. Kids wave at firemen. People should wave at cops. Did you ever think about how many people are walking around this town because you saved them? ... because you helped them or because you arrested somebody who would've hurt them or because you just... did your job? Where do you want to be ten years from now? Somebody taught that to me. Kind of a shortcut. You ask somebody, what are your plans for tomorrow -- what're your dreams for ten years from now. It's supposed to get things started. I never tried it. No. Really. I just remembered it -- God is my witness. The shortcut. Tibet? Hey, Pogo -- don't keep him all to yourself. Come on over, Lambert, join the group. We'll buy you dinner, give you a medal for saving Pogo's ass. Oh.     I'll... walk you to your car. Thanks for the drink. Least we could do. We don't like her very much -- but we don't want to lose her. Take care. I don't have a car. Oh, thanks, but... I like to walk. Can you drive okay? Y'know, I can picture you in Colorado. Driving around... pissed off. Give me some time. What? Whew. I feel like we're boxing, and you've got me on the ropes. We'll do whatever you want. I guess we were supposed to meet. No thanks. I'm circling awhile. So... it's more real this way. Now that I'm in here, you seem mad about it. You first. Some people say we each give off a particular odor -- that can only be detected by one other person's brain. I have no idea. I'm more in the destiny school, we-met-in-another-life school. Do you believe that? Do you think when we die -- we come back in another form? See?   Now you're thinking about me. Does that mean I'm going? You okay now? Is this the mad part? Can I come back some time? Must be the smell. I better go. That's my car!     What the hell were you doing? Nothing.    I just... I saw you!    What did you take out of there?! No, I rolled up the window.       It's rain... You take my phone?!       Hah?! Hey!   Hey!    Wake up!    Wake up! I helped you. I helped you. I'm sorry. Oh.   Sorry. It's me. We made a date. Come back? What makes you think I'd come back here? I'm here to tell you that when you tell someone you're going to be somewhere then that someone rearranges his life and you should be more aware of that and a lot more considerate instead of just... What?   None of your business. You think you deserve coffee? You definitely don't deserve food. I've got coffee, sugar, sweetener, non-dairy... What's the difference? Somebody who keeps appointments. I'm not. You don't believe me?   Give me back the coffee. Give me the coffee. My name is Catch Lambert. I don't work. I don't commit any crimes. I like being with you. We can start from here -- from now. And I need to start from here. That's the way it is. My rules. Yeah. Except for you -- the way I feel about you. Surprising.    I thought it was impossible.    I thought I was... Dead.   In a way. No. Did you ever wonder what 'scratch' meant, when people say, 'we'll start from scratch'? This is scratch. We can start from here. Tell her what? Nora... Nora! She's tough. That doesn't matter. I'm sorry I yelled at you. Sharon... Anything bothering you? Nothing. I'm talking about your general attitude lately. Family matters getting to you? Your brother, Larry... You know Nester -- on the Culver City P.D.? He went out on a violent domestic dispute yesterday. A neighbor called it in. It got a little ugly. No arrest -- a warning. Nester said it's not the first time. Jesus, you're up early. I thought you were on late shifts. What d'you think you're doing in my house, Shar? In my home. I lost my temper. Things got out of hand. It won't... I bet you feel real proud of yourself, Shar, knocking me down in front of my family. You know what I've got in my hand? I've got a Polaroid picture of my busted-up face, and I'm thinking of sending it to your department, to your lieutenant. I'm going to turn you in to the police, Shar, and see how you like it. I didn't say anything. Drive! I'm not. Forget about him. Somebody I used to know. I don't want to know him anymore. That's all. Forget about it. Walk with me. I like it here. It's fine. What's the problem? How's it goin'? Goin' uphill, man. You try it. Mornin'. She feels bad 'cause you yelled at her. Why not smile at her?   What's it cost? You're so damn impatient. You're so busy being pissed off, and time is going by. It's not her fault. No.  I'm calling the police. Hey -- police. Maybe she'll think about it now. I'll call you later -- about the hiking. Shar... wait.    Hey! Do we go for... symmetry? Or... more off-center. Japanese. Are you into this? Bob? I don't want you around here. You asked for it -- calling me a coward. You knew I'd swing. You think I look bad now? Look at this. Nice, huh? Beautiful. The cops'll love this, right? Evidence. Don't you guys love evidence? You wanted me to swing. But you're not sorry you hit me. Why the hell not? Why not?! And I don't want you to come to Mom and Dad's celebration... Not the church. Not the party. Stay away. I don't want you around. I don't want to see you, Shar. Go get a life. I know. Hey. Hey!   Can you wait up a minute?! The city is flat. Okay? Can we stop here? Can we examine the view? Have a Milky Way? I've burned every calorie I ever had. Up?! I'm not one of those competitive guys, you know! No thanks. I can't eat and have a heart attack at the same time. As soon as you get happy, you get sad. Everything's what? Fine? This isn't fine. I know fine. This is something else. Something happened yesterday. Sure I do. All my days are the same. I'm sorry. That would make anybody sad. No.   No, you can always tell me. I feel fine.   Great. Take the day off, Pogo! Take your badge off for once. Don't be such a damn Marine about everything. Just... Someplace I've never been kissed. They tell me I was in an accident. Long time ago. I don't remember it.    I... So soon? Catch -- Jesus! Okay. All right. So... what d'you want, a coffee? I want my old job back. What d'you think? You been workin'? No, but I'm up to speed. Well, it's not good with Randal anymore. No? No, he's out of it, but Danny Coley's got something going. Wanna go see 'im? Finish your coffee. What? This time we got his ass. Got 'im? Full moon, man. Hey! This guy's crazy! This asshole side-swiped me! What?! No. I never touched his car. I better... More oil. This is pretty. Renewal of vows -- that's great. Is this your parents? Why not? So... he says you can't go? All right. Bad how? But... they invited you. Well... I know about family. It's... a door you don't close. You're closing it now. Right? Family invites you, you go. Family shows up, you welcome them in. That's family. Then you forgive. No. I just... It seems like a chance, doesn't it? A chance to make things right. I'd take it. Then you tried -- y'know? And it's up to them. Are you in danger there? I was talking to him, Pogo. Why the hell did you cause a wreck?! I told you -- I saw the kid, you idiot. I was... One more word, and your life will change forever. Are you going to tell me why we're sitting outside this building again? What's it about? Fine -- what am I supposed to do? I'll call you. Shar, I'm sorry about yesterday. It's hard to explain, but it's... I'm okay now. So... why'd we meet here? I used to practice late... outside. On my roof. I didn't know it bothered anybody until you mentioned it. You arresting me? This is wrong! It's wrong!   Why are you doing this?! I don't need your help! I don't need this. We don't need this -- we're fine... I'm not dying! I'm not pretending! I don't remember! I don't remember any of it. So leave me alone! What good does it do? It's gone! And I'm all right this way! Why do you have to change it? I'm all right. Don't talk about that!    Don't! Nothing happened! If we say it, then that's the truth, that can be the truth. Say it. Nothing happened. Say it, Shar. Say it!    I'm asking you to say it. Why not? Why are   you pushing so hard? Why does it   have to be your way? Why does it   have to be your truth? This is   who I am! This is the way I am! You like to push people, don't you? You just have to push and shove and make it right for you -- for you. You push everybody, Shar. You even pushed your family away, didn't you? You already said it.   You said it all. Rib House after shift today? I think I'll head home. Pogo?   Bring your friend. What's the name? Let's do it. Annie. Chet. I don't... want you to think I forgot about you. It's just that I... I couldn't find you. I woke up, and you were gone. Everything was gone. It all just... disappeared. In one minute. I couldn't remember that minute. I lost it. It took me so long to find it. I think I found it all now. I used a calculator. I did. I figured it out. You know... we get about 1400 minutes a day and so I figured it out. I was 33 years old and three months and eight days, so it was... I've got it here... It was minute number 17 million eight hundred ten thousand, two hundred... or so. That's the one I lost. And... when I lost that minute, I guess I tried to lose it all, all the memories -- because they hurt. I tried, but... I couldn't do it. And then we all smiled, and it was a great minute. It was. I'm really glad... I found that minute. No matter what. I won't forget... anymore.     I love you. Oh!   Oh, well, how about... You coming to the party? Big police officer now. How did you have the guts to walk into a church after breaking your word? Why even talk go me? You got what you wanted. You laugh about it? You tell your cop friends how you... You look great. Stay away from my family. Hey, everybody, keep it down. Somebody might call the police. Once the cops leave, we can really party. Why don't you give everybody a break -- and go home? What? It's fine. What the hell are you doing?! Just get the hell out... Up to you. Jesus -- you're here, aren't you? What d'you want? I feel like... I feel like I don't have a daughter anymore. Sorry, Shar.   For what I said. Was it bad? Then they don't deserve you in there. It's not a thing to say.   It's the truth. Why do you try so hard not to cry? No. No.   It's not, Shar.    It's not.
