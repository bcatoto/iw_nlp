I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive. He's drowning me! Okay. Yes please! I hope it wasn't cheap. I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you. No it's for Tom as he didn't complain. Shut up. Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine. Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom. Marge, you like everybody. You'd say if you mind? It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh. Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come. It's great. You're going to love it. Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar. Did you speak to my father? Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye. Uncanny! Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st. Everybody should have one talent. What's yours? Is that good? We? Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing. I just woke up. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine. Sure. Any time. What are you doing in Mongi? What evening? You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring. I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while. Tom, I don't love you. I love Marge. How? Marge and I are getting married. Oh God, I don't think so. Really? To Italy? So tell me. So cool. I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums? Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit? I knew it! I had a bet with Marge! I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example. No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you? Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I? Ripley's plans. That's good. To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight. I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip? I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we? You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever. She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault. What are you talking about? She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this? I don't know! Why are you asking me? How can it take an hour to find an ambulance? He's downstairs. Freddie drove me back in his car. Get undressed in your own room, would you? Shoes too? Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...? Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station. Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip. Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation. Relax. I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni. You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them. What does he say? Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway. No! Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean? Do you have any brothers? Well we certainly know that's true. It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it. I know. I write like a child. Without the glasses you're not even ugly. I don't need them because I never read. How do I look. She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true? The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating. Cold beer. Thank you Dad. That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs. I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. What were you actually doing in New York? You're breaking my ribs! You're breaking my ribs! Do you ski? Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent. Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class? See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list. Sure. I love Venice. You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well. Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back. You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged? Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money? I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up. Good afternoon! Bird! Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -- This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz. You like jazz! Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard. It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother. I'm never going back! What? Marge! You've got to hear this! I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him? Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up! What? What's this? That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression. Can you mix a martini? Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party. That's funny. Say again? Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually. Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog. This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it? Okay. And did we know each other? Who's this? Marge-maintenance. Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks. Do you think you can steer this thing? Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna. Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life. This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles. Frederico!Aye, aye. What are you doing? Sure. I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies... Dick -- you've got to hear this! Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying! Ciao bello. Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once. Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you. What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else. Have you done something to your hair? In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you. Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois. No thanks. Some kid at the American Express Office. Are you living here? Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing? He can't. He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart. Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas? The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now. I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth. Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you? It's Freddie. Let me in. Dickie?No, he should talk to you alone. I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you. Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn. Marge has been telling us about the rings. Tom. Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word? The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children. And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in? I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore. No, Marge doesn't know the half of it. He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello. Marge, good morning. Unusual weather. Far cry from New York. Tom. How are you? You look well. Good. Now you can go for a reason. Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home? I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars. I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf... Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf. Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts -- What a waste of lives and opportunities and -- You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow -- This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself. San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it? Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed. I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy. I'm sure we've met. Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.What's funny? That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels. No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh? Where's Dickie's father? I think we sort of found each other. That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said -- Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie -- We think he's had a change of heart. So we should be celebrating. No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley. Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith -- God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...! Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie. They found this in Dickie's place in Rome. A ragione. A ragione. Are you a homosexual? Interesting non-sequitur. He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside. Where have you been since then? He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder. ...Tom is a mystery... Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful... And don't forget. I have the key. What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are. What do you mean lied about who you are? Really, why? Sorry, I'm completely lost. Or Tom and Peter even. Why lie? Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance. Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith. Was that Meredith? How was it? You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back. You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person. Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future? Hello. What are you up to? What do you want to change about this moment? Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on? Tom, are you okay? Or I could come back. Do you want me to stick around? Are you okay? Not guilty. You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay? No key, huh? Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building. But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody... Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...? He's already angry, I don't think -- He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf? He says so many fianc�es. Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate. No. By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient. I don't know how to translate that. E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un... A Roma, circa tre settimane fa. You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered -- That's good, isn't it? Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome. Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day. That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous. Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece? But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses... Not at all. Morning Tom. We'll be there. I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time? And tomorrow? Will we see you later? Well hurry, before we sink. Should I give you my telephone number in Venice? Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around. Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play? The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious -- What? No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that. You love me and you're not marrying me. Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd. How? You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me. Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here -- I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam. I wanted to tell you my plan. What? I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York... Ha. Then I'll take it as a compliment. Why? Why are you asking all of a sudden? Esatto. I'm always planning. I've got plans! I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back. To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life. What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least? I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers... ...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way... I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it. You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had. I'm prepared to take the blame. What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him? I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry. Is Freddie here? I thought you'd missed the train. You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry. I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you... What club? Freddie? It's just there's so much to do in a single day. Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ? I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money. He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving. I didn't mean with you in it. Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in? No, no brothers, no sisters. Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity. Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain. Like Clark Kent. Now Superman. Now your signature. Not "Dickie". Your signature. No! I've got more than one shirt! Copy out from here... A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York. I played piano in a few places. What? And Rome. I have to go to Venice. Could we sail to Venice? I'm doing this wrong, aren't I? Your parents met her. This is so good of you. What time is it? Oh God! Do you always type your letters? That should be two Ts. I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat? I love jazz. I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I -- No, I think your mother, her illness -- I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000. Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back? I met him in New York. Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise. I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them. Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent -- The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance. Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody. Sure. I'm intruding. No, still here. You know, a primer. It's just an undercoat. Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through. Ripley. Hullo. How do you do. Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me. It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together. I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso. Freddie, do you have something to say? Hardly. You should watch that! No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob -- How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink? Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly. What about Christmas? He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you. I guess. Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it? Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley. Who is it? Hello? We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to -- You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous. Hello, sir. Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up? I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you. I think it might hurt her to know. I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie. Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo? Yes it is. I'm well, thank you. Mr Greenleaf. I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but... Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir. Thanks, yes, I think we did. There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest. Thanks so much for inviting me tonight. I hope she never knows. Okay. I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it? Is Mr Greenleaf here? Oh Marge. What? I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise -- But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day. It's all true. I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you. I told you. He gave them to me. Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me. The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize. Marge? Where are you going? Shut up! Shut up! Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical. Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this. I can explain. What? Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long. He's having an early night. And you, sir? Any better? Look at me what? That's a terrific idea. I was looking forward to seeing him. Hello Marge! No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie. Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later. We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie -- Get on. I'll take you to him. My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me. Are you getting on? Dickie did it. I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't. Marge, when did you get here? Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great! I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to -- Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest. No. Hello, I'm Tom Ripley. Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome? I think you're right. Search me. I guess we're abandoned. Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone. He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this. Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me. I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine. I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days. I was just looking at you -- so quiet. How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well? Hello Marge. I'll go and see what's the matter. What about Cortina? So I'm learning. Sure. I'm fine. My fianc�e. I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me? It's superb. That ring's so great. The green one. I absolutely agree with Marge. He's not a man, he's a god. Bird. That's jazz. Back, I suppose, slowly as I can. You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem. Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so. Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. You know what -- I am. I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later? They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me. I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer. I've thought about you. Of course. Aunt Joan. Just kidding. Are you alone? Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward. Hello Meredith. Exactly. 10.30 -- Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's. Otherwise you'd be fighting me off. You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't... C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us. Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon. Let's go. I'll take them both. I know. Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life. I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome. Is Freddie in Rome? How did you know that? What? Randall. As in the...? Emily. Just kidding. My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name. Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship. Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello. Excuse me? You're such a liar... You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things. Peter, I... I... I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody. I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me. Well that would be even better gossip. Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it? I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you. Hardly kissing. Kissing off. Was who Meredith? Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip. Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too. I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me. All kinds of things. Making plans. Nothing. Ask me what I want to change about this moment. I give up. You try. You try talking to her. It's okay. I'm fine. I'll fix some drinks. I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep. I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if... Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was... Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do. Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel. Just because he doesn't like Americans! No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me? Ask him if he's accusing me! What did he say? Tell him I have a fianc�e, Dickie has a fianc�e and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them. No. I've been backpacking. In Rome, about three weeks ago. I knew that one. It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe. No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the -- What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome? It's okay. What rumour? Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten. It's fantastic. I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty. My God. Hi. Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost... Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long? Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow. It's really good to meet you. Ten thirty? Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna? I can't later. Thanks. I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north. Ditto. Tomorrow. Absolutely. No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni. I have! It is a little coarse, yes. I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends. I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when. Thank you. Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in. No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later. 31 people. It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day. No! A few days ago. I don't remember the exact date. Was it? Did you speak to Tom? Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago. What about Ripley? Even her. I really don't want to see anybody. The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address? My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers. Can we go up? Do you mind? Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car. Postmortem? Yes, if it's going to help, certainly. I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him? I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car. Yes?I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up. Tomorrow then? Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence. I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto. You have, yes. Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San -- Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse. Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley? May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fianc�e? That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood. 31 people. No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat. Does he stay with you here? And when did you last see Signor Ripley? November 7th is my information. November, I thought. What about Thomas Ripley? Even your fianc�e...? Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fianc�e. Of course. What happened to your face? No. Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening. So, the Doctor, he has to make the -- -- come se dice? Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome. So Signor Miles drove away and you did what? It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday? Inspector Roverini. Can we come in? Dickie Greenleaf?
