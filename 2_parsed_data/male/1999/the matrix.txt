You don't know. They are dead. In either case -- It's already begun. Their next target. The name is Neo. He'll be contacting us again. Then the informant is real.Know what? We have no choice but to continue as planned. Deploy the sentinels. Immediately. We'll need a search running. Expect it. Did you get anything from the room? Does that surprise you? It was inevitable. Smith. I am Agent Smith. The great Morpheus. We meet at last. They won't make it. The sewers. Of course. No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead. The orders were for your protection. Lieutenant, you were given specific orders -- Lieutenant?What?! Should Tank I.D. it? What? No way. Not possible.All the time. It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly. Something wrong, man? You look a little whiter than usual. I know, I know. This never happened. You don't exist. Hallelujah! You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ! Two grand. I know. It's her fault. It's Choi.No! Don't hate me, Trinity. I'm just the messenger. And right now I'm going to prove it to you. That's what you think. They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream. Oh, I disagree, Trinity. I disagree. I think the Matrix is more real than this world. I mean, all I do is pull a plug here. But there, you watch a man die. Yes. You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future. But it's not here. It's in the Matrix. I'm tired, Trinity. I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day. But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit. You are a beautiful woman. Too bad things had to work out like this. He had an accident. Hello, Trinity. I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle? She would know. There's something about him, isn't there? Yeah, 'course I'm sure. Hear what? I intend to, believe me. Someone has to. You don't, do you? Do you? We're going to kill him. Do you understand that? He's going to die just like the others. You weren't supposed to relieve me. Any time. Honestly. Morpheus. He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die. Little piece of advice: you see an agent, you do what we do; run. Run your ass off. Dead. All dead. Five. Since I've been here. You bet your ass. It keeps him going. Maybe it keeps all of us going. I'm going to let you in on a little secret here. Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One. Gee-zus! What a mindfuck. You're here to save the world. You gotta be shitting me. What do you say to something like that? Why you're here? Have to. The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix. You get used to it, though. Your brain does the translating. I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead. You want a drink? The Matrix? Yeah. Midnight watch. No, it's all right. Whoa! Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me. He's going to pop! Just get me outta here. There was an accident. A fucking car accident. All of a sudden. Boom. Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me. I need an exit! Fast!I sent two units. They're bringing her down now. I'm just doing my job. You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass. Oh shit.You all look the same to me. And you are? Hurry! I know, Trinity. Don't worry. He's going to make it. Five minutes. Maybe six. He's beginning to believe. We have no choice. Give me your phone. We found him, Trinity. We finally found him. Shit! Apoc? Go. You have to focus. There is a phone. Wells and Lake. You can make it. Yes. I know. They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit. She told you exactly what you needed to hear. That's all. Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path. Trinity! Go! Get to the basement. Find the catch basin! I know. That is why it is so important for you to go. Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me. Listen to me, Neo. I know why you're afraid to go through that door. You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong. You must believe me. There is a greatness inside of you, Neo. A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world. No. I did not. I have never told anyone this, Neo. After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me. I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me. Yes I do. Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots. These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind. I believe them with my heart. In my gut. That's why we're here. What do you believe in? Why? That I would find the One. Yes. Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong. She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path. She is a true psychic. She sees beyond the relativity of time. For her there is no past, present or future. There is only what is. She would say she knows enough. Of the Resistance. Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning. Set down in there. No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to. I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air. Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world. Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be. Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure. Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable. But now I believe that is going to change. Look again. No you don't. Did you see the woman in the red dress? Do you understand, Neo? This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson. The body cannot live without the mind. Your mind makes it real. Do you know why you didn't make it? I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door. You're the one that has to step through. Tank, load the jump program. Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place? How did I beat you? Show me. Your training. Get some rest. You're going to need it. I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo. I just said that it would be the truth. Yes. A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age. I say almost funny. We have only bits and pieces of information. What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration. Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I. What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain. Wild, isn't it? You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197. I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know. More important than what is when? You've never used them before. Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them. Far from it. Be what? Be real? Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location. That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind. The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television. You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. Do you want to know what it is? Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something. What you know you can't explain but you feel it. You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about? I know exactly what you mean. Why not? Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than that. Do you believe in fate, Neo? Ironically, this is not far from the truth. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here? I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole? Please. Come. Sit. Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus. Go the the Adams Street bridge. Do you still want to meet? You're the One, Neo. You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you. They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead. This line is tapped so I must be brief. There are only two ways out of this building. One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody. You take a chance either way. I leave it to you. There's a small ledge. It's a short climb. You can make it. Good. Now there is a window. Open it. Go! Now! The cubicle across from you is empty. I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say. I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there. Yes. Yes. Now. Stand up and see for yourself. I've been looking for you, Neo. I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do. Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is? He is the One. He is the One! Do it! Tank, charge the E.M.P. We're on our way -- We need an exit. Tank. Good. I need the main wet-wall. How is he?You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming? I don't know... My computer... Right... If you get caught using that -- You got the money? You're two hours late. Who is it? Thanks... for the drink. How? What happened to them? How many were there? Really? ... Yeah. Do you always look at it encoded? Is that...? What are you doing? Sorry. I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me -- No. No! Morpheus! Don't! Morpheus, I don't know -- Did you believe in them too? Yeah? What about the other five guys? The five before me? What about them? And you still believe I'm the One? Why? So I can hear some old lady tell me, what? That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world? Come on. How do I respond to that? I can't. It's ridiculous. I mean who am I? I'm nobody, I'm just a guy. What did I do, Morpheus? Why me? What do I believe it? Are you kidding me? What do you think? I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't. The whole world, my entire life was a lie. I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus. I told you I don't believe in this stuff. No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point? Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea. What did she tell you? She helped you? And she's never wrong. How does she know? And she knows what? Everything? The beginning? So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy? What's going on? What? Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets? How? Yeah. I think I do. What -- what lesson? If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here? I thought it wasn't real. Because... I didn't think I would? I know what you're trying to do -- You -- you're too fast. This is incredible. I know kung fu. For what? No! I don't believe it! It's not possible! A.I.? You mean artificial intelligence? This isn't real? Right now, we're inside a computer program? When? Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place? Why do my eyes hurt? What are you doing? ... am I dead? This can't be... What does that mean? What truth? The Matrix? Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life. No. You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you. You could say that. It's an honor. ... Yes. What do you know? The agents -- No way, no way, this is crazy. No! It's too far away. How do you know all this? But what if...? How?! What the fuck do they want with me?! Holy fucking shit! Right now? Who's coming for me? Morpheus... Hello? What? What do you mean, without him? Morpheus. He almost had me convinced. What? I'm not the One. But what? Honestly? I don't know. Who? How did you know...? Shit, I'm sorry. What vase? Yeah. You're the Oracle? Hello? Can you fly that thing. I'm fine. Come on, we have to keep moving. It wasn't fast enough. Do what? Yeah? No, you're not. What are you doing? I believe I can bring him back. Why? I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy. Morpheus is the one that matters. I'm not the One, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too. Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not. I have to. I'm going in after him. That I would have to make a choice... There has to be something that we can do. I don't know. It just went dead. Is Morpheus alive? We can't leave him! What is it? It might have been. I'm not sure. A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it. Nothing. Just had a little deja vu. ... right as rain. What did she tell you? Did you go to her? Should I be? Is it? But an Oracle can. What does that mean? I used to eat there... Really good noodles. God... E.M.P. An electromagnetic pulse. Get this thing out of me! Uh-oh... What is this thing? ... shit. Why? From what? What the hell is this?! What is the Matrix? Who is? Of what? How did you do that? Do you want to go somewhere and talk? I just thought... you were a guy. Gee-zus. Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base? Who are you? How do you know that name? It's locked. Which way? Which way? Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here! Guns. Lots of guns. Because I believe in something. I know that's what it looks like, but it's not. I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed. I understand that now. That's why I have to go. The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me... Does it? I don't know. This can't be just coincidence. It can't be! Can it? Goddamnit! I don't believe this is happening! What do they want? How much time? How? What are they doing to him? See who? Hell yes! Holy shit! Where is it? It's a city? Zion? You don't have... No.Oh, God. That's the third white van I've seen. Weird. He's gonna make it.Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store. I got you. Cypher? Operator. How...?! I'm going to make the call. Yes, sir. Got one ready, sir. Subway. State and Balbo. Goddamn! It's good to hear your voice, sir! Now left and that's it in front of you. Got it. Ten hours straight. He's a machine. Kick it in! Kick it in! Duck! Operator. Okay. Store's open. What do you need? Besides a miracle... Why? Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building. Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them! I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide. What are you talking about? Neo, this has to be done! Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix. They are used only in emergencies. If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system. It would be the end of everything. When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know. Depends on the mind. But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this. They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems. It's like cracking a computer. All it takes is time. They're hacking his mind. The Oracle. Hey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready for more? Deep underground. Near the earth's core, where it's still warm. You live long enough, you might even see it. The last human city. The only place we got left. If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be. Any holes? Nope. Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human. Born free. Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion. You will tonight. I guarantee it. I'm Tank. I'll be your operator. Morning. Did you sleep? They've burned through the outer shields. I don't know. I lost him. I can't! What the hell just happened? Operator. Trinity, we don't have any other choice. There is. We have to pull the plug. I'll be all right. So did we. I sent him to Franklin and Erie. You're not far from Cypher. Yes. They're moving him. I don't know where yet. Operator.
