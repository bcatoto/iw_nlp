Oh yeah, he's good. Okay. John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan! Who am I thinking of? The one where you're that jewel thief. Malkovich! John Makel... Say, aren't you that actor guy?Tell your friends. Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes. Please, have a seat. I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer? I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that. You'll have me, after all I've done to you? I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess. And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before? You came up here looking for the portal? I'm sorry for everything. Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was. The iguana? He's a lucky man. Do I know him? I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful. I love you so much. I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster." Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole. That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart. Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage. Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine. I'm a puppeteer. Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop. It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding. Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously. Tell her you need to see her. Shut up! Yeah, well welcome to the nineties. I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated. No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry. Life is confusing, isn't it? Don't forget me. We? And he was with her. You were him last night, weren't you? We wish. What about Maxine? What's that? You've always loved the animals. No they're not. What? You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked. I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak? After dinner I'll show you my puppets. I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that. You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems. So how was it? What was he doing? Why? How was it? This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right. What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking. Why aren't you at work? Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop? Tomorrow. We're late for Lester. You weren't you. You were John Malkovich. We'll talk about it in the car. Okay. Maybe tomorrow. I'll meet you on the turnpike. Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house. Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now. What? Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich. All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little. I'll be in soon. A little while. Yeah. You want a beer? Right. The ferret? I'm sorry. How was your evening? Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away. Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We�re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is. Hi. Just an idea I had. Yeah, just an idea I had. Hmmm. Hmmm. We have to make it an early night. Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here? I... puppeteer. I'm a puppeteer. May 11th. Yeah. Okay. Which one is Elijah again? What? The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job. We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate. Enjoy. Morning. With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood. Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you... I know. I'm sorry... So how was it? You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience. Sure, after a fashion. Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually. Holy shit! He said what I said! Holy shit, yes! I can't believe it. This is too good to be true. Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I�m in love with somebody else. I am a trained performer. I said "yes." Yes? Forget it. My name is Schwartz. Schwartz. Schwartz. No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester. You're insane. Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about. Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually. In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other. No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and... No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately. Dr. Lester... Thank you, sir. Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and.... Dr. Lester. . . That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run. Yessir. Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now. Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion. The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history. I'll keep that in mind, sir. I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you? Just one. Why is this floor so short? No. I understand perfectly. No. You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester. Glooph is not a letter, sir. Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer. Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke. No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary. Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester. But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny. What happens when a man climbs through his own portal? Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house. Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. You're glowing again. You're evil, Maxine. I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like. Are you torturing me on purpose? This is amazing! We're gonna be rich! My God. Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in. Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence! You wanted to be partners with me? But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it. Tickets to Malkovich? Yes, of course. He's a celebrity. Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away. He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century. There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike. This is important! Don't you want to know what happened to me? It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine. Please, let me explain. Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see... Hi. Well, I'm a puppeteer... No, wait! I like your tits. I love your tits. I want to fuck you. I mean, I am really attracted to you. I�m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male. That's the usual? No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or... I like you. I don't know what it is exactly. I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something. What'll you have? Yeah. But enough about me. Buy you a drink, Maxine? Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine. Maxine. Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine! That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops! I'm right? Great. Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine? How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight. I just wanted to say �hi.� Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work? No, really. You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something. Emily Dickinson. Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp. Is that true? Moving story.That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White. Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office. So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha! It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building. Hello. Wendy.Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo. If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and... Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love? It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you. You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice! Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you! Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no! When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly? Hello, I'm here about the ad. Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes! Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire! Can I be anyone I want? Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard! Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak! You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis. You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said. Yex? Mr. Juarez? Money, Miss Warts? I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now. Pardon? Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez... Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs? Think, Jew florist? Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two. Fork ah did? Gehginnis ondah foam?Says me. Do you dream often? It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them. Do you dream often?The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy. All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha. You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend. Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick. You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe? Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned? I'm sure you're not going crazy.I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly. There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly. You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. Ma'am The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain �doors� which should never be opened. And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking. I see. Are you unhappy at our little company? More beet-spinach juice, my friend? Ah. yes, the little door. There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it. Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see. Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water. Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us? You can come too if you like, Schwartz. Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig. Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. �Ladies,� I begin. �I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven... All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you. I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz. No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me. One hundred and five. Carrot juice. Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz. Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears. Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. But seriously, that's all covered in orientation. Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions? Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz. Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying." Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order. You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph? Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp? She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you�re implying. Security. Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know. Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek. Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire. I was just asking. No disrespect intended. Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry? I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan. Do tell. I love a good plan. Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational. The Great Mantini? What kind of circumstances? How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no? I like that. A scary dream? Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him. The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions. We saw his show at the Luxor last night. Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir. And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich. Good morning, Lotte! Thank you, Floris. Yes, my dear? Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine. Forget it. Floris, get Guinness on the phone. Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle. But of course. Anybody else? Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil. I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel. I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route. Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal. I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs. Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours. No! Don't harm the vessel! Aaaahhhh, the portal! Oh, sorry. Right this way. Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video? What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself! Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing. You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear. My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to. You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him... ...for lack of a better word. No you mustn't, my child. With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know. Oh, be still my heart. Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno. I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz... I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now... This is my fiancee Maxine. Yeah, okay. I don't know. I never played a jewel thief. Thank you. Malkovich. Yeah. It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court! This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God. I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see. That... was... no... simulation. Let me try! Let me try. Simulates? Holy shit! He said what I said! Holy shit, yes! Maxine... Do you? Says who? Do you? I gotta know the truth, Kevin. I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something? I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out. I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte. Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth. Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've... It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy. Who needs dancing? Is there dancing? I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night." Sounds boring. Are there any songs? Never heard of it. What's the play? How do we do that? She's not available. Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now. Did you see the reviews? Good-bye, Maxine. Derek Mantini! Honey, we can be happy and poor together. I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it. I've got to leave Malkovich. Sleepy suddenly. They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!" The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!" Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!" Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio. He's a selfish bastard. I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today. Vegas. Can you arrange that? Shut up! Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute. Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini! No! Please! Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here. It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it. No! But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product? You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls. Really? Yeah. Okay. You mean with Malkovich? Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists. No... damn... you... Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit. I'm getting better all the time. Oh, so the bitch escaped. Yes. How did you know it was me? Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court. Come on in. What the fuck is going on? No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go. Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here. Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me! Yes, Maxine, yes. No, I guess not. I'm an actor. I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"? Oh sure. It's very rewarding... Oh, I'm really glad you called. Can I get you a drink? How'd you get this number? Who's calling? Yeah?No. Great then. Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy. Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society. Say... "Equus"? It's got everything. A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk. We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see. Yeah, I saw them Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.Aye. Speak then if ye must. I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon. What want ye, girl child?
