Yeah, I�m like that. Senility says the wife. But she sure can�t complain. Heh. The erector set still works good. And this ain�t no fucking rug! G�head. Feel it! All mine! Mnunn. Cold lately. That night, couple weeks ago. That was real cold. Remember that? Nope. No maps. Ocean, huh? On vacation? What of? Only two bucks. Shave as well... Looks like you need a haircut to me.Well, sir... I don't know exactly. They don't speak English... No one available. His wife. All the same entry wounds. It's definitely him. She lives... lived here. A prostitute. Says he is the man's doctor... You know... Maybe ten minutes... That�s strange.It must be a closet or something. Yes. Such a joker! Like your father. Which one? Look! This is a good one!Shut up, freak! Monster! You are insignificant. I see. The verdict, yes... A book of delusions. Anything else? A fanciful idea, Mister White.Please... Don�t kill me! I see. Then who is after you? What sins have you committed? Then we must call the police. You seem restless.I'm afraid so. You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector. Have patience - you'll see for yourself. In there. Please, they'll kill me... You are mistaken. I don't know what you're talking about. Loose ends? Yes, of course. Everything's fine... He's seriously disturbed... Just visiting my patient. He tried to kill me! We are... living in their dreams... I'm... being... punished. Nothing. I don't know anything! No it isn't. You are doing it! Now raise it over the glass and... Don't ask stupid questions. Look at it. Please! Don't be foolish! Time is short. Let me show you something. Look at this syringe. Everyone get's one - very much like this... But this one's special. It will help you understand, everything... If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer. No, it's the truth. You can't go yet. We've got so much to talk about... What are you doing? I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though. Trust me completely. I'm here to help. Maybe. Anything but , my friend. We are little more than a sum of memories. From them we reference who we are, where we're going. Without a past we are nothing. This is why you are so interesting. You remember nothing, eh? Let me show you something. Not exactly. She was found in a canal, disembowelled. Throat cut. Blood drained. The body wrapped in a bed-sheet. I cannot say... You don't know the answer to that? Well... That's right. I am your doctor. If you like. Tell me about them... Bad dreams? Your name is John White. What does she say? The woman. Water? Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? Is there nothing you remember? Not even a detail? You must try. You remember nothing? Who you are? What you've done?Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me. This case is very important to me. Just a little warning: I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that. How could you have been so stupid? Yes. That's right. He's ill - he needs expert help. What makes you think that! If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked - you might get things done faster, Bumstead... I�ll be the judge of that. Anything else? Why do you want to speak to him? Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing. Anyway he isn�t with us any longer. The case is yours. Go through his files. Take what you need. By the way, how�s your mother? I see. One thing�s for sure, he�s ambitious. You�ll be a busy man from now on. Why are you wearing that thing on your face? Yes. This way.A few days... a few weeks - dunno, I can't remember. Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again... Now, please leave me alone. No... No doctor... Is that your idea of a joke? I don't remember... Take my advice, Bumstead. Get off this case. Now. They've taken my mind, my memories... Not that. Anything else. Can't let you in... sorry.Not really... The city. I need to get to the ocean. Sell maps? Thanks. Just some pills. I need something to keep me awake. What now? Where do you think this goes? Well. The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean. The point is no one seems to know how to get there. What? Don't know that either. I don't know who they are. People... after me. I woke up in a subway. I don't know how I got there. I - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something... I'm scared. Where are we going? Where does it lead? You see it? No. Have a look. There. Behind the cabinet. Where does it go? What is that door? I didn't realise... Wait, this isn't fair... But I... Everyone has a job - a function. Each one teaches you more about your invention. I'm what is called a murderer . Shut up! Just let me sit here for a moment? I�ll go soon, and stop bothering you. No. I mean... that isn�t necessary. Someone�s after me. No. I, ah... What is it? What happened to you? What are you hiding? It's a trick. Why? You've been working too hard. Not that again... So you're telling me the truth this time? Is that it! You're a liar! I have to go... I'm sorry. About before. Can I get my life back? I'm nothing then. Horrible... Did she drown? The woman you told me about? I told you, I can't remember a thing! Known me for long? You're supposed to be my doctor, right? Yes. That's what people keep telling me. Asks my name. Over and over. Just like a broken record. Only thing is, I can't answer. I've no idea what my name is . Waves... A beach. A woman whispering. That's all. I need to stay awake. Do you have any pills? You think I haven't been trying! It's like there was never anything there. Just water. You know something about me? How do I get there? Tell me. I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them? How do you know I'm innocent? I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
