Monday, September first.  Six-fifteen. The alchemist awakes.  "Turn lead into gold, Max,  lead into gold." Today, I find it. Heat's been getting  to Euclid. Feel it most in  the afternoon when I run the  set. Have to keep the fans on  all night from now on.  Otherwise, everything is  running topnotch. The stack  of 286's is now faster than  Columbia's computer science  department. I spent a couple  hundred dollars. Columbia's  cost? Half a million?  Ha... Oh, no. One hundred fifty-eight thousand,  a hundred two. Right? Three point three one eight one  eight one eight... Somewhere in there.  Somewhere. I know it's right  in front of me. The pattern.  They say it's chaos, it can't  be understood, too much  complexity. History it's there.  Lurking, shaping.  structuring, hiding, right  beneath the surface. The cycling of disease epidemics,  the wax and wane of Caribou populations  in the Arctic, sunspot cycles,  the rise and fall of the  Nile and yes! the New York Stock  Exchange, they are all the  same. I'll find this structure,  this order, this perfection. Turn lead into gold.  The first. Right here. Right  here. With math. The numbers  of the stock market are my  lead. When I find the  pattern, then I will find  gold. Hello? Yeah? Who's this? I told you... Sorry, I can't. I can't. I don't take offers for  my research. You know that.  Sorry, I Couldn't help you. Hi, Devi. Great. What are you doing? It's fine. It's fine. I have to go. Thanks. Sixteen, twenty-seven. Results: Euclid  shows tomorrow's Dow closing  up by four points. Anomalies  include PRONET at sixty-fire  and a quarter, a career high.  Possible explanations, either  A, an error in the June fifth  algorithm, or B, Euclid's  main processor is running a  recursion... Oh sorry, am I bothering you? I'll put it out.  The name's Lenny Meyer And you are? Max. Max? Max Cohen. Cohen!  Jewish? It's okay. No, I'm not interested  in religion. Have you ever  heard of Kabbalah? No. Jewish mysticism. I'm sorry, I'm very busy. I understand...it's just that  it's a very exciting time in  our history. Right now is a  critical moment in time. Really? Yes, it's very exciting.  Have you ever put on Tefillin? Tefillin. You know Tefillin.  I know it looks strange.  But it's an amazing  tradition that has a  tremendous amount of power.  It's a mitzvah for all  Jewish men to do. Mitzvahs,  good deeds, are spiritual  food for our hearts and our  heads. They purify us and bring us  closer to God. You want to try it? I gotta go... Are you okay? Max? Max? I'm sorry, bye. Well, maybe some other time. Please God, Let it be a  small one. Sixteen thirty-five.  Second headache in under  twenty-four hours. They're  getting more frequent  now...more painful, too. Drugs  don't work, just take the  edge off of it. Just gotta  wait for the nosebleed.  Relief comes from my nose. Ahh... Leave me alone. No! No! Who is... My house...how do... Damn. I didn't get to it. I'm so close, Sol. I'm  so close but I just can't  grab it. We'll see. You found things... Tuesday, September  second, eighteen twelve. If  Sol hadn't gotten sick who  knows where math would be. He  spent years in the numbers of  Pi. Searching for meaning, for  order. Three point one  four...off into infinity  and maybe insanity. Somewhere  in there he wanted sanity.  Sanity like he found in the  circles Pi represented.  Simple, sane circles. If only  the stock market had circles.  Some type of sanity. Some  type of form, of shape. Hey, Max, how you doing? Oh, okay. Lenny Meyer.  I'll put it out.  So, what do you do? Um, I work with computers  ...math. Really? What type of math? Number theory. Mostly  research. Number theory? No  way, I work in theory, too.  Not traditional, though... I work with the Torah.  Amazing. Yeah... Yeah. You know Hebrew is  all numbers. It's all math. Hm. Here, look...the ancient  Jews used Hebrew as their  numerical system. Each  letter is a number. You see...The Hebrew "A," the  number 1. The Hebrew "B,"  Bet, is two. You can take any  Hebrew text and turn them into  a long string of numbers. The Torah is just  a long string of numbers.  Some say that it's a long  code sent to us from God. Kind of interesting. Yeah, like take the  Hebrew word for, say, the  Garden of Eden, Kadem. Kuf,  Dalei Mem...Kuf is a  hundred. Daled, four Mem,  forty. They equal one hundred  and forty-four. Then take the  tree of knowledge...in  the garden, Aat Ha Haim, it  equals two hundred and  thirty-three. Now you can take  that number and... They're Fibonacci numbers. Huh? The Fibonacci sequence.  Italian mathematician, thirteenth century. If you divide  a hundred and forty-four into  two hundred and thirty-three,  it approaches theta. Theta? The Greek symbol for the  golden ratio. The golden  spiral. You're right, I never saw  that before. That's the series  you find in nature. Like the  face of a sunflower. Wherever there's spirals. You see, there's math everywhere. Math everywhere... Everywhere... Oh my God... Simple shapes!  Tuesday, September second.  Twenty-twenty-two. Sol! Sol!  Sol! Shapes in the market.  Why not? And they're spirals!  Spirals! A circle spread out overtime.  It's open-ended. It has a  beginning and it grows and  changes through time. If I  can find where it fits, if I  can spin it and lock it into  a group of numbers, then I  can calculate the future.  Lead into gold. Chaos into  order Madness into sanity. Pain  into bliss. Perfection. What the... Shit! What the... Wednesday, September third,  seven-fifteen. Results: AAR  at fourteen and a half�low,  very low. ABR at six and a  half�jeez. Six and a half, ABR  hasn't been beneath twenty in  ten years. Conclusion:  Simple. There is no pattern.  No pattern. Chaos, chaos, all  chaos. Euclid crashed. I lost  all my data, my hardware. Burnt... I don't know, first I got  these horrible picks. Then  Euclid spits out some  numbers. Never saw anything  like it and then it fries.  The whole machine just  crashed. Of? I threw it out. I don't know, just a long  string of digits. I don't know. I don't know. Probably  around two hundred.  Why? Yeah. That a breakthrough will  come... Hey, excuse me, can I see  that? Six and a half. My God. My God.  Yes! Yes! Hey, paper, please! Who are you? I'm sorry, I don't... No, no, no, really, I  can't. On the nose. On the damn nose. Um, no, it's Max from next door. Do you have any iodine? No. I just need it to stain a  slide. Just something with my  computer. I just threw out something.  I didn't realize I needed it. Just a printout. I, uh,  lost my data... Max! How you doing? Lenny  Meyer. Oh, hey... Hey, where you going? You  got a few moments to do Tefillin? I gotta car, we can cruise  over to my... You gotta car? Yeah, right there. That's  Ephraim, my friend. All tight, lets go. Great... Lenny, I don't really  want to do... Do it for me? It  means a lot, having someone  of your stature performing a  mitzvah in my presence.  When you told me your name was Max Cohen, I didn't realize you  were the Max Cohen. Maximilian Cohen. You know me? 0f course, I've  followed your research since  your Columbia days. It's  revolutionary. You've inspired  the work we do. I have? Yes, very much  so. The only difference is,  we're not looking at stocks.  We're searching for a pattern  in Torah. What kind of pattern? We're not really  sure. Our calculations have  shown us that there is a  number encoded in the text. What sort of number? We don't know.  All we know is that it's two hundred and sixteen digits long. Don't worry. This one just  goes over your head. Two sixteen? Yes. Now we have to say a  small prayer, repeat  after me. That's it. Wasn't  so bad, was it? You feel  anything? What is it? It's a prayer about our  dedication to our one and  only God. No, I mean the number, the  two sixteen number? What is  it? Oh. We don't know. We just  know that it's the most  common number encoded in  the text. It might be some  type of linguistic pattern.  If we could figure out what  the number is we could maybe  answer that. Tell me more. What's going on, Sol!? What's the two hundred  and sixteen number, Sol? You asked me if I had  seen a two hundred and  sixteen digit number, right? What do you mean by "found it"? Well, there's these  religious Jews who have... Well, you know,  Hassidim. I met one in the  coffee shop. The guy's a  number theorist. The Torah is  their data set. The thing is,  they're searching for a two  hundred and sixteen digit  number in the Torah. They say they don't  know, but that's crazy. I  mean what are the odds... But hold on, there's  something else. You remember  those strange picks I got. Right. Well, it turns out  that they were correct. I hit  two picks on the nose. Smack  on the nose. Something's going on, and  it has to do with that  number. The answer is there. No. it's a pattern. A  pattern is in that number But as a Go game  progresses, the possibilities  become smaller and smaller.  The board does take on order.  Soon, all moves are  predictable. So, maybe, even though we're not  sophisticated enough to be aware  of it, there is an underlying  order...a pattern, beneath every  Go game. Maybe that pattern is  like the pattern in the market,  in the Torah. The two sixteen  number. Or maybe it's genius. I  have to get that number. Damn it already! Stop  following me. I'm not  interested in your money. I'm  searching for a way to  understand our world. I'm  searching for perfection. I  don't deal with mediocre  materialistic people like  you! Go. I'm not interested. I told you I don't want money. Ming Mecca. They're not declassified. What do...do... Yeah, I got to go. Let me think about it... Hey! Up, buddy Coney Island, last stop. Your nose. Jenna. I can't now, Jenna. I'm working now, later okay? Hello, this is Lenny? Lenny, it's Max Cohen. Max! How are you?  You want to come down? I've been thinking about  our conversation earlier. That's good... I want to help. Excellent. Do you have the Torah in  digital form? Thursday, September  fourth, sixteen forty-five.  The alchemist awakes. All of  my ideas, work and dreams are  spinning together It all has  to do with spirals. It began  with spirals and the answers  are thee. The most I can  remember about their  significance is from  Schneider's class. That  bullshit core for majors.  Schneider's fascination with  mystical geometry made him a  bit of a quack...but...then again,  look at Kepler. He was really into  Pythagoras. The leader of an  ancient sect which believed  the entire universe could be  represented by numbers.  Pythagoras' greatest contribution  was the golden ratio, which ended up  influencing art and science  for thousands of years,  arguably all the way up to  today. The golden ratio,  if I recall, is this unique  relationship between the length  and width of a special  rectangle called the golden  rectangle. If you take the  width of this rectangle and  use it to form a square within  the rectangle, the part left  over is a rectangle that has  the same ratio as the  original rectangle. au can  continue squaring the  rectangle, over and over  again, making the  rectangles smaller and smaller  to infinity. Then, if you  connect a curve through these  rectangles you get the golden  spiral. The Pythagoreans  loved this shape because  they found it everywhere  in nature. It really is amazing. In the sea,  on land, in air, our basic building  block DNA and even our home. If we're built from  spirals, while living within  a giant spiral, is it  possible that all of human  behavior, if it could be  quantified, is in the form of  a spiral. Then, maybe, extensions of our behavior  like the stock market. maybe  even the writing of The  Torah, is infused with the  spiral pattern. Friday, September  fifth. Seven twelve. It's  fair to say, I'm stepping out onto a  limb. But I'm on the edge and  that's where it happens. Three, eight, two. Marcy Dawson. Who's calling? Max Cohen. Hold on. Look what do you want for the chip? No, I don't. I don't know if I'll find  anything useful. Okay. First, I want you  to call off the surveillance. Yeah, I'm a very private  person. Knock on my door and  leave the suitcase outside.  I don't want to talk to Anyone. I'll knock back. The Torah. What is it? In Hebrew characters and numbers. No, what is it? The two  hundred and sixteen digits. I don't know.  If you get it, maybe  we can figure it out.  Can you really find it? If the number's in there,  I'll find it. Wha... No, no.. No, no, I just. It's that  she's your girl... No, no, sir, please. I've  never touched Devi...I  never will. Okay. Friday, September  fifth? Lots of work to be  done. But I'm close, so  close. Today is the day Might  have cost me my soul, but  down the line I'll work it  out. Just keep them in the  dark, let them beg. A damn  Ming Mecca chip. It's like  giving a desperate junkie a  syringe filled with junk.  Defense uses them to nun  nuclear sub reactors. Me? I'm  going to dissect the market. Happy birthday, Euclid. Eighteen thirty. Press return... Max darts over and smacks  the RETURN. Moments later we  see what Max sees Oh God. Damn religious  freaks.  The holy Torah... Ah God... Too much...too soon. Ohh... Stop, please, stop. What the? What is it!? What is it!? Two...two hundred. That's it! That's it! Oh... What happened? The number, the number. Four...zero... seven...It's in my head,  it's in my head. Somehow I  memorized it. I got it up  here! But what is it? 0ut, out, you have to get  out. Get out, get out it's my  room! Out! 0utt Out! Get out! Saturday? Dark outside. There  was a moment there...when, I don't  know...when I didn't exist. What? What? Must be an explanation, must be a  reason. Must. Bastard. Two and a quarter, twelve  and an eighth, six and two  eighths. I know these...Seven  and a quarter. Two and a half  ...oh...oh... My God. It's gonna  crash, it's gonna fucking  crash. You lied to me. You found the two sixteen  number in Pi, didn't you? You  saw it. I saw it, Sol. I don't  know what happened, but I  know things. The market is  going to crash. It's going to  crash. It hasn't yet, but I  know it will. I saw it, Sol.  What is it, Sol? What's the  number? It's in my head! The computer becomes conscious? Studying the pattern made Euclid  conscious of itself. Before it died it  spit out the number That consciousness  is the number. Stop? How can I stop? I'm  this close. What are you saying? You were afraid of  it. That's why you quit. C'mon, Sol. That's bullshit. It's  math, numbers, ideas.  Mathematicians are suppose to  be out on the edge. You  taught me that! That's where discoveries  happen. We have to go out  there alone, all alone, no  one can accompany us. We have  to search the edge. We have  to risk it all. But you ran  from it. You're a coward. You can't tell me what it  is. You don't know You've  retreated to your goldfish,  to your books, to your Go,  but you're not satisfied. I want to understand it.  I want to know! Who are you working for? Here, here. I don't want your wallet. Who sent you? Who the hell sent you!? Wha...I'm sorry... Who are you?! I'm...a...student I've got  an assignment for class. Leave me alone, damn it.  Leave me alone. Marcy? What's up? I can't, I got work... Don't ever hit... Leave me alone. I don't  know anything. Hey! Hey! Hey! I didn't do anything. I  didn't play the market. How could you do that? You selfish, irresponsible  cretins. How could you be so  stupid!? C'mon! I know who you are.  You're not gonna save the world. My God, what are you doing? You can't kill me! You bastards! You stupid  bastards! Farrouhk! Max! C'mon... Farrouhk what about Farrouhk!? Stay down! Go back! He's okay, he got  in his cab. We've been looking for you. What's going on? Do you have the number? What's going on? Do you have the number? Yeah, I have it! You have it. Where is it?  You have it written down? What is it? What are you doing!? What  the hell are you doing!? We're not joking  around, Max? Where's the number? It's not on me. It's in my head. You memorized it?  Did you give it to them? Who? Who!? Those  Wall Street bastards. Why do you care? Just answer me! Screw you! Hit him! You're dealing with something  really big now, Max. I don't  want to hurt you, so answer  me. Did you give it to them? They've got part of it  Now get off me! Damn it! Damn it!  They're using it. Using what? Shut up! Let go! No, don't! Max, Max. You're  okay I'm Rabbi Cohen. Cohen  like you. I'm sorry for what  Lenny did, he's been  reprimanded. It is not our way  Are you okay? Yeah, yeah Everything will be  fine, Max. You need to give  us the number. Do you have  it? What is it? I told you we don't know You wouldn't be so  flipped out if you didn't  know. What's happening to me? Give us the number! Screw you! Okay, okay! Lenny,  easy! Max, I'll tell you  what's going on. Just calm  down.  The Talmud tells us it began two  thousand years ago, when the  Romans destroyed the second  temple. What are you... Just give me a chance.  You'll understand everything  if you listen. The Romans also  murdered all of our priest- hood�the Cohanim�the Cohens,  and with their deaths they  destroyed our greatest  secret. In the center of the  great temple was the holy of  holies which was the heart of  Jewish life. This was the  earthly residence for our  God. The one God. It  contained the ark of the  Tabernacle which stored the  original Ten Commandments  that God gave to Moses. Only  one man could enter this  space once a year on the  holiest day of the year, Yom  Kippur On the Day of  Atonement, all of Israel  would descend upon Jerusalem  to witness the High Cohen's  trip into the holy of holies.  If the holy man was pure he  would reemerge a few moments  later and Israel was secured  a prosperous year. It meant  that we were one yea r closer  to the messianic age. Closer  to the return of the Garden  of Eden. But if he was  impure, he would die  instantly and it meant that  we were doomed. The High  Cohen had a single ritual to perform in the holy of holies.  He had to intone a single  word. So? That word was the true name of God. Yeah... The true name, which only  the Cohanim knew, was two  hundred and sixteen letters  long. You're telling me that the number in  my head is the name of God!? Yes...it's The key into  the messianic age. As the  Romans burned the temple, the  Talmud says, the High Cohen  walked into the flames. He  took his secret to the top of  the burning building. The  heavens opened up and took  the key from the priest's  outstretched hand. We've been  searching for the key ever  since. And you may have found  it. Now let us find out. That's what happened. I  saw God. No, no, Max.  You're not pure. You can't  see God unless you're pure. It's more than God... it s everything. It's math  and science and nature... the universe. I saw the  Universe's DNA You saw nothing. I saw everything. There's much more.  We can unlock the door with  the key. It will show God  that we are pure again. He  will return us to The Garden. Garden? You're not pure.  I'm the one who has the  number Who do you think  you are? You are a vessel  from our God. You are  carrying a delivery that  needs to be made to us. It was given to me. It's  part of me. It's changing me. It's killing you.  Because you are impure. It will kill you! And what will it do to  you? We're pure. Give  us the number! The number is nothing.  You know that! We can use it. We  can wield it. It's just a number. I'm  sure you've written down  every two hundred sixteen number.  You've translated all of  them. You've intoned them  all. Haven't you? But what's  it gotten you? It's not the  number! It's the meaning.  It's the syntax. It's what's  between the numbers. If you  could understand you would.  But it's not for you! I've  got it. I understand it. I'm  going to see it!  Rabbi...I was chosen. Suddenly, it's all there.  It all makes sense. I  can crack it. I can know it.  I know what it is. Sol knows,  too. I need to tell him. I  need to show him. I need to  bring him with me. Sol? What do you mean? Where is he? No. Stop it, please! No. No. I'm ready. I'm  ready! Show me! Three, seven, two... Where am I? What is  this? This is wrong, Sol.  Sol! Sol! You were right Sol!  He was right. He was right. I want to  breathe. Breathe. I don't know. I really don't  know. What is it, Jenna? Oh.
