Yes? Go on... I know... I know... Nice to see you find Political Science so stimulating -- Julie! Wait! You okay? You sure? You don't seem fine. The shower again? I'm sorry. It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better. It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself. To get out of Southport? Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school... Are you okay? Are you sure? Um...Okay. Bye. I got in early. I was excited... Who was that guy? Yeah. Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first. Hey, I'm sorry. You're right. Are you ready to go? I've got the old truck. You know the drill...Crab boil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen Pageant...It's only small-town fun, but it's still nice. People really miss you. I miss you. Can't what? I understand something. I have to work, Julie. My boat's in Southport, remember? But, I get it. You need your space from Craokerland. And maybe from me, too. You know where to find me. It's okay. I'm just gonna go. You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone. Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you. I'll talk real slow. You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules. That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance? Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me. This was not my idea. I said, this...Do you want a drink? Where I come from, you want to snatch the goodies, you got to at least talk to them first. How about a drink? You okay? Hey Julie? Hye, baby. You following me up here? Well, all right. This is Mark in the Morning for Magic 96.7 Radio Station! Who am I speaking with? Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend? How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway? Good, then I hope you remember your geography, Karla, because all you have to do to win is tell me the capital of Brazil. C'mon, Karla, one easy question, one great getaway! Karla, we need an answer. No looking it up. Okay, Karla, five seconds. Five...Four... Three...Two... Oh, no...Did you say Rio? You just won Magic 96.7's Quickie Getaway...a trip for four to Tower Bay Island in the fabulous Bahamas. We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station? Hey, Ray...phone! Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry. No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just... Julie, I love you. I know I'm only a humble fish, but if you really look at it, you're a fish, too. Oh, Ray, you're right...Do me like a snapper. Hey, something smells like fish... What? The Bahamas? You're kidding. This weekend? You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me? Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it. Okay, I'll try. But, listen... If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time. Man, what is your problem? We haven't caught anything for days. Pull the big ugly stick out of your butt. She asked you to go to the Bahamas! Man, you gotta go. We'll both drive up. I got friends I can see up there. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. What were you thinkng? You wanna see what I've been thinking? Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb. I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming. No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched. Man, I love AM radio. You got right-wing conspiracy, tips for pregnant womem, Single-A baseball games, and real country music... None of that new crap... "...Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys, don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks. Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such." I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone -- No. The guy looks dead. Maybe not. Hey! Buddy, what's up? Hey, can you hear me? DAVE! ...Dave? Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or we gonna get tropical? Julie, is everything cool? Karla said... Is there a problem here? What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute... Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second. Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all. Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes. Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining. You just gotta breathe. Can't talk right now. See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it. Some folks just can't sail. That's too bad, too, because it's the only way on or off the island. Unless you have an accident. And then they call the Coast Guard. Yep. That's what the tourists pay for -- sun, sea, and solitude. Are we there yet? Few more minutes. I feel like I'm still on that thing. That way for a complimentary Planter's Punch to get you readjusted. I can get used to this. Welcome, Fair Princess, to Tower Bay. I'm Derrick. At your service for the duration of your stay. I'm at your service, Princess. Season's over old man. So I gotta work fast. If Marine Radio's right about the weather, you're already out of time. Yes, ma'am. Anybudorsomethin'? My brother, can I interest you in the islands finest ganja? Hey, Tyrell, we found you brother. Not possible. Who be wantin' the kind, the uber- sticky, the Bwana, The depth-charge, the Up-All-Night-Laughing-With-Your- Friends? Who wants it? 'Cause Titus got it. No, thanks. Come on, man. Everybody wants something. How 'bout you, ladies? Lovely ladies. Something I can do for you? That's cold, but if that's how you want it. Anybudorsomethin' you come and see me. I'll scare somebody up. Whoa! What can I do for you? Ah, yes. Roll out the red carpet. Our contest winners are here at last. Nice dog. Not really. I've found peices of guys like you in his stool. What's your problem, buddy? I don't have a problem in the world. Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock -- Okay, we get it...It's old. It'll outlive you, I'm sure. Wilson comma Karla... Oh -- You're in 201 and 202. Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites. Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet? And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need. July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork. It's our version of winter. 201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy. We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves. And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend. Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical! 201 and 202...Who put you in...? Don't use these much -- No real reason. Pretty fancy rooms for kids your age. Oh, yeah? What you have to do? Guess the capital of Brazil -- Ahh, good for you, girl. ...And, where would you like me to put the bags? Promised me what, baby? I made all my promises to William. Sweetie, you brought your nightie, didn't you? Forward! A girl needs time to make up his mind. Julie, look, if it's cool, I'll sleep on the couch and they can have their own room to practice for that real honeymoon. I'll take those. No, I've been doing this since before you were a dream in your father's eye. You sure it's okay with you? You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand. He's beaten up pretty bad -- Yes, but he seemed certain his friend was killed out on the highway by somebody named Ben Willis. He said he has a hook on his hand. He said he was driving a BMW. There's no body. And there was no other vehical involved. He fell asleep at the wheel...and ran his old truck into a guardrail. He got thrown way the hell down into a ditch. He's damn lucky. He suffered a severe head trauma -- Probably once he rests up, it'll all come back to him. Tell me this ain't the bar scene. We didn't get all dressed up for nothing. Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai? The guy at the desk said the place would be quiet, not dead. The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard. So why are you still here? What's the matter, boy trouble? He leave you? Pretty cool bar. Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather! Go baby! Go! Come on, it'll be fun. Ju-lie! Ju-lie! Ju-lie! Julie? What's wrong? What do you mean, Julie? It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think... I scared you -- I crossed the line -- Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand. I'm going to take a walk and dry off. I just really like you and I want you to feel good about everything...You know? I want you to be happy. Dork. Why? Ah, baby, let's stay right here. I like the sound of this. Damn. I should've brought my pole. Get lost, you scared me. Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out. Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain. That's why you'll come with Titus, mon. There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out. Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones. I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere. Up-tighteous and self-righteous. Hello, little sea bass. You're lucky I'm busy or I'd hook you myself. Hello? Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care. Too late for that. We're miles from anywhere, baby. No one's gonna hear you scream. I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle. No water sports after midnight. Hotel policy. What's the policy on burnin' herb? We got one for that, too. It's don't try until you buy. You don't buy any, you don't get any. There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us. How's the water? Crowded. Ahh, that feels great. Alone. In the room. Got any advise? Yeah. Find another Jacuzzi. I need an international operator. What? What are you talking about? Where? I don't find this at all funny. Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming. I knew you people were goining to be trouble. I knew from the first time I laid eyes on you. Who? Who is here? Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet. The rest of us see bathrobes. Fine. Show me the body. In the morning we'll talk to Derrick, the "dockhand guy," and put the whole thing to rest. Now, let's slow down on the Dark and Stormies and get some sleep. Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days. There's a storm coming? 'Tis the season, like I told you. It's a big one. Phones went down a few minutes ago. Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it. Sorry. Emergencies only. I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts. All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter. Jeez, that's a full carat -- How much? Well, there's some flaws in her... How much? Don't really have the market for something like this... I can go two...two-fifty. Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too. Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period. I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring. Fine, buddy. Is it loaded? Load it. This ain't the romantic weekend I had in mind. Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode. See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason? Leave her alone. I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time. You don't have to be a jerk. Where is everybody? They're all dead...Dead, I tell you. Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss. Shut up. Hello? There's nobody here, Tyrell. They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners. Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something. You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression -- Hey -- shut up, okay? I don't like to fish. You coming? Hey, Bong Marley. Come here. I'm gonna kill you, Bong Boy. Come on. Jump. I've got you. Thanks. I gotta find me a pool boy. Take this. And do what with it? Julienne of pool boy. Hey, pool boy. What the -- ? That's chlorine and muriatic acid. Put the two together and you get cyanide. Cyanide? Like poison gas? You mean, somebody really killed him...Omigod. Think...Think... Get back -- Hang on... Yo, Brooks, listen up -- Whoa -- Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho. Julie! They were cut loose. Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here? Who? We're on an island, miles from anywhere. I don't give a crap about you're fisherman. There's dead bodies pilling up everywhere and there's one guy missing -- The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos -- Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first. People live healthy in Miami. It's the future down there every day of the week...The future. I'll keep that in mind. Yo, Freak Boy -- He's not here. We're gonna find some weird crap in here. I told you. Missing a hair tie? We found our guy. We gotta find flashlights, torches, guns if they got 'em, anything that'll help. Wait. Maybe he's down there collecting the body parts. Let's go. We'll only be a second, okay? Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place. Here's youre killer -- No -- We found your voodoo crap -- No -- I found the bodies this morning...I tried to use the radio, but he already destroyed it. I haven't hurt anyone...I stole those things to help you. To protect you. You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer? You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this -- I know who you're talking about. He used to work here at the hotel. And I've seen him around again. Out in the woods by the orchard. I can't remeber his name, but I don't forget a face. I can show you... How do we know you're not setting us up? Where else you gonna go, son? Show us. What the... I need to get to Tower Bay Island. We're closed. I need to get there, now. Did you happen to notice what's going on outside? I'm not looking for a weather report, I'm looking for a boat. So which one's yours? He worked here for many years. He had a nice family. A pretty wife and two little ones. A boy and a girl. They'd be about your age, now. One day his wife went missing. Maid found blood all over the honeymoon suite -- Room 201. Eventually, they found her body. Pieces. A leg in the swamp. An arm washed up on Three Mile Beach. And the head they found much later. Careful -- People say she was running around on him. People say he caught her in bed with other men. People say a lot of things. He disappeared, taking the two small ones with him. At least they were never found. We're here. Where'd Estes go? What is up with that weirdo? I'll go find him. He's probably the only one who can help us. I'll come with you. It's okay. He couldn't have gone far. I'll catch up with you later. I'm not hiding up no tree. I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt. What I need is a gun. Not a steak knife. You gonna clean vegetables? You gonna stir-fry? You need something that'll get his attention. Forget that. You didn't do nothing. This fisherman's a piece of scum. I should've been listening to you... I'm sorry. Now, let's take a look at the pantry. I don't know, but I'm starving. Hey Estes. Estes? Where'd you go? You abandoning us? How come you didn't tell us you had a boat? This has to end. Now. What -- ? Steel door...Food...Perfect. It's just a -- Don't kill me -- And so could you -- crazy fool. Must have missed the sign. Don't even get her started...It's a long, long story and you probably wouldn't believe a word of it. I mean, all I know for sure is this is the worst vacation of my life... I'm tired, and I'm hungry, and I personally haven't seen one damn psycho killer... Come in...This is Summer Breeze requesting emergency assistance for Tower Bay island. I repeat...This is Summer Breeze... You'd be amazed by what you'd see. My wife with every man on the island, for example. And you, sexy...I loved watching you. It's you guys, thank god. Is everyone okay? Come on. We're gonna be okay. Estes came after me with a gaffing hook. I guess so. When I was coming back I saw your slicker friend looking for you guys down by the water. Let's hurry and get inside... You'll be okay. It's over. That's because it's not my blood. It's time you woke up, Julie. Will...He's in on it. He's -- Look at the bright side, Jules. We finally get to spend some quality time together. Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend. We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right. What'd you have to do that for? Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son. Hi, Dad. That's my boy. Shush, now. No more screaming...No more running. Time to die. Let go of her! Now! You gotta be kiddin' me. What're you gonna do, boy? Call us names? Let her go. Now. Think about it, boy. You're no killer. That's my job. Stop right there. You don't have it in you. We haven't missed you down here, Ray boy. I got to know Julie real well. Think of all the things I'm gonna do to her. Dad, finish him. Gonna blind you first. You can't kill me. I'll always be with you. Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. Did I scare you? Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay. We got the refrigerator in. Come see. It's gonna be great. Checking the locks again?
