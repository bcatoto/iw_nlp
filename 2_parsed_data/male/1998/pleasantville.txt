It's better, Mary Sue. With what? Why not? We were gonna ... You know ... It's six-thirty ... Mary Sue--C'mon ... It is? I think ... I might be ill ... To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while. Sure is pretty. Lover's Lane! But where would we go? What? Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ... I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you? So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important. Hunh? Oh, right ... ... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about. Oh yeah. I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ... I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue. What's all the commotion? Where's the cat? Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke. I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ... She won't go out with me? Yeah ... How'd you know? What's the matter? What?No it couldn't! That's not going to happen! Okay, that's IT!!!What happened? Real rain? Are you alright? What is it? Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs. And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce. And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it. No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ... I really don't know. Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market. Wife wants him to get one of those new beds. "Changes." And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things. Did you hear about Bill Miller? I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town. You know what I mean by "changes"? I'm fine--but thank you. Oh, no thanks ... No it isn't. It's not in ME. THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE. BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS! YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER! You're not allowed to lie. Okay--that's enough! The basketball team? Very well ... Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges. Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children? Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness? We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary. Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall: Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta. You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this. BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS? Do you know that it's illegal? Did you do this? You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station. What do you mean!? Dan! Arrest them!"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see." What is it? What's outside of Pleasantville? And where's that? How'd you know how to put it out and all? How'd you know about the fire?Oh. guess I could do that, then. Well, I never had to do it before. Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.Thanks ... I love you. ... It's a pretty short trip. I won't. Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ... Sure. Wait. No ... They won't be able to tell. Looks just like it did. Have you got any make up? It's okay. It's alright. I'm fine. Oh no ... I'm fine. No, I ... I was just ... worried about her. It can't be possible. We're in Pleasantville? What'll it be? I didn't say that. It's just that right now ... What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ... Lucky guess. Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ... You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ... I don't believe it. Oh God! Are we in that episode? But it could happen. C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ... Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her? Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too. You might even call it "love." Oh sure it is. But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you. Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either. Why am I out of order? I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you. I thought I was allowed to defend myself. See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ... And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them. Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ... Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win. It's like the basketball team. I think I've got something to say. It was accessible to everyone. Well--it was dark out ... Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer? Still doesn't make it right. Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want. Yes I do. Yes I did. I thought the books were blank? Look it doesn't matter. It's not important. Um ... Outside of Pleasantville. What? The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare. No, not that hedge. The other one. What color is that hedge of yours? Mr. Simpson ... Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell. Hello Mr. Simpson. And you're sure about this? You got the admissions letter. Honestly ... no. This thing works. We could go home right now. Are you sure? Oh, I don't know. Maybe ... ... it's not just the sex ... What? Yes. Wow. You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me? Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up. Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me? Well ... I just ... Can I ask you a question? That's great. ... Yeah. You're reading? Nothing. The pages filled in? Sure. It's fine. It's okay. Really? It seems so fattening. They don't have that kind of potential. I just don't think we have the right to ... They're happy like this. You have no right to do this. You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE. You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you. What did you do to him? Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes. If you need anything, I'll be right over there. Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work. Jen please ... They don't notice that kind of thing. He won't notice anyway. It's in your closet. I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home. Jen, listen ... JENNIFER! What were you doing in a library? What? One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack. I don't think so. Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean. As a matter of fact he does. Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team. To who? We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back. Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue. We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ... Owns the hardware store. We're supposed to be in school. Just take deep breaths. I don't believe this. I don't know ... It's not possible ... Is it possible? Oh God. You--you gotta get us out of here. I don't know. I'm not sure. Oh my God. Get lost! Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this. No way. No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote. Oh my God ... Oh my God ... Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs. Yeah. Every episode ever. Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty. What are you doing? I like it too. No I won't. I swear. I'm not sure. Sure ... It was a prop for the school play ... We'll just put up the top. Yeah ... You don't have rain either? Rain. They just grow like that? Hunh? Well it's big. And it's blue ... ... It's really really blue. Yeah. Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ... What? Yeah ... I guess. I don't know. Mmmmgh. Oh ... Right. ... Lover's Lane? Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ... Hi. Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ... No. You baked them for Whitey. Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey. Oh. Thanks, Margaret. Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon. Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon. Marmalade. Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter? Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have? There's worse places. I'm going on trial tomorrow? I don't know ... Three, four weeks. They weren't my memories. I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them. I'm sorry. I can't do that. So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ... Why don't you just take me back without it? Why? I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors. I'm going to leave now. I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that. No you're not. Why? I didn't do anything wrong. ... Only if they mean it. Look ... I had nothing to do with that. Look--it just sort of "happened" ... What do you mean? Oh--well ... Terrific. I'll talk to you then. Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow? Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ... Re-runs? Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ... Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ... I can't. ... Hi. COME BACK!!! WAIT A MINUTE!! Where are you going ... Don't get upset. Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now. My name's David. Because we don't belong! What the hell's going on! How much does it cost? Ooomph? No. McIntire's. Remember: "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's." McIntire's. Yeah ... ... Like Prince Charming. ... Her father. You know, we didn't call any TV repair. Yeah ... Sort of ... It's beautiful. You're gonna keep painting aren't you? It's okay. We'll get you a new one. Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ... What's wrong? Open it. It's an art book. I brought you something ... From the library. Hi. Yeah. I think you should try not to think about this anymore. Wow ... That's pretty good ... ... What's that? So they can have their hamburgers! Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway. Forget about that! Just listen to me ... What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point! Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ... Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes. Yeah ... Yeah ... Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early. Oh hi! Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along. Have you cooked the burgers? Do you have the lettuce? Listen to me! What? I understand. You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet. Yeah ... What's wrong? Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous. Sleep well. This is TV pal. They don't fool around. Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ... Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down. Much less than that. An hour and a half. How long do you think you've been here? I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ... Just gimme the damn remote! Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you? It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came. Because you're coming home. Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control? Hope you're proud of yourself. You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!! OW! JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE! EXCUSE ME? Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was. Where's the remote control I gave you? Oh no? Let me show you something! OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF! It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is? Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again? A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ... You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ... What do I MEAN! You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ... NOW! I want a word with you ... BUD. Excuse me? Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey. ... Those aren't your cookies Bud. I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ... Bud--I thought you wanted to come home. What? So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again. Well c'mere, young fella. Hello there. Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ... I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed. Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know. I don't think I better talk about this right now. But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you. Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud. Why would I do that? Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ... You know ... ... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ... Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free. Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show. Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it. That's right. McGinty's. What department store did they go to? Nice ... Nice ... Right. And how did she dress him? Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh? I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend. We'll get you fixed up in no time. Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella. You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation. Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore. Dream come true, hunh? A miracle. Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something. Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do. Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him? Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles? Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years. What's the rush? Well here I am. Yeah. TV busted? TV repair.Where are you gonna go? Okay--now you listen to me ... You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table. It goes away ... It'll go away. It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ... Sure you are. Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ... I was in a bowling-alley. All night? But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about. Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys. ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here. That's IF she can learn to bake. Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought. Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home." Rain. Oh sure ... You bet. Betty ... Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say. No. Of course not. Thank you very much. ... How? Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do? One of those ... big beds? No. What? "Changes." Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ... Want some bridge mix?A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night? You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on? Scout? Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?Cool. So uh ... Maybe we could uh ... Yeah. Saw you at the mall yesterday. Hey.Yeah. Or like sprinklers in the summer ... Yeah. It does. But you can't go out there. You can't go out there. I don't know. It's alright. Let me see. It's alright. Wait ... No she's not. What? Isn't it great how she's resting like that? Here's my favorite. Bud brought it to me. Well ... Here's what it's s'posed to look like. Having kind of a tough time. Thanks. No, no ... Come on in. Oh, hi ... Oh, hello Betty. Just a little--You know. Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was? I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ... No, that's not it. I'll never be able to do that. Oh my Gosh, Bud ... Aren't you a little early? Oh, hi. Oh. Okay. I'll try that then. Really? Well don't you? Thanks. But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?" Christmastime. You know what I really like? Why? Oh ... Okay. ... But I really liked it. ... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ... No I know ... I know I do ... But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ... Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore. Oh--what's the point, Bud? There aren't any cheeseburgers. Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself. You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors. Bud ... Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay. Yes. ... Yeah. Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ... There aren't any cheeseburgers. I'm so glad you're here. But you didn't come so I kept on wiping. Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ... Oh. Bud?The other one? Green. Yes. Hear your Dad got a new car. Hello Bud.
