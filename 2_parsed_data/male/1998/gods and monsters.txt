Damn straight. I'm sick of playing games. So you don't want to fuck. That's what you're telling me? I like my life. I'm a free man. I'm not a kid. You mean us? If you enjoy it, you should do it. You liked it too. I didn't mean to... Hey, no strings, right? That's what you always said. Just good pals who have the hots for each other. He's an artist. Anyway, he's too old to think about sex. It's different. He's a man. And by the way you have no business calling him a homo. This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here. Someone who's done things with his life. I wasn't going to try anything. What's that mean? If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like my famous person. Yeah, my own personal famous person. Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to. I've gotten to know someone who's famous. You know what? I think you guys are all jealous. So what did you think? Maybe it's supposed to be funny. Go wash glasses if you don't like it. We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that! We are watching my fucking movie. Fuck you. Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself. What makes you say that? Why is everybody giving me crap tonight? Thanks, doll. But how're you going to explain this? How did you get him out of the pool? We have his note. But I didn't do this! He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't. He did it himself. I didn't do it. This wasn't me. I put him to bed. He's not there? Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood. Thanks. Why do you do it? Maybe. But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go? I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale. It's not what you think. I'm not going to hurt anyone. No! Well...no, not really -- You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo. A homo? Sins of the flesh? Everybody has those. You're sure of that? Then you're as single as I am. Yeah? What's your husband do? You ever been married, Hanna? You proposing what I think you're proposing? Don't you think I'm a little young for you? Oh, I don't know. Because no girl in her right mind will have me? I'm not married. You mean family? All in Joplin, Missouri. I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go? Movie stars? How long you worked for Mr. Whale? That's okay, Hanna. I'm more comfortable in here. It is Hanna, isn't it? Tea is fine. Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then. Something I can do for you? You do that. Gimme a break. I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures. Is that going to hurt him? Yeah, I'm a good man. Something make you think I'm not? What're you talking about? It's your job, lady, not mine. I'm here so he can draw my picture. Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because -- You'll feel better tomorrow. All right. Need some help? Did I hurt you? You okay? Look, if you want to die do it yourself! You're crazy. I haven't done a damn thing with you! I'm not that way. Get it through your fucking head. I don't want to mess with you. Just take off the fucking mask! It's too tight. All right. Let's take it off now. It's from the first World War, isn't it? I don't know. Why? What did you expect? Bronze? What won't do? What'd you say? You survived it. It can't hurt you now. It's no good to dig it up. Your friend? You're planning a trip? But that was so long ago. It can't still bother you. I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here." I was wondering which here you meant. James Whale. This afternoon at the party. That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here." Storm's getting worse. Do you mind? Them's the breaks, right? No war stories for this pup. You know what he did when I called him? He laughed. He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel. Said it was a good lesson for me. Not to try to fill his shoes. I didn't have the guts for it. I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing. Hey, I loved it too. A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself. The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist. He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance. They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted. Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family. That's not the way he saw it. To him, it was like his life never got started. Nothing else really mattered. Definitely not his family. By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out. My old man was a Marine. He enlisted the day he turned seventeen. -- that I was a Marine. Which is true. You filled in the rest. I never made it to Korea. Never gave it much thought. Why not? Give us something to do while we wait. I thought you'd given up on my picture. Is that --? Do I have any other choice? You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms? No. Definitely not. Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling? Good. Let's get dry. Just a night out. Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter. I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia. You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon. Can't you see? It's raining! Oh fuck. And we left the top down. You want to run for it? Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again. Actually, no. I feel a little out of place. Is that really her? No. The girl. Who's that? What was that about? I don't hear anything. If that's okay? Do I look okay? Clayton is fine. I'm game. Sure. You don't want me to sit for you anymore? No harm done. I don't get it. First you creep me out with homo shit. Then you hit me with war stories. And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want? You asked me to model. Remember? You're the one who started it. I didn't -- Something happened to him? This was World War I? You were a soldier? You're talking through your hat now. You must think the whole world is queer. Well it's not. War sure isn't. There's no people like you in my crowd. Not fear. More like disgust. I told you. I don't like to talk about that. Not me. I don't know. I guess I like your stories. I'd like to sit for you again. But only if you ease up on the locker room talk. Okay? You first. From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it. Understand? Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy? Do you have to rub my nose in it? Cut it out! How long were you...? You've done a helluva lot more than most people. Do you miss it? What happened? Is that why you and your friend split up? Because you wanted to be free? Thoreau with a lawnmower. The world is just one kiss-ass game after another. A man has to make up his own life, alone. You know how it is. You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it. Not at the moment. I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel. I'm fine. I'd just rather keep it on. I just feel more comfortable keeping it on. You just said you didn't want me self-conscious. Sorry. Not today. Can I see what you did so far? No. I -- What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say. You know. Look at me like -- like I look at women. You don't think of me that way, do you? I'm not, you know. No, I -- you're a homosexual. So you had a wife? You ever been married, Mr. Whale? Sorry. I don't feel like sitting still today. Can't today. Full up. I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega. No. I could have, though. Proud? Any jerk with a gun can kill someone. I don't like to talk about that. Why? Was it supposed to be funny? No. I liked it. We all did. Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends. This David's a friend? Go ahead. All right, I guess. I don't mind. I'm not crazy about my old man either. I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks. We weren't rich. But we weren't poor either. What? Your family ate dripping? Sounds like something you feed the dog. No. I'm fine. Take a picture, it lasts longer. All right already. I'll take it off. Kind of warm in here anyway. But it's just my face you want to draw. I'm not wearing an undershirt. It's new. "Bride of Frankenstein." Did you see this? They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night. All right then. Sure. I could use the extra dough. You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right? And it's just my head you want? Nothing else? But why? You mean -- you really want to draw me? Just a year. I dropped out to join the Marines. Football in college. Broke is more like it. What's to sketch? You mean, like posed for pictures? Huh? What was wrong? What did she mean by going flooey? Still. You must be rich. Making a couple of famous movies like those. "Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest? Really? Yeah? What were some of your movies? Sure, everybody does. When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week. Why? Were you an actor or something? They're just copies then. Gotcha. I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar. Excuse me, but -- are you famous? These are your paintings? No. Iced tea's fine. I stink to high heaven right now. Just got away from me. Sorry to disturb you. Yeah. I better get on with my work. Just that I was in the Marines. Boone. Clayton Boone. Nice place. Mornin'. Have a drink? I think I'll hang around. This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times. I liked it. You learn stuff listening to old-timers. I'm up. Thanks. Fuck off! Where's Betty? I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open. The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that? I just want to watch it, okay? Good. Fine. If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie. See if his name's on it. How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?All right, then. I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast. Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own? I didn't ask George to invite you. Well the rest of us aren't. Can't you remember that? You know what I mean. Your reputation. You only embarrass yourself. You didn't, Jimmy. Should you be drinking in your condition? I was, until last night. Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception. What are you doing here? Goodbye, Hanna. By the way, I like the Renoir. You remember how a production eats up one's life. I'm sorry, Jimmy. But with this movie and two difficult stars -- Then take the pills. She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on. In a manner of speaking. I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related. That's as good a way as any to describe it. I've seen far worse cases. You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane. The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations. Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random. That's what I'm trying to explain. You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.Hey, Boone. You coming, Boone? Ooooh. You ever hear of this Whale fellow? Hasta la vista, Boone. And give the jail bait a squeeze for me. You told me to get you up, asshole. Boone! You awake? Eight o'clock.My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin. Dogs are so much more dependable than men. I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line. Oh no, my dear. You look absolutely amazing. There's no way I can compete with you. The scene is yours. My God. Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair? I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.She took the night off. Heavy date. Some guy she's had her eye on for a while. Go home, Clay. We're closing up. Sick stuff. Necrophilia. I wonder if they knew how sick they were. You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay. Calm down, Clay. Just calm down. We'll watch it. I told you. I don't turn on the TV except for the fights. Can't say that I have. Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.Don't go away. Don't think that, Mr. Whale. I love your movies. That's why I wanted you to come to this. So I could see you with your monsters. I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary. I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list. Bet you thought you'd never see me again. I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party. Right. I was going to take a swim. Oh my God. What's wrong, Mr. Whale? Is it your heart? Mr. Whale? Are you all right? He's one of the great images of the twentieth century. As important as the Mona Lisa. Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look? Okay. "Frankenstein." Tell me everything. Just like going swimming, isn't it? I can't believe I'm doing this. Can that count as one question? Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"? Can we talk about the horror movies now? I guess. George Cukor? Who made "A Star Is Born"? I never guessed. Too warm for a sweater, anyway. That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal. Then the rumors are true? You're serious. That's funny, Mr. Whale. I don't mind. No. I never said you were. Or will be soon. But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for. Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all -- How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"? Your father was a schoolmaster? Everything. Start at the beginning. Nice. And your lighting and camera angles. You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it. Sure. That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours. "Bride of Frankenstein." I know. People's movies aren't their lives. And this is your house. Wow. The house of Frankenstein. I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa. Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors. I can't believe I'm meeting you.Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow... When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle -- I can undress myself, thank you. Pray you, undo this button. Nothing I didn't deserve. Oh Clayton. No, I don't want to die alone. But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable. They say you never see the one with your name on it. But I want to see death coming at me. I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face. Your face. Think, Clayton. You'd be my second Monster. Almost as famous as the first. It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share. Break my neck. Or strangle me. It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me. Please, Clayton. We've come this far. Oh, but you have. You undressed for me. I kissed you. I even touched your prick. How will you be able to live with yourself? Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms. Won't they be surprised? Oh, but you feel good, Clayton. Relax, Clayton. I can't hear you. I can't hear a word. What was that? There are straps in back. Please, Clayton. Just for a minute. Long enough for me to see the effect. For the artistic effect. The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. It's quite striking. Don't move. You are much too human. No. It won't do. So it is going to happen after all. Oh no, my friend. It's digging itself up. There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it. All my diversions have abandoned me. Parties. Reading. Painting. Work. Love. All gone to me now. Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory? Barnett. Barnett on the wire. Oh, but it does. Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make. I don't recall. Memories of the war, perhaps. I don't remember that one. "A perfect night for mystery and horror. The air itself is filled with monsters." Not at all. That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one. A very good story indeed. I'm very sorry. What happened? Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake? A very lucky thing indeed. The Great War? I see. But you said -- Come now. I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea. A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy? Someone for whom death would be a blessing. Tell me something, Clayton. Do you believe in mercy killing? I'd like to try again. If you're game. After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches? The only memento I ever kept. My original sketch for the Monster. Very sporting of you, Clayton. Sorry. My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel? No more immodest than a kilt, you know. That only leaves the rest. You're much wider than I am. You won't want to attempt to get into my pants. I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry. I believe I promised you some clothes. Oh, of course. Clayton. You finished your shower already? Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man? It's not like her. Catch my death. We're not sugar. We won't melt. Let's get out of this funk hole Run for what? Monsters? The only monsters... ...are here. Neither of us really belongs here. Are you enjoying yourself? David produced her last picture. Girl? Oh. Elizabeth Taylor. David. The friend I thought was in New York. Nothing of importance. Just two old men slapping each other with lilies. Shall we have a drink? Exactly. Cukor was too cheap to hire music. There's nothing but chin-wag. The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag. What did I tell you? Listen. Nothing would please me more. I suppose you'd like the top down. Good afternoon, Clayton. Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone? If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest. There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused. It was foolishness to attempt this portrait. You cannot force what will not flow. My apologies. I had no business snapping at you. I want -- I want... Just go. Please. Why don't you go? Of course I remember. Do you think I'm so senile -- You're very clever, Mr. Boone. You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking. What a crazy old poof. Why are you here? What do you want from me? Why do I tell you this? I never told David. I never even remembered it until you got me going. You will not set me on another walk down memory lane. Not this lane. Not today. Barnett. Was that his name? Leonard Barnett. He came to the front straight from Harrow. And he looked up to me. Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters. How strange, to be admired so blindly. I suppose he loved me. But chastely, like a schoolboy. No, my dear. The Crimean War. What do you think? The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had -- I was an officer. Not at all. I was in the foxholes myself. Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers. No teammates in football? No comrades in Korea? Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us. Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion? And the fear you showed at our last session? How did you overcome that? What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes. Everybody has stories to tell. I'm curious, Mr. Boone. What convinced you to come back? Mr. Boone. You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday. Oh no. I never swim. The extras are in their places. Now we need the star. Wouldn't you like to get in the pool? I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no -- Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful. No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks. And pricks. Hard, arrogant pricks -- Twenty years. Too long. We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show. But I chose freedom. David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue. I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend." The dirty little secret of a nervous producer. Better work. I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world. Yes. I wish I had done more work. It's so far in the past now. Over fifteen years -- After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away. Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business? The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor. Anything to avoid losing the German market. They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb. For which I was blamed. You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession. The horror movies were behind me. I'd done "Show Boat." Major success. Great box office. Now I was to do something important. "The Road Back." An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany. It was to be my masterpiece. In a way, yes. I suppose so. I know it's why I stopped making pictures. I like that. But take care, Mr. Boone. Freedom is a drug, much like any other. Too much can be a very bad thing. Ah. A philosopher. Very well put. Why not? Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone. You have a steady companion? Of course. I don't want to scare you off. Not before I'm finished with you. Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons. Is that so much to ask? Just two little buttons. Oh dear. I have made you nervous. But we have to match the other sketch. It will only make you self-conscious. You'll have to remove your shirt. I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today? So we understand each other? Don't be ridiculous. I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type. What way might that be? I never thought you were. Oh dear. If one must have a clinical name. Does that surprise you? Or a husband. Depending on which of us you asked. My friend David. He lived here for many years. No. At least not in the legal sense. Just a trim. And mine while you're at it. Fingers are a bit stiff today. All righty. I understand. I'll pay our going rate. Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges. What is we say phooey to the hedges? Could you spare an hour after lunch? To sit for me? Yes, I believe you could. How free is your schedule this afternoon? Quite true. Hand-to-hand combat is the true test. Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand? It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of. Did you kill anyone? Of course. I had to make it interesting for myself, you see. A comedy about death. The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke. But the Monster never receives any of my gibes. He is noble. Noble and misunderstood. Pity. People are so earnest nowadays. Did anyone laugh? Did you now? Yes. An old, useless friend. You must excuse me, Mr. Boone. This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment. Lunch should be ready. Shall we? Is this David's doing? Do you mind? I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor. How are you, Mr. Boone? So glad you are free for lunch. You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia. In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine. Every Englishman knows his place. And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you. My family had no doubts about who they were. But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature. I had imagination, cleverness, joy. Where did I get that? Certainly not from them. No, you were middle class, like all Americans. There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth. Yes, my family ate dripping. Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley. Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone? I've spent most of my life outrunning my past. Now it's flooding all over me. I'm sorry. I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is. Of course not. As I said, only poor people -- It is. Only the poorest families ever ate it. We kept ours in a crockery jar. Dripping? Do you ever eat dripping in this country? The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars. Used like butter on bread. It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it? You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you. Would you be more comfortable barefoot? Feel free to remove your boots and socks. That's exactly what I intend to do. We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders. Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness? Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable... Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear. Pish posh, Mr. Boone. I'm not your Aunt Tilly. I'm sorry. It's too white, too distracting. Would it be asking too much for you to take it off? That shirt, Mr. Boone. Hmmm. I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man." Shall we begin? You don't say? Which picture? Excellent. We'll have a most interesting time. I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone. I can assure you of that. What are you suggesting? You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder. Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him. Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head. I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me. Of course I can understand your refusal. It's a great deal to ask of someone. Yes. You were a Marine. You went to university? But expressively broken. How did it happen? You have the most architectural skull. And your nose. Very expressive. Sat for an artist. Been sketched. To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled? You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone. But you have a marvelous head. Nothing serious. A touch of stroke. I returned recently from a stay in hospital. When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you. Please, Mr. Boone. Help yourself. Merely comfortable. Here's Hanna with our refreshments. Can you get the door? I made only the first two. The others were done by hacks. This and that. The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures. In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood. No, I was merely a director here. But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were. Tell me, do you like motion pictures? They were familiar when I painted them. That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago. And that's a Rembrandt. You know what they say. If you have to ask -- What? Oh yes. Splendid. Or would you prefer a beer? The honest sweat of one's brow. I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two. I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea. I'd like it very much if you'd join me. Everything alright, Mr. Boone? Getting to be a warm day. A scorcher, as you Yanks call it. The Marines. Good for you. You must have served in Korea. I couldn't help but notice your tattoo. That phrase? Death Before Dishonor. What does it mean? And your name is --? My name is Whale. This is my house. Good morning. Yes. Perfectly. Then who did? No. I never could. You must regret having had the invitation sent. But I have no reputation. I'm as free as the air. Oh dear. I'll never work in this town again? I did. But Princess Margaret was a doll. We're all equals in her eyes. As commoners, I presume. You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton. Oh, David, stop being a nanny. Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York. Thank you. Oh, David. There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty. You better go, my boy. You'll be late for that aeroplane. "The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars." I wanted to be alert for your visit today. Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital. It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe. If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once -- You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better. That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life. So what do I do? But the rest of it? The killing headaches. The phantom smells. My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity? You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head? Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What's my story there? Good-bye. So nice to see you... Oh dear. Of course. Perfectly all right. But if you'd like to sit -- But you appear quite fresh, my dear. Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old. Elsa? Nonsense, my dear. You look extraordinary. Today's script. Quick. And a pencil. Bring a mirror. Let the Bride feast upon her visage. I'll be out this afternoon, remember? Your family can visit as long as they like. It needs a hat. There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora... Of course. How is the old boy these days? Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna? I'd hardly call our yardman a friend. Who was that at the door? Does the yardman come today? I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you. She is beautiful. No, Hanna. My heart isn't that black. Don't be silly, Hanna. He's a very proper actor. And the dullest fellow imaginable. Go. Just go. We can manage without you. Yes, yes, yes. I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard. My mind's lovely. And yours? No. Let me lie here. Thank you. Oh shut up. All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him. You must think I'm terrible, Hanna. Luminal. Yes? Don't be daft. It's just a student from the university. There is iced tea, Hanna? Cucumber sandwiches? Hanna? Who's the new yardman? My monsters? I commend you. If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you. You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs. You, Mr. Kay? How do you know George Cukor? You didn't? Mr....Kay? I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home. Head. Not heart. I just need to -- lie down. Studio. Daybed in studio. You think so? That's very kind -- My idea. Muchly. My sketches. Big heavy brow. Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef. Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly. I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one. Righto. Let me see. Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through. I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste. Of course. Certainly, Mr. Kay. Is there anything in particular you want to know? Don't be shy. There's time to stop before you go too far. Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story. You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago. Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers. Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica? A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks. What rumors might those be? Quite. It is, isn't it? My life as a game of strip poker. Shall we play? Let's make it more interesting. I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing. I have a proposal, Mr. Kay. This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think? I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay. Twenty-one. The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking. The horror pictures were trifles. Grand guignol for the masses. Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures? There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End". Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job. "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it. It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned. Of course. I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught. I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it. The Great War, you know. You had a Good War, but we had a great one. Yes? I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow. Grandfather was a bishop. Church of...Church of Eng... So, Mr. Kay? What do you want to know? This is the studio where I paint. After you then. Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay? Is it now? Hanna? I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool. One likes to live simply. No. I expect you can't. Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. James Whale. Sit? Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal Highness?
