And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive. He tells me you're very beautiful. Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel. We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete. It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated. Wait here. Mobile HQ. In a blue funk. Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ... Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect. Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died. Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father. Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...' You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ... Steed We want Mrs. Peel. So you say ... Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer? A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...You're not venturing alone, surely. Very good, Mrs. Peel ... Privately owned by ... 'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation... Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ... The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative -- I was getting to it. Makes two of us. Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling. Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance? Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ... Half-brother to be precise. Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch: Valentine Peel. Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel? Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ... About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ... The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment. This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going? Quite frankly ... it could have been you. A cover ... for us. I'm sorry... Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority. Government approved. The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ... We want to help...! You need treatment, Mrs. Peel. You can't resign. London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world. Would it be possible to use it for military purposes? Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire. The Ministry's worried. Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes. Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out. My number two. Special assignments. She's -- Looks like rain, Steed... Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it. Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ... I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel. Where? You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I. Mother and Father know best. Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately -- Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ... This man -- did you see him? Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb. You. Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry. She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk. If she is, there's only one solution. Termination. Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open. She may try to kill you. Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out. Possibly. Split personality ... She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill. Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise. Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody. I expect you'll like her. Weather's turning nasty. Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.This way ... Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry. You with Mother or Father? I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you? Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy. Are you alright, young man?No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922. Then you can't come in. You are female? I'm afraid that's impossible. May I help you, madam ...Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly! There, look! Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised. You mean you don't recall?? You Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ... You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man. Let it be rain, please let it be -- No, please! I beg you ... Mrs. Peel -- ?No need. I'll call again. There are limits? You don't say. How real does it feel? Seriously? Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June? Shame. I was recommended. By a friend. Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ... Our chaperon. Not quite. It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel. As a matter of fact I have ... English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ... A fine night, Mrs. Peel ... 'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -' The plot. Hello, we must be going ... Mrs. Peel? Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder. No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well. Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ... I'll be back ... Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers? They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel. Snuff. I must insist you try some. You first. Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's. Intoxicating. Here, have one of these. What's that you're wearing? There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend. You didn't tell her? We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ... I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you. You'll find out. His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones. Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful. Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies? Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ... Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who? I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling: he's disappeared ... I told Mother I took care of you. You don't trust me? After you -- Mrs. Peel ... Winning isn't everything. I thought you didn't. Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel? Not for a moment. Keeping a stiff upper lip? I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ... ... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust. Always. Except ... No trouble. Nothing personal. Orders. I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ... The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ... Mrs. Peel ... ? I expect we'll have to gatecrash. Here's the one that broke the camel's back. You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you? What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing? Do you always drive this fast? Oh, well ... Just my type, Mrs. Peel. According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior. Q.E.D. ... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you. No sisters? No undiscovered twin? ... And by you, Mrs. Peel ... Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research. But if someone miniaturized the process... Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ? Is there anything that isn't? Don't bother. Here's a bus ... For you, Mrs. Peel. Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ... Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ... What on earth? Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ... Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry. Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion? I must say, you look more your old self -- An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...? Did he say who? Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel. Frankly that's how I remember it. Why should they think that? I might say the same. I wasn't about to. Strange. Ah, Brenda ... Mrs. Peel? Small talk. Try the weather. All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY. British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens. The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined. Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie. According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ... I meant me. After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea? They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself. For a man in my position -- As per mother's instructions. The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen. A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor. Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you. Do you really think so? Thank you, Trubshaw ... Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA? Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod. Yes indeed. I need protection. Really? I fail to see the connection. Ah ... From Trubshaw's. My shoemaker. ... Showers followed by sunny periods. I didn't. Mother did. Much better. I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel? Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing. Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules. Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor. Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think? I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since -- I was about to throw in the towel. Doctor Peel, I presume? Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ... It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry. How did you guess? Dead, I'm afraid. Oh, hello ... We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel. Global warming? In your operation. I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole. I was hoping you could tell me. Guilty until proven innocent? You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband? No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all. Impossible. We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ... Anyone particular in mind? How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling? Why? Insane ... ? Amnesia? Think she really killed those agents? Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel -- You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely. Mother. I thought you were burglars. Wonderland Weather Ltd. You don't say. Like looking for a needle in a ... Both, actually. She was ... I feel sure of it. I think so, thank you so much ... I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel? You are, and it's behind you. Did I? My mistake. I do. Rules are made to be broken. One shot -- for emergencies. Bang-bang ... you're dead. I was at Harrow ... Perish the thought. Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ... People, too. Quite right, but we still make the rules. Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning. We have met ... If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass. Eh? In here! Stay by the window. By the window. Walk over to the window ... Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
