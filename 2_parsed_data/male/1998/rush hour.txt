OK. Say what it is. Hey, that's whacked! I thought we was gettin' on here! That's cool. We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter. That's some serious poundage in dollars. Fifty million! Are we talkin' United States dollars? Lee! It's him! You know what a phone booth is?! Do I look like I'm movin'?! What you're seeing here? This is not movement. This is my "still". And that, of course, would be me. Feds asked for me? Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass. Well...you know what I mean. I know, but -- Sir, I can explain. So was I. Tell me about it. I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch! Your ass is goin' to jail! He stole my wheel! Ooo, there's a chill. Love that. No shark fin, no camel hump. What you listenin' to? FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo. Like I'm supposed to drop everything. You know him? Hey, don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen to it. What? Well, I ain't goin' to China. And neither are you. I'm sorry, Lee. You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.? No, wait. I don't have it. You have it. It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up. Take the damn gun. Like that. No, like a tourist. You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit. OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town. This concrete? This is still America. Which one? What?! Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type. No, fish is a PM food. I got to stop that dancing in the street �till all hours. No! You hate me. Look, I'm gonna do it one time. That's it. Not yee-aw, Ya'll. And it's gotta be angry. Like you're pissed off. No, no. It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll. Ya'll! That's not how it goes. You know War? Now, that's American music. No, no. I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas. �scuse me. Yeah, it's good. Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like? Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere. Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant. It happens. You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space. Let's go. Everybody take off? Come on! Yeah, somethin' like that. OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand? OK, let's go. What? When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear? This is my man, you dig? My informant. You know what an informant is? Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'? Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man. Nobody's from here. My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama. So where the hell am I from? Kenya? Hey, stop. We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed. Don't go there... What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb? Bullshit! You were trying' to lose my ass again. Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what? Six hours? It was my ass that almost got trashed! What the hell kinda cop are you?! The license! You get it?! You make the plate? You don't know what a shortcut is? I know a shortcut. Let me just clarify a few things. I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America. Without me you are just another tourist. Right.... You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you? Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole. Oh yeah, but this is on the way. And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet! Wait. You hungry? You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right? Then you gotta be hungry. Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry. We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate. Where were we? Well don't do that. Polite don't work here. You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment. That silly-ass look on your face. -- what the hell is that? Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay? We're gonna be in some deep shit here. Working the danger zone. And you need insurance. Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit. Yeah, that's right. Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that. Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit. You're full of shit. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit? It's the same thing! Bullshit a little. You lied to me. You speak English! Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns. That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell. You have one of these? Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass. You're shittin' me. You know the Beach Boys?! Okay, I'll slow down. So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name? How old are you? You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that. Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat. Not to me. Never to me. Yeah. So why you look do down? You OK? It's okay. For restaurants. That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl! What?! This is a class ride, Johnson. It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on? Oh my god...what happened to you? Alright, Johnson, thank you. So...what are you wearing? This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that? Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something. Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust. No way in the way! I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby. Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it. In Charge. Just me'n him. No interference. They don't even want to hear from us until we're done. I love the F.B.I. I love the F.B.I. Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of. They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type. He is like the baddest Asian shield they got. And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him. Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team. How'd what go? I wouldn't be close to you. What is that perfume, girl? I could get promoted right out of here. Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is? FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it. Hey, baby, it's cool. Captain just reassigned me to the Feds. Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks. Oh, baby, you cruel... You're killin' me here. Not anymore. Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color? What?! Okay, let me start from the top. A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night... No, sir. I'm as good as it gets. Oh yeah. The caller was a man. Confident. Had an accent. My guess, Asian. Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir? Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is. He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity. Hmmmm? Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert! Yo, Johnson... You understand what I'm sayin'? Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese -- What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo? Why don't you assign one of your own men to this? What kind of assignment is that? I'm talking about the girl. Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation... Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte. How much they want? Any demands yet? Where do we find him? I'm waitin' here for a name. All I gotta do is implicate. The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella. You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know... ...this is your MO. You got a boy friend in here yet? �Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye. Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk. I will leave him on this side. Then we trade places. You get him, I get her. Get the picture, Lois? What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package? You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande... With two shots of non-fat milk. Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you. That does nothin' for me. No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop? I oughta pat your ass down. Make sure you're not a cop. This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment. Make him think you don't trust him. You a cop or something? Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it. They asked for the best street man I had. I got a call from the F.B.I. The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it. Good job. That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive. What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy. I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.I want to speak with my daughter! Hello. Please, you must understand, what happened today was not -- Yes. Can I speak with her? My daughter. Yes. Hello. I do. Yes. Griffin? Where are you. Yes. Hello. And Mr. Lee? Where is he? I am so sorry about your men. Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes. He is already on the plane. I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me. I am not an American, Mr. Russ. My daughter is not an American. He is very good. I would like one of my people to help.Oh, I think you like this very much. It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo. My country asked for the best. I told them that was you. Now I will show you around my �hood. What a surprise! Oh my god. Griffin. No, it is China, my country, my history. If any of it gets damaged... The art. Oh no. What are you doing here? Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now. I'm sorry. Oh no, I dropped it. Oh yes. No, please, I don't -- I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women. I am from outa town. What do you hear? This is my territory now. You are my responsibility. Going into the restaurant. It's him. Excuse me? Want some? Are you OK? Good God, ya'll! Yee-aww. Yes, I think so. Who does not know War? �War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.� Yes, I know this song. You want more? That one is my favorite. Chicken puff with shark fin. You like it? Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses. That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph. Thank you. I learn a great deal. Took off. Yes. They took off. You talk too fast. Stool pigeon. Stooly. Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself. And he dropped this. I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America. I could not come. I had other responsibilities. I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years. He wanted me to come with them to America. If I had, this might not have happened. No. I just made it up. When a man steps in dung, it is obvious. There is no need to rub it in his face. The smell is the same. It was a man I was after in Hong Kong. He was trying to kill me, not you. Did you make the plate?! No. What plate? Shortcut? What about them? Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here. It was not my intent -- I thought you were taking me to the consulate. Witnesses. I was being polite. What? I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information. We are both full of shit. Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking. You seemed as if you liked to talk. I like to let people talk who like to talk. It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are. I am not responsible for your assumptions. I didn't say I didn't. You assumed I didn't. A little. No. Help me Rhonda. Beach Boy America. Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my -- Beach Boy. You talk very fast. Soon Young, don't worry. You will have many friends very soon. You will see. America is a very friendly place. I was trying to find the right time. I still have work to do here.The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made. If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter. Shut up! Carter. I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much. What is your name? In used currency. Nothing bigger than a fifty. The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock. The amount will be fifty million. The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity. If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk. You don't move, you understand?! You don't move! Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town. You have twenty-nine minutes left. You have what I asked for? It's Griffin. Han?And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China. Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you. I'm not interested, Carter. You're no longer on this assignment. Why don't you try the assignment. Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it? Don't play bullshit games with me. That's what you were supposed to be! You think this is funny, Carter? You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there! Carter, shut up! What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?! Just make him think you're following leads. Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit. I don't care. I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved. Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we? His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late. Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job. Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident. Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee. He is the situation. ... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances. His name is Lee. And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason. You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent. At this point we don't have much. Don't worry, he's with Carter. Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7. As soon as they pick up the money, we've got �em. Carter, can I have a moment? I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States... As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need. Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again. You have run out of time. The amount now is two hundred million. I will call later with instructions. You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter. She's fine. Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying. Ambassador Han.I will not have friends in America. After I left? I don't believe you. My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin. That is how I found out. When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
