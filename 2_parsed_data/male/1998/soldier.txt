Colonel Mekum has his "boys" unpacked.  I think he wants to show them off. Hmmmmph. They look...impressive. Well, they're...pretty. What's so hot about them? This is Colonel Mekum from Q.  He's their commanding officer. Improved...how? Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying... ...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They are battle-tested, aren't they? The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence... Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new... Sir! Very nice, Riley.  Fall away. Sir! Thirty seconds, 90 percent hits. Sir! Ninety-nine percent... That's...very good. What about endurance? Our man has been out there fifteen minutes now.  Shouldn't you send one? Eight Five, sir. Sir! What are we supposed to do with the old soldiers? Sir. At ease, soldier. What's the price of all that speed? Is he tired? Todd here ran the pace he's been taught to run.  He's still strong. Send him up the chain, Rube. Soldier!  Up the chain! Sir. Sir! What about...spirit? Whatever the latest jargon is. Real men! At ease, Lieutenant. What if they fought? Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. "No"? Romero, A. -- Goines, D.L. -- up the chains. Get him, men! COME ON, DOUBLE IT UP, DOWN, DOWN, Sir! They're...fantastic! Mmmmmmm... We could have a problem here, couldn't we?  I mean, we just lost three men... Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. "Training accident."  Paperwork. What about the bodies? Incinerator. They're very...impressive. It was our best man who got his eye...  Todd, a real tough one. Survived police action in Montana, fought in the Argentine Sector, and in the Saudi Campaign to say nothing of -- Please!  Quiet, please! Just tell me one thing!  How many of them are there and are they armed? There in a man...one man.  He was found in the trench by several children... This man was not armed. He was unconscious.  We couldn't ask him anything.  He -- Nothin' out there.  We couldn't see nobody, couldn't see no ship, no vehicles, nothin'...plus the wind's up again real strong. They're hiding, I bet. Let's everybody calm down right now! We have an injured man among us. One man.  A traveler.  Unarmed. We all want to do the decent thing. The decent thing is to help him. Mace's wife, Sandra, is looking after him now.  Now, I'd like a vote of support on this course of action from all of you. You keep an eye on him, Mace!  You watch him! What do you mean he's survived worse?  Did he say something? A soldier! The Tannhauser Gate was a battle... Where's Nathan? If there's any danger to Nathan -- We're teaching the boy to walk. I got something for you. Here. Like this. See? Practice with it.  In a day or two maybe you'll be strong enough to go out to the garden with Sandra. Let's go.  Come on, Sergeant. You can't talk to a soldier no more than you can talk to a...a...bomb! Or a bullet!  They're trained, they're killing machines.  They got an objective and they go after that objective and nothing stops them but killing them. Just one?  To kill us all? First off, if there's one, there's more.  That's how it is, soldiers travel in bunches.  Second, they don't waste soldiers on folks like us, that's for police!  Training soldiers to kill weaklings like us is not what they call "cost effective." Then who do they fight? Other soldiers!  There's a saying, "Soldiers deserve soldiers." I don't see how you can not remember how you got here, Sergeant. You're not a deserter, are you... Sergeant? No, sir. Then how come you're not with your unit? Oh, come on, Slade, let the man eat. It's not an unreasonable question. How about it, Sergeant? I was...replaced. Replaced? By a better soldier, sir. You children are supposed to be doing lessons. Lessons. She's down now, but she'll come up again.  Always does. That's why we're weighing down.  And that's why we're always on the wire even when the wind's down, like now. You don't get much warning.  Here, load up, you'll want the weight, I promise. Oh, we're not going to shoot anything.  That's not what we mean by "hunting." Jimmy Pig, you're not going to shoot anything, are you? What could I hit? It's how we call for help.  Two shots.  There'll be someone on duty, listening in case we get off the wire and get lost or something.  We have flares too.  Come on. Sandra said she told you how we wound up here.  Our parents and so on. Over here, we call these "catcher trenches." Smaller stuff that blows across the ground, it falls in these trenches, it works sort of like a filter.  We go through the trenches sometimes and get some good stuff. We try to work 'em when they're dry. It's lousy going in there when they're flooded.  You can see... Whatever looks useful, if we can get a rope to it, we'll go for it.  But you can't ever go further than your safety line because it'll come up on you with sometimes maybe ten seconds or even less. Like right now.  You hear that? It's close when you hear that. SHE'S GONNA BLOW, JIMMY. GRAB ON, SERGEANT! Uh, thanks, Sergeant.  Thanks a lot... Dumpers.  They come every twenty or thirty days. Thanks, partner.  These no-goods woulda just let me blow away. We got it all right.  This is an outpost here, not the Third Army! You've got us securing thirty-four locations and erecting monitor units in one month and -- What if we do run into people... say squatters or refugees? Eliminate them, you mean. Down there...is it snowing? Merry Christmas, Captain. Hi, fellas.  At ease! Merry Christmas, everybody. We brought you a little Christmas tree. And some good cheer. How about some Christmas pussy, guys?  Anybody for a quick piece? That's "conduct unbecoming," Sloan. It's Christmas!  Haven't you heard of piece on earth?  "Piece on earth," get it? Christ, I wish we were on Earth. Eat, drink, and be merry, men.  For tomorrow you go on patrol in the  "hostile zone." HO HO HO!  HO HO HO! Fear. Fear. Always. Fear and...discipline. Always.  It makes us...alert. You're not supposed to do that anymore. So what?  I'm a soldier. They're gonna kick him out. They're gonna.  My father -- S-sir...sir, are you our friend? Sh-she said you were our friend. You! Thank God! Well, Riley, you wanted a weapon, right?  Now you got one!  A real biggee! What good'll it do just setting it outside?  We don't know where the enemy is. Doesn't matter.  For once Mekum's on the ball. This is a very dirty bomb!  That wind will churn the radioactivity around like soap in a washing machine.  This is gonna be one clean place in a very short time... Okay, fellas, take it about a hundred yards, then get back on the double...unless you wanna fry. THIRTY MINUTES IS AWFUL TIGHT!  WE IT'S ENOUGH.  IF WE LEAVE MORE THAN Right horizontal? Roger.  Right horizontal checks green. All right we're "go."  I'm allowing us three minutes to clear the atmosphere and get out of range. That means we can wait seven more minutes. Fuck 'em!  Let's just go! She's right!  Four more casualties aren't gonna mean anything to anybody, especially when they're already obsolete. I guess they wouldn't want to get old anyway. Go ahead, lock the hatch. Rube, punch up the port power cluster and -- What was that? Huh?  What was what? Sssshhhh!  Listen! It sounds... Like a kid! Are you crazy?  You can't do this, soldier!  You're going to be in trouble. I'm your superior officer, don't you understand that? Don't you realize you're violating the chain of command?  I'm giving you a direct order to...to...to... S-sergeant?  S-sergeant T-todd? It...  You...!  How...?  How...? Sergeant Todd! Listen, you don't understand!  That bomb is triggered!  It's on a timer! We have to get out of here!  All of us!  You need us!  You need us to operate the ship... YOU'RE FUCKING MORONS!  CAN'T YOU NO!  NO!  NO! DOWN!  LIE DOWN!  FLAT! NO!  NO!  NO!  PLEASE!  NO! OH, MY GOD!  OH, MY GOD! THERE IT IS!  I SEE IT! Twenty seconds.  Hurry. Oh, my God, I can't remember if it's six-seven or seven-six... Try one! Try it! There!  I did it!  Did it stop?  Did it -- ? ...I need a report, Captain.  It's not just my ass, it's yours too! You've got to stand by me on this. I want you to come in right now... right now!  Do you understand me? Right now! This is important for all of us, for our careers.  There's going to be a Board of Inquiry and -- That was the boss, huh? Well then, I guess you fellas are all right.  I guess I misjudged you some.  Where I said you were "a buncha no good killer robots," I mighta just overspoke myself.  As of now, till it goes otherwise, you got my sincere approval and support. Cold. Air? Safe? But very cold. That one. Aye, aye, sir.
