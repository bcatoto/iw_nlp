Oh the preacher's getting angry again... Tell me something. Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her? Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face -- A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife? Crushed her like a bug. Snapped her bones? You need a ride, Preacher? Are you a preacher? Mine.It's hard to say. It's a delicate surgery. There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation. We operate. We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine. It can, but it'll have to wait in line. The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion. This is called, "Claudication," As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body. That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls. You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day. You're feeling old and you want to start exercising. A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth. Don't feel embarrassed about it. I've seen it before. I know what you're getting at. Yes -- you are. I mean why the sudden voluntary visit -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here... So what's the deal Maurice?You don't have to prove anything to her. Doubts? About what? That's a reasonable assumption. Most certainly. Why? I see. From where? To where? I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now. If I had seen you. By the way I'm sorry about your wife. They told me.Here comes the resume. This smells good. Adelle... Maurice is in the paper. For a walk. I don't know. He probably just went somewhere.Jumped where? I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back. P-A-R-K-E-R. Right. Get on the horn with Philly. Call me here. A marriage certificate? Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around? If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses. It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house. Why so vague? Why so evasive? He could be somebody hot. Red flags man. Red flag, man. What's his story?You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again. Nine. That's me. You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run. You tell stories? You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up. Yeah! You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon. You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger. I'm Isaac... I'm three.Maybe. Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me. God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden. What are you saying? This story is too big for this paper? Mammoth. She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now. Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help. But I'm not risking your life. Don't do this. I do. I can't do it. I want you to finish, but I want you to live more. Come on Mr. Parker. Saluting. I was thinking you could open another store with investors. I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now. You were right. From the heart is always better. I missed you to Mr. Parker. You're amazing. Tom Joad? What Mr. Parker? Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away. Why know? I'm really lost. What does this have to do with walking? She knew you loved her. Oh, a coastal city. That's good. You're walking to California? You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker? Phileas Fogg? The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening. Walking where? When are you leaving? Where? You going on a trip Mr. Parker? Are you firing me? This is a ghost town. Nothing ever happens. I want to reach people. Nobody listens to me. This is my way to reach them. What happened? Pulitzer, here I come. They called her 'Lizy' in the book... Sorry I was late. My jeep died on the way over from the paper. You're amazing.I have to finish first. I'm completing the walk. I'm almost there. I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want. Then it'll have to wait until I finish. How serious is it? You should definitely have children. They're really special. Are you two planning kids? Nothing's going to happen. I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again. No it's not. I'll make it. You'd be visiting me at Nasa. It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do. I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch. Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand. I have new dreams now. High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles. They're nasty. I'll kill you! That's enough. This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you. No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance. Are you and your friends planning on driving soon? What are the odds? Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation? What steps do we take now? Can it kill me? Twenty miles? I see. Just for curiosity sake that's all? No. How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk? Okay. You have? You do? I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar. Routine, I assure you. I just wanted to gage my health. Am I healthy? Pardon? The beach of Pacifica, California. Go to sleep Ellen. Yes. Why there? Where? Did you have a dream? I don't know. No it's not. He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker. He's never been there for me. I've always been alone. He's plastered. It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly. Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases. Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway. ... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway. I don't want us to be that way Ellen. Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world -- You've just decided, is that right? You can't change your mind. I thought we both wanted the same things. Please tell me. No. But I want to take a walk with you. Walk with me? I will -- I promise. I do love you... very, very much. There's no reason. No. A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing. You're talking to me? What do you want from me? Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you? Yes... Yes I would. You know that. Yes. You don't think I love you? Is this going to be similar to the flower incident? I don't follow. What's that? That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune. What you have is a statement. It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving. The new store? Ellen? It's a special day isn't it? Have I forgotten something? Is this a special day? You thought I sent them? Yes? I'm not proving to her. I'm showing her. And I know I don't have to. I want to. I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can. About my love for her. I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts. And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them. Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death? Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pacifica, California. Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie. It must have been difficult. What did they ask? Okay nine. Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base. That's when Isaac came up. He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium. Everyone cheered. Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play. Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together. The end. Right. But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy. He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game. It came to the end of the game. It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game... Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands. 'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove. Who's telling this story? There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove. Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact... Your parents would want you to be in bed. I thought you were asleep. You'll probably be bigger than your brothers. Is that right? I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three. Are your parents home? Well, hello. By car right? Perhaps there's another route? Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand? Making the grand total? No more words. Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words. It's mine to risk. ... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me? To tell me you know what's best? To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife? Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then? We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing. What, come on? Are they standing? I haven't been too punctual with the rent. Adelle told me, your writing is going well. The Crusader for social issues and all. I missed you Kris. ... The Grapes of Wrath. She never ate a slice. Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles... And you know what Kris? So I've been informed. Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her. I need to show her how much I love her Kris. I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me. She wasn't certain... I never really showed her. Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her. Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city. I told you. ... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris. I always knew you had good instincts... Goodbye Kris. I'll see you when I get back. California. I'm walking there Kris. Tomorrow. California. Yes. No. No... I won't be here for a while. The store will be closed in the interim. Write from your heart. That's why the classics are great. To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things. How can you feel for dog food? The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you. Never have children. If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else. They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening. It has to be a full character's name. Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett... Pride and Prejudice. You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back. Did you tell him everything you wanted to? Did you do everything you could while he was here? You ever lose somebody Stephanie? I need your help. Do you have a car, Steph? What do your friends call you? Which hospital? Did you take me back? Where am I? May I ask you a question that might sound strange? Where did he go? You look so happy -- how long have you been married? I don't have kids. Oh, that's not mine. Good morning. What? Who are you? What do you mean? Confused. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not sure what he wants for me. Hello. This isn't right. It's yours. Evening News?This is my only chance to get a watch like that. It would mean a lot to me and my family. Please take it. It really isn't that much. I really want that watch. No. I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that. I've always wanted a watch like that. We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times. If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell. I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.What's your shoe size? I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily. He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here. How are you feeling? Hello, Mr. Parker.
