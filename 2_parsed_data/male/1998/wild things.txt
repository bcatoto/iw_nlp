I... You know... I... The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle. You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam. You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one. All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there. They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay... Sam... I... Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long. She's pushing for suspension... Kelly Van Ryan... So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too... Ray. Stop calling. I told you the dental records will take time... Merritt, Forensics. We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer. You want DNA, that can take weeks.I don't care. You heard that girl's statement. I think he's dirty. Get me a case. I want a full-scale investigation. Where's this coming from? Why? Suzie Toller's. And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass. You didn't cuff her? She bit you? Just tell us what happened. Get off this Ray, now. If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide. You get an ID, you call me. Oh, Ray... no... Ray. The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible. What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick... Are you crazy, Ray? And what do they say? What about witnesses? The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay. Your Honor... Please... I'm sorry? Ms. Toller. I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you? Ms. Toller? I'm sorry... you said it hurt? Why? Suzie! Did this man rape you? What did you do then? And then what... he touched you? Did you maybe flirt a little... You guess? Did he or didn't he?Yeah. But I got my bike. What? You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class... No way was my old man going to spring for the fees... Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate. No! Yeah, but... No. But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would... Yeah, sometimes. Lots of the kids hang out here. You really think something bad happened to Suzie? It's those rocks, up there.Just like that? These people ruined your life, bro. You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan. Come on, let loose! Fair enough. Let's go make a statement. Good. So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep. We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back. They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution... Sound nice? It's a fucking drug rehab farm. It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp. Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury. Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet. Reason? They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty. Now tell me I'm right. For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up. Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared. And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless. You're not in bad shape, really. I know you think you are, but you're not. Let me tell you why. Sandra Van Ryan. Not in here. Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes. Lady has some deep pockets. That's all I'm saying. You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan... But check this...Second you get something on those teeth, I want it What about the blood? The teeth doin' any talkin'? How soon can we get something? The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's. Where's Lombardo? If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise. Stick with me on this Gloria. I need you... What if I'm right, Gloria? What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong? What do you do if you see a bad thing coming? Will you do me one favor? Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance. You don't think Sam could've put it there? The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there. But he's made a mistake. Those are Suzie Toller's teeth. Just check out the car. I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me? It's starting, Gloria. This is how it begins... I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened. I did that once. I don't want to do it again. Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it? Guess I kind of lost it there. What? You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter? Cone on. She bought the same story we did... I net a guy in a bar. You got it. The rich got richer. While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp. I flat don't like the guy, Glory. He's dirty. And I'll tell you something else. You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money? He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal. It was after the war. Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him. The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it. Her father didn't leave her squat. The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck. The job looks okay to us. But look at it from his point of view. The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his. They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start. Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday. I thought of that. Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo. Your reputation is getting trashed. You want to stop the bleeding. You don't want to sit in jail for three months. Unless... Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial. Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right? So why not tell us about the affair? I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place. You saw the news today? It's a shithole. But she was dirty, what was I gonna do? This is where she lives. She wants to talk. Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all. I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine. You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay? Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his. I don't imagine he gives a shit now. You're telling me you believe the guy? Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her. I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt? It's our job, Gloria. That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide. You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior? I've got that two o'clock in town. The teeth, were they... She looked shaky, but lucid. I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door... I think I looked away. A split second. Then, bingo. Just like that. She puts a knee into my groin. There was this coffee table between us and the wall. She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case. Thing had a glass door. I could hear it breaking. I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough. Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun. I yelled at her to put it down. She got off a shot. I took it in the shoulder. I... I had no choice. I returned fire. Two rounds, I think. In the chest. I told her I was coming with her. She nodded, like she understood. We stood up together. Bit, scratched. But I had her pinned. She calmed down. I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick. She asked to use the bathroom. I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder. I did her rights. I fucked up. I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do? Kelly's next, Gloria. You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish? Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath. And those girls are going to wind up dead... I don't believe I'm hearing this. A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse. They were acting. They were all acting, from the beginning. And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money. You heard Kelly say "Sam." That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the girls... We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops. Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her. That's bullshit. Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for... Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys... I say something funny? Lombardo ever come out here? You and Suzie used to come out here together? I'm not on your property! Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly. I've been a cop for a while, Kelly. It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three. And then there's the love angle. I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money? The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out. You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together? Curiosity, I guess. Suzie Toller is dead. You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way. I'm placing your daughter under arrest. Where is she? Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan. Let me in. Now. You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo. Sam, for godsake. You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him... That's right. That was his name. Don't you see what this means? You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money? You, the pill-head with the rap sheet? Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to. We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit... Is that what you think? You have friends? Is that what they told you? You, Kelly, Sam. Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go. Well, you're half right. Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me. Yeah, they're bad for your health. I'm tryin' to look out for you... You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie. You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser. It doesn't look like it. No. So Suzie, you called us, remember? Meet my partner, Gloria Perez. That how you planned it? You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean... Yeah, or get me drowned. I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat? You mean this thing? Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle? Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it. We should be celebrating. This thing worked out just like you said, only better. Hey, what did you want me to do, die? The bitch shot me, is what happened. Sit down, Lombardo. With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra... But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her. Isn't that against the rules? But she ran away. And she began to cry. And you put an arm around her. But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about. And she wanted to talk. In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt. The one you bought at school. Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.How you doing, Artie? That's great. I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist. No problem... Shit. I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it. This is insane. ... is accusing me of rape. Jimmy told me. Apparently I'm the last to know... Talk to me Artie. I have the feeling, they got it down already. They're a step ahead of us, Artie. I'd like that. I was thinking, Antigua, maybe. Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right? I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner. You look pretty. Senior class fund-raising gig. I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep. Hey, come on. It's for a good cause. Kelly. Eat a power bar. Kelly's file. Read it. You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify. I don't know what to say... Maybe she used another name. How long? Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows? There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house. There's phones there. I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found. I don't know... Maybe I should have called. But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself. I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office. No. Again. I think we covered this. I told her I was going to call a cab. If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda. I'll see you get a proper tour. A ride. You want one? What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride? Hey, you're working for it. Least you're supposed to be. Thank you, Jimmy. Come on. Beats study hall, doesn't it? You think that's wise? I love you. Now give me the line. That's not your line. So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead. Stay in the guest house. Skip the graduation parties. You'll never see Duquette. Okay? I love you. Kelly... Relax. Take one of your mom's valium or something. In another week you get on the plane. It's over. We're rich. And you believe her? Yeah, he got her busted for possession... Duquette. Forget him... Hello. I'm sorry, Kelly. I'm sorry it had to happen like this. She was losing it... Okay. I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool. All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake. I'm doing what rich guys do. I'm spending my money. It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing. Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds. Then do it. I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight. We'll figure something out... Okay? No! Christ. Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you. You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes... Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down? Kelly. Is Suzie there? We have to stick with the plan. The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves... From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental. I thought that was understood... God, you scared the shit out of me. You must be crazy coming here. About six and a half million dollars. Jesus Christ, what are you doing? Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning. Kelly... All right. I'll have to look for it. Jeez, that thing... Can't you... So, where you off to now? In back of the garage. No I didn't. Check out the Jeep. It's nice and dirty for you. But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving. I won't. Okay, try me on Sunday. I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday. You guys can wash the mud off. Just like that? I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay. I lost the house. It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare. I just want my life back... There's nothing for them to get. Nellie Gail Ranch... What's that supposed to mean? Can't you take that stupid thing off? I know how deep her pockets are, Ken. I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank? Forget it. Good thinking. Ken. I'm in some trouble. I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here. Come off it, man... It was an accident. Jesus, man... You okay? Come on, man. I'll make a sailor out of you yet. Yes, we call it a winch. And these are shrouds, and these are stays. Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed. What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises. Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something? You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake. Yeah, well, you fixed that. What the hell happened, anyway? Fuck you. This is bullshit. I'm outta here. It is and I don't. Ordinarily... But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying... That's right. Yes. Mainly to turn her toward the door. I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office. I could, but it's confidential. Look, the point is, we didn't talk. I told her this was not an appropriate time or place. Yes. Yes. Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it. Anyway, I'm going through a drawer. I hear a car. I look out the window. I see Nicole driving away. I leave my room, and there's Kelly. I had to go look for this coupon. Story's the same, Detective... I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them. How... We? Yeah, real funny. You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot. What's wrong? That was the same thing Ray said. But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on... That was about as grim as it gets. No, no. Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play. We'll go through it all again tonight. I was worried about you, Suzie. I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up. Good. Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us. Shut up. Don't fall apart. The only people who can blow this is us. Remember? Put Kelly on too. Jesus. Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change. Goodbye, Sandra. So maybe I'm a one-woman man. Didn't you see her this morning? No. Sandy... What's up? Swamp's where it's at, Sandy. Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of. You ought to try it some time. Sorry, Sandy. I've got plans. I can't, Sandy. I've got to run. Can't. Got a passenger. Hi, Sandy.
