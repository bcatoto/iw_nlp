I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts. All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter. Sorry. Emergencies only. Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it. July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork. And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need. Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites. You're in 201 and 202. What can I do for you? Phones went down a few minutes ago. Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days. Who? Who is here? It's our version of winter. 201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy. Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet? Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --The guy looks dead. I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone -- No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched. Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb. Stupid. What were you thinkng? Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere. There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out. Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain. Get lost, you scared me.Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period. Don't really have the market for something like this... I can go two...two-fifty. Well, there's some flaws in her... Jeez, that's a full carat --We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station? Oh, no...Did you say Rio? Okay, Karla, five seconds. Five...Four... How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway? Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?No. I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming. Stupid. Stupid. You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me? Checking the locks again? It's gonna be great. Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay. We got the refrigerator in. Come see. Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. Did I scare you? Okay, I'll try. But, listen... If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time. Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it. This weekend? What? The Bahamas? You're kidding. No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just... Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry. I understand something. Can't what? Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first. Yeah. I got in early. I was excited... Who was that guy? I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring. Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too. How much? How much?Up-tighteous and self-righteous. Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones. That's why you'll come with Titus, mon. Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.Don't kill me -- You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this -- You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer? I told you. Who? Fine. Show me the body. That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance? You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules. I don't know, but I'm starving. I'm not hiding up no tree. I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt. I'll come with you. Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho. See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason? Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode. I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle. Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care. Hello? Why? Pretty cool bar. Guess the capital of Brazil -- Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical! We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves. Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining. Is there a problem here? Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me. I'll talk real slow. Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you. You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone. Must have missed the sign. And so could you -- crazy fool. The rest of us see bathrobes. Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet. He leave you? What's the matter, boy trouble? Tell me this ain't the bar scene. What is up with that weirdo? Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place. Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first. They were cut loose. Take this. Hey -- shut up, okay? They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners. Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something. Where is everybody? I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time. Crowded. There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us. The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard. Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai? Can't talk right now.Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son. We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right. Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend. I guess so. Estes came after me with a gaffing hook. Come on. We're gonna be okay. Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming. What? What are you talking about? Where? Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand. I'm going to take a walk and dry off. I scared you -- I crossed the line -- It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think... What do you mean, Julie? Julie? What's wrong? You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand. You sure it's okay with you? And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend. Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes. Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all. What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute... Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second. I said, this...Do you want a drink? This was not my idea. Are you sure? Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school... Are you okay? To get out of Southport? It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself. It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better. I'm sorry. The shower again? You don't seem fine. You sure? Julie! Wait! You okay? He's probably the only one who can help us. Alone. In the room. Got any advise? Ahh, that feels great. Come on, it'll be fun. Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather! Julie, is everything cool? Karla said... I'll go find him. Where'd Estes go? We'll only be a second, okay? The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos -- Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here? And do what with it? You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression -- They're all dead...Dead, I tell you. Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss. You don't have to be a jerk. How's the water? So why are you still here? We didn't get all dressed up for nothing. See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it. Some folks just can't sail.
