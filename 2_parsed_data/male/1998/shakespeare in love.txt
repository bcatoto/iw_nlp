He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out. And you are a Warwickshire shit-house. Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion. The title won't do. It's good. The speech is excellent. "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible. Will�Where is Mercutio? And the title of this piece?Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child. Thank you, my lady! Writer, is he? Sir Robert De Lesseps. I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once. Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king. I know your face. Are you an actor? Right you are, governor!Treachery! I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo! Never! What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare. Wait! Will you desist! Tomorrow. You have the last act? What do you want, Kit? We will all be put in the clink. No Juliet?! Ask him. The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us. Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages. Ned is wrong for it. You're a liar. How much? I will play him. Bring it tomorrow. The title? What is the chief part? Are you writing? Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men? There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week. So now you are free to love No, your marriage bed. And your relations? A woman of property? No, no. You have a wife, children How long has it been? Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love? Most interesting. Interesting. I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words. Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and And yet you tell me you lie with women?That's me. By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary! Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful. Who is that? Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so. Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary! Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business But nothing is happening. Is it going well? Where is the play? How? So what do we do? by order of the Master of the Revels! The theatres are all closed by the plague! This time we take your boots off! Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter�Almost finished? Of course not! A share of the profits. Good title. What's the title? Partners! And his ears. Cut his nose off. Put his feet in. Take his feet out. Where will you get When?See you in jail. We have no Juliet! And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you? Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket. Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles. The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end? I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business Yes, but very well. Very well. Oh, it's coming, it's coming. I don't know. It's a mystery. Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well. Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre. Oh, that. What have I done, Mr. Fennyman? Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment. Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something. There's never any But I have to pay the actors and the authors. Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant. And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman! A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare! It's a comedy. I have a wonderful new play! Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake. Do you know it? Who are you? it will be all right, madam. It is over. Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this! I don't know. It's a mystery. Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right. The show must � you know Another little problem. I don't know, it's a mystery. No, it will turn out well. By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife! Juliet? You mean Ethel. The one who came with your letter? What? Who? It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it. Nobody. The author. We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster. Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages? My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo? Will! Have you finished? Rosaline? You mean Ethel. Is it about a pirate's daughter? Now where? Will? Where are you going? Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs! Fifty pounds? What for? Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since. No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel? Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful - Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet? Who is she this time?! God be praised! Locked? No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play? Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started. You have begun?You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose. Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline. Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe. Twenty pounds on delivery Then tomorrow you will have the pages. You have the money? My Massacre at Paris is complete. A different one you haven't written? I thought your play was for Burbage. His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio. The daughter of his enemy. Ethel. Romeo is�Italian. Always in and out of love. What is the story? And yours? I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris. Not new--my Doctor Faustus. Burbage says you have a play. How goes it, Will?"Of love?" It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?" "But new struck nine." "Good morrow, cousin.""Madam!" "Madam!" "I know not.""Parting is such sweet sorrow�" It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday. Master Shakespeare No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away. I am, Master Shakespeare.By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!" "I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--" "�All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world." "Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed." "What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?" I would not for the world! "Ay me." "Then have my lips the sin that they have took." "Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag. She will breed. If she do not, send her back. She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off. I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives. I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus. I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse. I will. Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?! Not ready? Where is she? It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master. Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance! Two hours at prayer! Fifty shillings. Pounds. Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end? Your Majesty! Your Majesty I like her. Is she obedient? My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile? Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing. And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house. I understand of course. It is to be expected. Bless me, I thought it was a horse. You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding. Lady Viola is�young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune. Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you! She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief. Will you defy your father and your Queen? It was your eyes. No, your lips. Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . . How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia. Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. You are allowed to show your pleasure. No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command. I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege. My lady VIOLA. I have spoken with your father. My lady Viola. By God, I'll fight the lot of you You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell! That dog! An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house? There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house? Is there a man? On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps Are you bringing your laundry woman? By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name? "Poet?"Oh�what have I done? You are a gentleman. Thank you, Ned. Ah Oh Ned�I know�I know You did not like the speech? Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write. Mercutio We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona Lady? Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box. Do you know that house? Really? Yes. Follow that boat! Done. I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men. Ten pounds. It's for Henslowe. He paid me. Romeo Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover. A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful. When I have fifty pounds. I am still owed money for this play, Burbage. Will it restore my gift? yet cannot love nor write it. Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing. On my mother's side the Ardens She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so A goodly length in times past, but lately It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring. Nothing comes. I have lost my gift. It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed. Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift. Words, words, words�once, I had the gift�I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones�for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery�but now And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead. I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary. Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role. Yes, I saw it. Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome. How will it? Go on. What do we do now? How will it? We are lost. By God, I wish I knew. God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?! What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life? What? Romeo. Cut round him for now. You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go We are about to embark on a great voyage. We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster. Tomorrow I did not. Yes. Nearly. It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part. Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good! I feel a scene coming on. To the Palace at Whitehall. To my weekly confession. No, then. Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over. Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds? Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona. Who wrote that? What piece? Richard Crookback? Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate? She is always Aphrodite. As soon as I have found my muse It is all locked safe in here Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move This is a different one. Good luck with yours, Kit. Mercutio�good name. The daughter of his enemy. Do you think? Yes, that's good. Until he meets Well, there's a pirate In truth, I have not written a word. Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. Yes, I know. Good title. I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?" I hear you have a new play for the Curtain. I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business. I have. And chinks to show for it. Wonderful, wonderful. Kit I would have made you immortal. Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare. Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE? I have lost my gift. Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line. Luck be with you, Sam. Sam�? Master Henslowe, you have your actors. But your voice Have they dropped? Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again? But the plague You have opened the playhouses? So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men. I have to get back. Oh. What is your name? You admire it? Better fortune, boy. I'll be damned if you are! Who are you, master? Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye. You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die. How does it? and thus unable to declare her love Orsino�good name Sold in marriage and half way to America. A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love? I have hurt you and I am sorry for it. I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us. "�thou need'st not to be gone." "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale." No�no. You cannot marry Wessex! Oh, my love You ran from me before. I was the more deceived. My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed. He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come. Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations. A literary feud. Quite normal. I know how to fight! Then I will go with you. To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day. You cannot! Not for the Queen herself! In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature. I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies. Oh, but it is mine too! "Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?" Yes, some of it is speakable. I must. I must It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl. There is time. It is still dark. Let him be damned for his pages! Oh, let Henslowe wait. No, the morning rooster woke me. I must. Look-- how pale the window. Well perhaps better than my first. Oh There is. It is strange to me, too. I am. Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent. Can you love a fool? You can bring them with a word. Oh my lady, my love! Oh--I am him too! A lowly player. The same, alas. Will Shakespeare! My lady! It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink. For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes! Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden! Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples! Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom? Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song. Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy! Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself. Like a sickness and its cure together. Your aunt? No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this? She loves me, Thomas! And break her heart and mine? She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do? Of course you have not! I have not written it! He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet? Do you understand me? Let me see you. Take off your hat. Wait there. Where did you learn how to do that? Take off your hat. Your name? You are on my ground. Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry. A theatre poet? A man, my lord? Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches! Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin. My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina! Here we come at last, my lord! Christopher Marlowe at your service. How do I offend, my lord? I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
