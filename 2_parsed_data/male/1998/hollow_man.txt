Damnit. Damnit. I am a goddamn genius. You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it  was waste of time. Who s that? Touche. I cracked the reversion. Look at this. Watch this. 91% sure. The usual. Coffee and twinkies. I know. You think you could hunt down  Matt and get to the lab early. I want  Isabelle prepped for a live test. Well y know. It s daylight in  Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel Committee and tell them to get our prizes ready. See you in a few. What? Shit! You didn t tell him I was here,  did you? So what s the rush? Wanna ride down? You re gonna have to tell him about us  eventually. Morning, Ed. Sorry, Ed. You know the rules. Authorization please. Caine zero zero two seven. Authorization verified. Good morning,  Dr. Caine. Isabelle ... Calm down baby. Calm down. It s  okay... It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not  going to hurt you. Come here. Just hold still.   Ow, shit. She bit me. And give you a chance to pull ahead?  Never. Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting  simians.   heheheheh. Good shootin , Tex. I m still ahead. 6 to 5. Most normal people say good morning. How many tissue samples have we  successfully regressed? Hundreds,  right? How many have gone on to work  on the full system? None. No, that is the point. I m not going  to waste six months of my life on an  outmoded testing procedure. This thing  works. I know it. I feel it. You think I m going to kill Isabelle? Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but  I m the project leader. Understand? How did you ever convince me to hire  her? Yeah, well she cares more about the  animals than the research. Who da Man? You da Man. As we pull out we see we are. Protocol is hot. Vitals? THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE How many times do I have to tell you,  Frank you aren t God. I am. Sorry, Boss. Forgot. You guys ready to roll? We are live and in color. On your  mark. Okay. Roll  em. Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in  phase shift... one hundred twenty six  days, eighteen hours. Maybe if you stopped naming them after  yourself, you d have better luck. Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for  that keen scientific observation. I ll  be sure to include it in my memoirs. A whole mention? And I thought I was  just gonna be a footnote. Okay. Ready. Let s make some history. Nice try, Sparky. Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal  range. It s reacting. Do you see this? Subject began manifesting almost  Immediately. Protocol is reacting  quickly. What? What problem! I got an erratic heart beat. No! It s got to work. Do it. Do it. Come on. Brain activity returning to normal. How is she? Amazing. She's normal, absolutely  healthy. If you didn't know any  better, you'd think nothing had  happened to her. Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her  brain and trace her neural pathways. Well maybe not right away. To the finest research team I've ever  known. Hey... Where would I go? Twenty years ago there were no  computers, no fax machines, no cell  phones. I was just wondering what the  world will be like twenty years from  now... if what we're doing will change  everything. Something like that. Actually it does. I guess since you were there from the  beginning, you know me better than  anyone else on this godforsaken  planet. Yeah... but I was working so hard, I  didn't realize I'd have no one to  share it with. I don't suppose we could turn back the  clock for a night and you could come  home with me? Right. Sorry. Too much champagne. What was that about? What's it like? Talk goddamnit! Tell  me what it's like! Six years ago, this committee  commissioned me with a very specific  task... To successful phase-shift a human  being out of quantum sync with the  visible universe and then return him  safely, with no after affects. Well, we found out sending them to  "never-never-land" was easy, it's the  getting back that's hard. Every time we've tried to bring a test  subject back from phase-shift.  Cellular bonds would dissolve, the  primary DNA strands would decay. But  now... But now... But now? But now... But now, we feel we are closer than  ever to resolving this issue. We've  been experimenting with a new  regression formula that looks rather  promising. A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward. How long? Sir? Son, as you can imagine, we are very  anxious to field test this tactical  asset. How long till you resolve this  issue? Shouldn't be more than another year,  Sir. Maybe sooner. Yo. Reality check! What the hell was  that about? Keep your voice down. The protocol works. Why'd you tell  them it didn't? I wasn't ready for them to know. But they're the oversight committee.  They're supposed to know. I had more than a reason. I had a  goddamn epiphany. What do you think they'd do if they  know we could send a subject into  phase shift and pull it back out  again? How many seconds would it take  for them to take over the whole  project, bringing in their soldiers to  test the formula on. We'd have lost  control of it by the end of the week. I know. But not yet. There's too much  for us to learn. I don't want my hands  tied by their political agenda when we  go to phase three. Well, then... mind telling us how  you're gonna get a human test-subject  for phase three without the committee  finding out? That's easy. I've decided to test the  procedure ... ... on myself. Are you nuts? Was Jonas Salk nuts? Yeah. Pretty sure he was. And remember, for every Jonas Salk,  there are a bunch of guys who aren't  famous cuz they died. If we're that unsure, how can we  morally justify testing it on someone  else? We'll have plenty of time to collate  and cross-reference later. Monkey data  doesn't matter anyway. The only real  data is human data. How are we gonna find out? Besides,  we've succeeded with a gorilla and  their DNA is 98% the same as humans.  And the 2% is not that significant. We're all concerned. I know that. But  if we're gonna move forward ever, this  is something we have to do. The risks. I couldn't ask... What if we volunteer? I'm Project Leader. It's my formula  and my call. The best way to express  your concern is to make damn sure you  do your best work. I'll want about  four weeks to... To put your affairs in order? To run some more reversions and tissue  tests and then we'll attempt the phase  shift. I'll stay shifted for three  days of testing and then we'll perform  a quantum regression. Come in. What? You don't understand. Lin, trust me... nothing's going to  happen. Can we talk about this later? I'm  trying to make love to you. I know how you're feeling. Hell, he  and I've been friends since freshman  year. What if you were given the opportunity  to be the first person on ,Mars, would  you go? What if they didn't know whether or  not they could get you home? This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager  or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I  were him I'd do the same thing. Is about who gets to be on top? Why do you always get philosophical  before we're about to get physical? They said the same thing about the  bomb. They said we'd never survive the  nuclear age... but here we are. We made our deal with the devil years  ago. Might as well stick around to  cash in. Yes? We're ready. Okay. It's not too late to back out. I'm  happy to take your place. No. I'm ready. Nervous? A little. Ever tell you the one about Superman  and Wonder Woman? I don't think so. So Superman's flying around the city,  and he's horny as hell.  Lo and behold  he looks down and sees Wonder Woman,  completely nude, sunning herself up on  the roof of the Justice League. I mean  she is lying there naked and spread  eagle. So Superman starts thinking,  "man... this is too easy. I could go  down there, do a little fast pumping  and be gone before she even sees me."  After all he is faster than a speeding  bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down,  takes care of business so quick, you  can't even see him. Well ... I tell  ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised  as hell and says "What the hell was  that." And the Invisible Man replies  "I dunno know, but it sure hurt like  hell." You know, that could be the last joke  I ever hear. C'mon, man. That's funny shit. Fine. To be expected. Hey... it's gonna be okay. Okay, kids. Let's make some history. Ready. If the tests are any indication it  should work quickly. I'll inject myself. If anything goes  wrong, they can't blame you. Any last words? Yeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said  something deep and clever. Nothing so far. Human DNA structure is slightly more  complex... it's possible that it may  take more time... Recheck the protocol. It can't be non-  reactive. Kinda like a firecracker with a bad  fuse... Don't know if it'll go off. No change in bio-electric. Goddammit. Okay wait, my arm... it's getting a  bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's  starting to tingle... Okay... it's spreading to my back...  like, like a fever... Shit... it's starting to burn... Oh  god. It hurts. I didn't think it would  hurt. Pain! He's going to blow out his heart. We've got to stop it! Listen up! Electric activity  increasing in all limbs. Brainwaves  are through the roof. Maybe it can't. No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!  Holy shit. Is he dead? Electrical activity is stabilizing. Un-fucking-believable. Let's get him into recovery. S'okay. You nodded off. Seventeen hours. In the lab crunching numbers. We've  got enough data there for two  lifetimes of research. He may be coming out of it. The lights! Turn off the goddamn  lights! Ah Christ! I can't... I can't close my eyes. I  can't close my eyes. So I ... I'm... My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel  them... Mirror. I ... I want to see. Over here in the corner. What was it like? I ... It's hard to think. The transformation... I remember every  molecule in my body shattering. It was painful? At first... but then everything went  black. I couldn't see or hear or feel  anything. It was all just black...  like I wasn't connected. At least my senses are starting to  return... You're wearing your  Shalimar, aren't you? This is weird. I'm looking through  myself at the floor. I'm looking right  through myself. I can't tell ... ... where my body is. Sebastian? You really can't see me. Can you? No, just tired. It's funny. I can see everything...  more than before... but I can't see  myself. Hey. How's he doing? Not to bad, considering. Odd, isn't it? Over here. Sorry. Couldn't resist. I feel like we're playing Marco Polo. Well, I see the procedure hasn't  changed your personality. No worries. I'm on it. Gotcha, big man. Boy, you people have no sense of  humor. Show me. So ... Stop there. Index that. That was when it started  burn. Epidermal reaction. Just a little longer. Fine. Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote  the procedure. You like this don't you? Being in charge. Man, I'm tired. That was a long day. Sarah. Are you awake? Hmm. It doesn't sound like something  Sebastian would do. You sure? So, how was your first night? Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't  close your eyes. Yeah? What'd you do? Got up a couple of times. Knocked  about. Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in  your cubicle. She said she called you  over the intercom and you didn't  respond. I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio  on. It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell  whoever's on duty where you're going  to. I mean, if something were to  happen, we'd want to know where to  find you. I didn't think it was a problem. It isn't. I just don't want it to  become one. Readings are normal. Next I want to run a VV and UVF  analysis of the platelets. We'll have to draw some more blood. You okay? You just seem a little nervous. No. I was looking at the clock. Why? You've no idea how much fun I've had.  I'm going to hate going back. How so? Maybe we won't give it to them. His  voice comes from behind her now. I was thinking... tonight's my last  night. Ever fantasize about making  love to an invisible man? Well, don't do it for me. Do it for  science. Oh well. Missed your big chance. Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian  Caine. Currently in phase shift...  Three days, seven hours. Not really. I was just starting to  enjoy myself. Okay, man. Here we go. Wait... something... something doesn't  feel right. Vitals still nominal.. I can't br... br... Subject manifesting. Get a tranq. Stat. Start CPR. Getting a pulse. Holy shit. What happened? I can't see his goddamn pupils! Just got the tissue sample results.  Cellular cohesion is stable. How bout you? You gonna be okay? Sometimes the test pilots make  history. Sometimes the planes crash  and people die. It's just a little hitch is all. He'll  be the first to tell that he'll crack  it and I'm sure he will. It'll just  take time. Listen, let's got out of here. We  could drive up to the old observatory.  We'll take some wine and go count the  stars and forget all this for awhile. Hey... So I guess it didn't work. You look worried. It must've been bad. Well, remember your Nietchze. Whatever  doesn't kill me, makes me stronger. I guess if I'm going to be stuck this  way for awhile, I'd better make some  adjustments. Not too bad. The latex'll limit the amount of light  delivered to my optic nerves. Well, it gives you a face to talk to  at least, and we can all work in  normal light again. The testing's making me sick. You're physiology has changed and,  well, all bets are off. I can't believe I have to spend  another night here. Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet  up with that boyfriend of yours now. No. That's okay. It's just, being a  guinea pig is more work than I  thought. I'll be fine. Dr. Caine. What's up? Just stopped by to let you know, I'm  going out for a bit. Going out? Hey wait a sec! What do you mean going out for a bit? If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna  go crazy. But you're not supposed to leave the  compound. Why not? That's the rule. Yes, but I made that rule. It's my  rule and I'm changing it. You can't just change it. Carter, I was suppose to be like this  for three days. Three fucking days and  I'll be damned if I'm going to spend  the rest of my life as a prisoner in  this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going  out. I'll be back in a couple of  hours. Okay? Shit. Yeah, it's Carter. We got a problem. Yeah, well. You know how it in  sometimes. Thanks, but everything's cool. He could be anywhere. Hell he could be  right behind us. See you there. What a mess. Shit. Don't even think it... Once...just once. We're just saying we need to be  cautious. Look, this isn't a monkey we're  talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't  you think you're over reacting? Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out. Where the hell have you been? I got a little stir crazy, so I went  to my apartment to pick up some stuff. What are you talking about? Just what did you see in my apartment? It was bad enough you left without an  escort, but to take off the... out in public? Don't make a mountain out of molehill.  I didn't let anyone see me. Come on, Linda. You don't expect me to  be some kind of prisoner. I'm still Project Leader, Linda. It's  my decision to make. Matt? Sorry, man. You'd do the same if it  were the other way around. How much blood do you think you've  taken so far? Every day... feels like you're sucking  me dry. It's funny. All these years I've known  you, I never pegged you for a  megalomanic. The shoe being on the other foot. You  getting to run things. Don't patronize me. And for the record, you've got no idea  what it's like. I get up every morning  and you people stick needles in me.  You bombard me with radiation until I  vomit. And then at six it's over for  you. You get to go home. But Sebastian  is still here. Sebastian can't leave,  or else. That's the worst part, you  know. Here I have this ... this GIFT  and I can't even use it. You're goddamn right it's a gift. And  if you weren't so goddamned short  sighted, I'd be out there right now  trying to master it. Looks like I'm going nowhere. Come on, man. We've got a ton of tests  scheduled today. Do them yourself. No. Funny, huh? I've become a literal  metaphor. I know. And you being right doesn't  make it any easier for me. I'm not scared of being stuck this  way. With a little more make-up and  practice, I could... ... pass. Y'know, get by in the world.  But the testing... What if it's years? I don't know how  much more testing I can take. 60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ... We've got it. We've got it. 93% ... 95%... 95% Come on, baby. Come on. Full quantum cascade at 95%. I'm sorry. You're sorry? You're fucking sorry?  Six weeks of this shit and you're  sorry! Leave him alone. He just needs to blow  off some steam. Yeah? I'm going to the lab. Don't you sleep? Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept. Okay. I'm here if you need me. How'd it go? Quiet. He worked in the lab till about  10:30 and then went to sleep. Ah, my two favorite people. Good  morning. Why so cheery this morning? You know some days you just wake up  feeling the world is full of  potential. Like your eyes have been  opened. I'm happy if I make it to my coffee  machine. Cook up a batch and let's see where we  go. I trust you. Now if you'll excuse me,  I need to have my head examined. Think he knows about us. When you were a kid, you ever dream  about being invisible? Sure... all the time. What did you imagine you'd do? The usual. What's the usual? Hanging out in the girl's locker room.  Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass. Jimmy Margiani? School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am.  Back then, I was the size of a small  planet and made a rather large target. Ever think up anything along the grand  scale? Sure. World domination. Manipulating  stock markets, consolidating a  political power base. But those are  more recent fantasies. And what if it weren't fantasy? What  if you were out there in the world and  could do whatever you wanted with no  consequences whatsoever. How far would  go? I mean... if it were real? I don't know, man. Out in the real  world... I mean, there's a  responsibility... Let's say you saw a woman with amazing  tits. Would you brush against them? Hell, I try and do that now. Human nature. So if you could get away  with more, would you do more? I read that in a survey at a major  university they asked college students  "Would you steal if you were  guaranteed to get away with it?" 82%  said yes. Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder  if the world's ready for what we're  doing. So, Doc what did you do? What do you mean? When you were out. I just walked around. Y'know. Aw, you just walked around? Come on.  There's more, right? Like what? Man, I'd be walking up to people  saying shit like "This is God, go,get  a haircut." Or hanging out in the  changing room at Victoria's Secret. Kind of sophomoric, don't you think.  Besides, it was late and I wasn't out  that long. Well, did you see anybody? There was this one girl. Yeah? And did you mess with her? Naw... Well maybe a little. I tell you though, a man could get  used to it. Goodnight. Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you. I don't know. I don't see anything.  It's like something hit it. Hello? No. No. He's here No, I'm staring at  him. He's right there in his room. Relax... it's nothing. Where were we? Be quiet! And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is  it who blinds me?" and Odysseus  replied "Nobody is my name". And the  Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody  is killing me. Nobody". Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing. Nobody's gonna hurt you. I am now. No. Why? What of? How'd that happen? Sarah... You saying I had something to  do with it? I was in my room all night. That's all twelve hours. You saw the tape. The man was in his  chamber. Well, it wasn't me. And it wasn't him. Any big plans for tonight? Really? Whatever happened to that guy  your were seeing? Being locked down here, I'm forced to  live vicariously. Someday you'll have  to tell me what he's like. Au domain. Hmmm. What the hell? Pretty clever really. All it does is  recycle the signal. He flips this  switch, it takes a snapshot and that's  all we see. Dogs aren't people. Are we in any  danger? I'll call General Caster right now and  convene the oversight committee  tomorrow. What do we do in the meantime? Just sit tight and wait for my call. Just a little trouble at work. In a minute. I have to make a few  calls. Hello? Hello? Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP! What? No good morning for me? Don't  you like me anymore? That's okay. It's going to be busy  day. He's probably meeting with the  committee trying to figure out what to  do. What? Let me see that. Intercom's working, but there doesn't  seem to be an outside line. Authorization please. Authorization invalid. Request denied. Authorization please. Authorization invalid. Request denied. Let me try mine. Authorization please. Kensington Two Romeo One Five Nine. Authorization invalid. Request denied. How long before anybody starts looking  for us? Already in. It was only a second level  encryption. Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm  just extraordinary. But apparently someone is more  extraordinary than me. What is it? There's nothing wrong with the system.  Our codes have been removed. Removed? By who? Here's a clue. Only one code remains. Dr. Sebastian Caine. He's not in there. I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me  in. You have no idea what it's like. The  power of it. The freedom. I can't let  that go. There's nothing to talk about. See ...  I've done things that can't be undone. I'm here. Doctor Caine? This is bad. What happened? Intercom... the phone lines. They're  dead. What the fuck is going on here? What? Did you find him? What happened? I don't understand. Isn't it obvious? Right now, we're the  only ones who knows he exists. If he  gets rid of us, no one knows and he  becomes the most powerful man on  earth. But he's not a killer. Can you fix the elevator? Restore our  codes? It'd take hours to crack the  encryptions. Right now that sounds like good news. So what do we do until then. Sit  around waiting for him to kill us off? You sure this'll work. Systems hot. Activating motion  detectors. That's him. Got 'em. Just watch our backs. Hey Carter,  ready? Let's do it. If we split up, can we trap him on  corridor eight? Going Thermal. He probably just stopped moving. It's me. Do you have anything? Nothing. How did he get by us? He couldn't. Sebastian! We're here to help.  Sebastian. There. Behind those pipes. He's not  moving. Doctor Caine? Can you hear me? We see him. But he's not responding.  The heat signature doesn't move. C'mon... C'mon... Covered. What the... Just a vent. Just a goddamn vent Looks like... looks like we're pumping  out heat... No fucking shit! Sebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go. H...Help... MMmmphg Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!? Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from  a head wound. Shit. Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's  shutting me in. Where is he? Where? Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the  place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must  be ghosts. I'm starting to lose resolution on my  thermals. If the room temperature is the same as  his body temperature, thermal  visors'll be no good. Linda...it's not safe. But... Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo... Not even close. So... just out of curiosity, how long  has my best friend been fucking my ex- girlfriend. Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You  aren't thinking rationally. She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she? Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk  this through. It's not too late. C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm  your friend. I'm sorry, but I just feel that our  friendship is holding me back. I'm  sure you understand. He'll be okay. He's got to be okay. He was going to kill me. We've got to got out of here. Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he? Oh god. That's right between us and  the lab. Where are you going? But... Sarah, wait for the others Ahh!  Shit! Karl Three. Nice shot. It won't kill me unless it gets  infected. You? So he could be anywhere right now. What do we do? You missed. You. I've always liked your feistiness. Sarah! Sarah! Goddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you  let up... Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! I'm losing him. Did you see her? She went to the supply room. Carter  needed blood. She didn't listen. But... Her too? It happened alright. Now we have to  deal with it. Yeah? And just what are we supposed to  do now? Now? Now you die. Where? I would say that what I am  experiencing is psychological  awareness. I like you being in  complete and absolute control. You're never gonna bring me back  Linda. I never want to come back. Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time  for old times sake. Don't listen to him. It's not worth  it. Come on, Matt. Let's go get the  elevator back on-line so we can got  out of this hell hole. He does anything, anything at all,  come get us. I'll be back to check on  you in five. Imagine you two, carrying on right  under my nose. Out of curiosity, what  did he give you that I couldn't? Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If  that's what you want... Figured it out? You were always so  clever. Get out of here! The villagers with their torches? Lock  up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's  not gonna happen that way. See, I've spent all my time down here  thinking up this plan. When they find  you, they'll find a pile of charred  corpses. The result of a terrible  accident, I'm afraid. I guess because I don't have to look  at myself in the mirror anymore Remember that first night I was out? I  did something bad, just to see if I  could get away with it. And when I  did, I realized I could have it all. I  can kill in broad daylight. And  nobody's gonna tell the police they  were fucked by a ghost. Anything I  desire I can make happen, but not if  people know. I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs. He surprised us. We weren't  expecting... Lin... I can't feel anything. A little... What're you doing? Barely. There's no way out. They say freezing to death isn't so  bad. You just kinda pass out. Authorization please? Caine. One One One One One. Authorization valid. Thank you. You said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't  hold on to the past. Oh God! I'm gonna find everyone in your family  and kill them-. Your sister... she  never liked me. I think I'll go after  her and her little boy first.  I just wanted you to know that before  you die. Thought I'd... thought I'd save you  for a change. Let's got out of here. He said it himself... All they'll find  is a pile of charred corpses. In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out  the whole lab. Forget about me. You go. But... I can't. I'm going to pass out. Don't look. It's coming down! Sebastian, you fuck. No! Remember the day we met? You were  wearing a red dress and you were so  pretty. Now... Now look at you. Get off of her! Sebastian, stop it. You fucked it all up.
