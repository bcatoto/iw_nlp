Toni Blake from Langley P.D. We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate. It's Blake. How do you feel about Wisconsin? Yes. Come on, Carter. You know it's Michael. That's it? Charming. Only the real stiffs. The cemetery... It's Blake. Meet me at Grand View. Girl scouts. Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains... Broken blood vessels on her right forearm. Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect. That don't match either of the victim's. Right. So why don't we get on with this investigation? Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis. Her home office was ransacked. It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers. It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you? They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case. It's for your cigarette. I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D. The door was open, so we let ourselves in. Carter. Sweet dreams, Blake. What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone? Care to join me? I can be real stiff. You take all your dates here. Blake? Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten. Where? Carter. Impressive, Blake. Where'd you learn how to do that? As which point she drops to her knees in pain... The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker. No blood on the knife. Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell. One set of muddy shoe prints. I like a woman who takes control. Well, when you put it that way. With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers. Why am I here? No thanks, I'm not thirsty. Funny, we just drove right in. Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate. Carter. Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions? Mind if we sit down? I'll be damned.Doesn't look good. Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing. Pretty messy. Parents have already been notified. Our office has been trying to get a hold of you... It's Amy Kramer. Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown. We got a dead body in there.Would somebody shut this guy up? Who are you, the serial killer police? What difference does it make? What the fuck are you talking about?Yeah. Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight. Don't think so. But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere. Totally. I checked all the rooms and closets... Nothing to fear. The coast is clear. And miss the big game? No way. Checking out your place. No shit?! Oh. Sorry. I'm on my way to the ring and -- Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom? Yeah, me too, Keri. Oh, God... no... not Molly. What? Where is she? I'm not leaving without her. Where's Molly? She's not in her room... He found you, didn't he? I don't know. Why didn't you tell me? Any other psychotic relatives I should know about? Jason? Freddy Krueger? Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle? Now you're joking, right? You some kind of fugitive or something? I'm sorry, alright? It was just a stupid joke. Just forget it... Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends. Or what? You're gonna shoot me? I just went for a walk. It's no big deal. Nothing. You're twisted. To the bathroom. Can I do that alone or do you want to watch? My life is a living hell. Alright, I was wrong. There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster. The dorms are only fifty feet away. You could practically see into my window. So, what difference does it make? I promise not to run off to Cancun. Well, Dad thinks it's okay. Okay, you win. I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms? I'm sixteen, Keri. I should be able to live wherever I want. What the -- You're so predictable. Better? Here, take my jacket. You look kind of cold. You saw that Michael Meyers display. You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that. Well, I'm not going until I talk to you. Then you come out here. Can I come in? I came to see you. Nah, I didn't tell her where I went. Why not? I borrowed it. Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday. Shelve the barf bag. It's the key to the main gate.Another historical inaccuracy. It's not historically accurate, that's all. Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver. It was a butcher knife. Besides, it's historically inaccurate. Can't you hold it? What is it? You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms... Keri, you all right? Can't it wait till Monday? I thought maybe we could dance... I'm very light of my feet. Oh, right. Sorry. Do we have to invite him to the wedding? So you're really Michael Meyers' sister? Never. You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it. I can't believe this is happening. The serial killer? Who? You're right. It does sound strange. What? What are you looking at? Hey, you alright? A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice. Doesn't make it bad advice. The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free. This kid just wants his freedom. Still wants to move out? It's John, isn't it? You okay? You seem a little off. Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
