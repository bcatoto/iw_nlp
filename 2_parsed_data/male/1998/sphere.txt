Open it, Captain! Let me out, Captain. Open the door! Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain. Open it, please.Dr. Levine, please! Return to your seat! ... Your civil rights have been overridden! Please, Dr. Levine. Calm down, Dr. Levine. Fletcher! Now! Get out of there! Fletcher, get away from there... Fletcher, I want you back here. Fletcher? What are you doing out there? Pull it, damn it! Now! Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have. This thing is gonna crush us. Do you see it? It's either that or we grow gills. Increase positive pressure! He's right beneath us. Why can't I -- ? What the hell is going on here? Thirty yards. Sure. Each time it started fires inside the habitat. Forty yards. It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface. But we've never used it underwater before. We're a habitat. Not a castle. The only defense we have is High Voltage. Fifty yards and closing. A squid? The size of a whale? I don't think so. Target acquired. Sixty yards. Direction's east coming! Shut up, Beth. I don't want to hear it. You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you? Can't you tell us something. Nobody move! Nobody move. There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed. My procedures. And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely. Back at the door -- I asked you to back away. They told me about sixty hours. The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears. Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman? What are you -- his mother? Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go. Edmunds, the subs? Yeasts? Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread. Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before. What is it? I said back away. Back away then. Basic English? There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet. Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet. Pull it. You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner? Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions. What the hell? It shut us down. Going active. No. I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat. He might be listening now. Bullshit. What's out there isn't alien. It's an animal. You think he killed Edmunds? I don't want you talking to Jerry. If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened. Edmunds? Can you copy? Damn it, Edmunds? Edmunds? You don't think weapons are important? Great, okay. Ask him about his weapons. What am I -- a dog, now? He translated it wrong. "My name is Jerry"? It's like "See Spot run." -- without a cautionary word to anyone. You know, Ted said something to me earlier. I think he's right. He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy." -- and then brought her down here -- You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation -- So you knew this when you wrote your report? When was this? She should've known better. I think I do. How drastic? No "buts". If he wants to be left, we'll leave him. Hello? Yes, the subs -- I want a report... Hello... Yes, a report. Gimme... shit. I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say. He's here somewhere. Find him. The sub's on it's way. Go! C'mon! What do you mean, he's missing? Just worry about yourself. Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes. Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant. Don't get hysterical, Norman. Everything can be killed. You mean, what's in that thing is immortal? Like "Thou shall not kill"? What? I don't know. But it's something alien. What is it, Norman? It's a corrosive gas. On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile. At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic. Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile. They pressurize us with helium. Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson. We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail. The one you recommended. In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration. We think it might. That's why we brought you here. We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now. Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me. I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor. Extraordinary, isn't it? Maybe older -- -- dating the crash at least that old. Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year -- See this? Coral. Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick. As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago. Something like that. That doesn't surprise you? What? Survivors? No, I wouldn't think so. A thousand feet. A cyclone's on it's way in. I thought they would have told you on the phone. We're moving fast considering the storm. Well, we don't have all the facts yet. Good. Security's been our biggest worry. Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight. You talk to any reporters? Any press? Anything else? What have you been told so far? Come with me. The team's already waiting. Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson. You weren't my choice. The Pentagon made me take you. Captain. Edmunds, get in here. I need you for this. Norman, get out of there now! Norman? They've left, keep watching! Well, where the fuck is he? What the hell is going on here? Fuck him. What? Hello? Any sign of Harry? They're coming. Send them, damn it! I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible -- Get him out of there. I thought I told you people -- What caused it? Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up -- Thank you, I can see that. Try something else. Can you open that panel? She wired this system. Edmunds? Get in here. I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted. With an "o". Harold with an "o". I'm in charge. What? Not now, Beth. Please. I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking. Where's Edmunds? Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing. Ignorant. The thing's ignorant. How do you mean, strange? What's the message? We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it? Who is that? Where's that coming from? Gimme a report, I want -- Just tell me worst case. Worst case of what we might find? You don't know that. Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind. So? What's the problem? The what? So how do we get it open? A break for what? What? So do we. And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels. Yes, Harry. I did. I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped. It's chipped. I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts. The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb. The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented. To the craft? None. Not a scratch. In the dome hanger. All our tapes are transferred to the sub. It's on a 12 hour timer. If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes. Resetting the sub. Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood? It won't register. It's too big to image. The sensors are picking up something outside. Edmunds? It's not talking, it's mimicking. I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry. I want a name. A real name. This thing's full name, rank and serial number. From the sphere? Get out of there. I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood? Internal power. They switched us over. We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside! How can he be missing? Ted, shut up. Are you packed? Ready to go? I want everyone packed. Now! What? No, I know they're civilians... But what does it do? This... sphere. What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back? We had considered it. What do you make of this? Radiation shield, you think? What is it? Ted, get her away from the door. What about a crowbar? Duly noted, Ted. Edmunds, try using suction. Nobody goes inside, until we know what's inside. The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.In a minute, sir. If the subs aren't here yet, sir -- Sir! Sir, the door -- it's opening. Sir, if the subs haven't left by now... In the ship, sir. Yes, sir. Nothing, sir. Nothing, sir. I'm getting no sub reading, sir. Subs are still at surface, sir. Harry? Can you copy? Nothing. I don't know. Everything was normal. No changes at all. We don't have anything else to try, Sir. It's not sucking, sir. Working on it now, sir. Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this. No idea. We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater. Minutes ago. Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.I can't... I can't see... It's burning... They're warm. I can feel the heat on my legs. They're like pink snow, sir. Sticky.If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic. She's not gonna know. What -- you want me to retype it? He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge. She's not gonna know, sir. He understands me fine. It's not ignorant. I have to tell you. It's strange. ... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message. It's a single sequence repeated over and over. Please watch your closest monitor... Ladies and Gentlemen... Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe. Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set. There wouldn't be any place to plug it in. It could. But the odds of it being any use to us are against it. It's nonsense. There's enough difference between our own species to prove that. Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows. The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman. Ted seems to have some ideas. To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere. No. They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all. They have another purpose entirely. We know how this craft got here. Where it's been. Ted? Captain? Then how can it be chipped? I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash? Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped? Right. So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch? How much damage? Won't make any difference. The tapes document everything. They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them. Yes you are... You're staring at me. Why are you looking at me like that? Another attack? Just in time for what? In time for what? Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion. That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth. We never even had a conversation, Norman. I never said that. Cannibalism, to be extreme. And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible. A light switch. A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power. It's an American spacecraft. You'd have to ask them. For who? The fish? Pry the thing open? What are we -- neanderthals? You mean forget? We all kill ourselves? Bad joke. Sorry, Beth. No. I don't. But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing. How's that working out, by the way? It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there. Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it. Well, press something! You know how to work this thing? I'm trying. There. Her legs are in the way. Gimme a second -- C'mon, Norman! Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three -- Hurry, Norman. Four minutes. Missed. Push her, c'mon. I can't reach her. How far away's the sub? How much time you figure to get to the surface? We're never gonna make it. Fine. I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium. Did I kill her? Stop what? What are you -- ? What is it? Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag? The three of us. Don't have to. Watch. It'll do it for you. Navy transmission. They're sent from Wisconsin. Wisconsin's your answer. She's lying, Norman. Just like she lied about fixing your suit. I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there. Take a look for yourself. She's cracking, Norman. I thought she was with you. Her suit's gone. When I woke up, nobody was here. What happened to her? You're clear. You see the airlock? Norman, where are you? ... you there? Norman? I don't remember much. It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it. Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer. Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman. You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine. Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others. It's normal, really, isn't it? In a crisis. The stress. The panic. Did I? Don't do this. Don't psychoanalyze me. I hate squid. Period. Just like you hate jellyfish. There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute. What are they? I could never read that far. I never wanted to. What happens on page 87? Have you ever read page 87? Norman? You don't understand about the sphere. You were all supposed to leave. You weren't supposed to stay down here. What are you still doing here? It's like... What is that? That noise? Curious, isn't it? What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see. Then what, Norman? You mean, you think I'm cracking? Am I? Gimme another explanation. Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone. So, we know . We know it went through a black hole. We saw it. Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we? It'd go in some report like some big discovery. So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole. But they didn't . The called it an Unknown Entry Event. On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was. Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible. A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible. I'm completely serious. There is something very important missing from that spacecraft. You know what that is? And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures. What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional? So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it. Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human. If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding. Our present. This spacecraft was designed to pick things up. They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in. They come across this. This... sphere . Find it interesting, curious. They draw it inside to take back home. This answers one of our questions. Time travel. A black hole. Our answer. Nice work, Norman. C'mon, Norman. C'mon. Go ahead. Ladies first. You sound defensive. Don't be defensive. You holding up alright? How are you feeling, Norman? It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer. He'd run screaming "witchcraft". And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics. Good idea, Ted. "We are friends". Codes are for hiding information. So it's making a mistake. It's making a code without intending to. I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters... Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard. And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral. So I translated it... ... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code? If you're trying to communicate, why use a code? If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code. I'll work on it. Well, if it's a discharge -- Salt's good for you, Ted. Helps you from getting impotent. Look closely. That isn't writing. Those are grooves. Not where. When. 400 years ago. From our future. It didn't fly here. It arrived here. Meaning it didn't land in the water. We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal. Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper. But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere. Not even a scratch. It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain? That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it? Save your breath. It's not an alien spacecraft. Do you? All the facts you need are right in front of you. Think about it. Is it? A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it? Someone went to a lot of trouble. Try again. You don't think it does? I think it's rather obvious. That's right. Shutup, Ted. You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering. Easy Ted, we're not mining gold. You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman? Just one of Norman's many secrets. She told me what you said, Norman. Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down. Thinks it's a mistake. To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.What was that, sir? They're in the sub, sir. Waiting. The others, sir? They're topside. We're ready to take you home, sir. It's over, sir, The storm has cleared. Norman Johnson.I see it. Yes, sir. I'm here. Jerry? Please. Stop this. Jerry? Maybe so. But I think we need to ask Jerry about it. Yes, I do. Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier. But sir, I think it's imperative. I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related. At least our obituaries will be accurate. That's reassuring. What for? ... it raises a very serious question: What happens if Jerry gets mad ? Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional... I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response. That's smart. Let's talk about guns and violence. The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence. It's smart. It's approaching us in a simple way. Like you would a dog. Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you. -- I didn't know it would come to this -- Wait a second -- At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break. '81, I think. She tried again five years ago. I thought you should know. She put a razor to her wrists a day later. A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university. She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments. She was also living with him. Yeah, I know. And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement. You don't want to know. I'm not paranoid. I know Beth. She can be drastic. But sir -- You can't just leave Harry down here, sir. He's missing. He's gone. He left. Harry's missing. All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him. I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us. I don't know. That's the point. Or maybe, it can't be killed. If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all. Maybe we shouldn't. Picked up something? What is it? Take a look. What's wrong with oxygen? But sir, I don't understand. This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life. ULF report? Nobody's mentioned that in years. You mean someone actually read it? What team? It doesn't make any sense. It's impossible. -- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft? There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old. Hold on -- -- Wait a second -- Geologists? Not really, no. Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret... When did it crash? What is it? A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite? What do you need me for? Then why am I here? A thousand? An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors. How deep is he? They didn't tell me anything. Storm? What storm? From what? What's with all the security? Press? No, I haven't. Nothing else. The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really. What team? The Pentagon? I didn't know I had friends in Washington. Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it. Captain. Right, forgive me. Thank you, Colonel. Down below, Harry said we would all have to die. Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation. But sitting here, we still know. So how is that possible? Unless we make ourselves forget. Yes. And I think we already know it will. Beth -- Hear what? What? Let's get out of here, Beth. Let's go home. C'mon -- Beth -- gimme the gun. I -- I know. You're too strong, Beth. Beth? Stop it! Then where's it coming from? Beth, stop it! Where is it coming from, Beth? Beth! Don't fuck with me, Beth. Get away from the door, Beth. It's not safe for you to be either. Don't, Beth. Please. Beth -- I promise -- Don't, Beth. It's not me, Beth. I swear. It can't be. Shut up, Beth -- Beth, the message said Harry. "My name is Harry". My name isn't Harry. That's bullshit. Yes. I never went in that sphere. You're insane. You manifested that, Beth. That's when you went in the sphere. But -- You're lying -- Beth you're losing it. C'mon. Someone did. Then why, Beth? Why go in? Why put out explosives? Why manifest the snakes? He can't manifest. Against what? Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat. Why did you go in the sphere, Beth? Did you? Are you manifesting them? Do you fear them? What are they doing down here? In the bathroom? Suddenly appearing. You know what I mean. How do you feel about snakes? You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink. You think I'd really drink that? I'm feeling better. Your watch. The grooves around the door -- they've shifted. And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now. The sphere looks different. Where are you? Not believing you. I'm sorry. Thirty years ago. In residency. I passed out. You? You want to kill him? Beth -- Doesn't say. What? Wait -- isn't that dangerous? Three to six hours. "20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... " It's like a sleeping pill? What's that? P-a-r-a-s-o... Parasolutrine? Damn it! Chloramphenicol? Riordan? Bingo. Tarazine? Does it cause drowsiness? That's all we need. To get him unconscious -- put him under. Sintag. Valdomet. Ephedrine hydrochloride. Diphenyl parlene. Looks like some sort of code. Must be. And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control. No. I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences. You ever read the Bible? It talks about our sinful nature, you know? I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled. It's evil. It's inside us. It's what we are. He must not realize he is. Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then. He must've manifested his dream. It's his fear. The squid. He's manifesting his fears. Making them real. I don't know, Beth. I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can. When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87. How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to. Then you found the book, remember in your lab. Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid... I don't know. He acquired some sort of power. A power to manifest things. When did the messages start? The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere. Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name? But Harry never would? He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry. We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry. He translated it wrong. Created. Brought to life. I don't know. But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry". And -- After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion. But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him. "... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long. That would make a formidable monster." "Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids... Page 87. "I could never read that far." Page 87. I don't know, Beth. I wasn't there. This being after you so carefully fixed my suit. All I know is I opened that refridgerator -- You think? Did you look? It was on the top shelf. 1-800-Deepsea delivery. I hear they're good. We must've had it delivered then. It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any. The refridgerator. Fixing it. I think so, Beth. Yes. He what? Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me. What are you doing in the ship? Beth? Still clear? My air isn't... I'm coming back. You fixed this suit? Beth? I can't see anything. How does it look? Still clear? But I don't know how -- You fixed my suit? I would. But my suit -- In case you die, too? Why should I go? Four days? Wake him, then. Let's go. Get outta -- You, me and Harry? It's not worth the risk. Forget the sub. Where are you going in such a hurry? Beth -- Beth, I didn't. Hold it together. Alright? Don't do this. Beth -- What? It's done, alright? It's over! And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay? Calm down, Beth. Alright? You went through Edmunds' things? Where did you get this? You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up -- So what? C'mon, Beth. Don't make this personal. He told me himself they were taking us back. What are they? What could have done this? I can't feel her bones. She's like a sponge. Beth. Beth -- Beth. They are or they aren't. Which is it? Beth -- And you didn't tell anyone? You knew about the squid not being normal. Before Fletcher went out there? Wait a minute. What do you mean -- not normal? Me? Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived. Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here. Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid. Then jellyfish? Yeah, it was awful. ... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific. At my mother's beach house. We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him. No, thank you. I hate jellyfish. We have a library? Where'd this come from? Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think. Get this thing off me. 400 years ago? I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations. No. Go ahead. Really. Ladies first. Yeah. Drowning. What -- are you threatening me? The timing has never seemed quite right. It never occurred to me. We can't go down there. We're not prepared. That deep? That takes years of training, Beth. We're just scientists. Lab scietists. We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks. Underwater? Wait -- down where? C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind. I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone. Seriously. I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea -- It's bullshit. The report's a joke. That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about? Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret? Is it coming from our own computer? Where's it coming from? When did it come across? It would erase all our knowledge of it. All of our power. The power allows us to manifest our fears, right? What if we feared the power to go away? There is one possibility. Good. Thank you. Now that I have it on. Why are you laughing? You don't even know what that means. Nine hundred feet to surface. Wait! No idea. Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit. Harry? You got her? Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here! I'm trying to keep balance with -- Shut up and catch. I heard! I heard! Hold on. Are you trying, damn it? Just -- I'm trying. Shit. Here -- catch her. Hold on. Two and a half minutes. Once we're in the sub. Shut up and open the door. Help me lift her. I don't think so. It's the squid! Stop it! You know what it is, Harry. That's right. We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this. How do we decode it? Wisconsin? But why would she -- ? You didn't say that about the food? Beth left? She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me. What do you mean? She's not here? Thank you. My suit -- Beth said she fixed it -- I can't breathe... Am I... clear? Harry? You don't remember that? You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die. Have you looked outside? Jellyfish. Everywhere. I hate jellyfish. Harry, what happened in the cafeteria? Getting anywhere with those? These aren't half bad, Fletcher. You might have a second career coming. That far in what, Harry? Page 87 of what, Harry? What is it, Harry? Then explain it to me. Tell me about the door. Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry? You remember opening the door? Harry, can you tell me about the sphere? What noise? It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry? Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you. No. I didn't say that. Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight. I can't. If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong. I can't believe that, Harry. Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone. So what? I don't follow you. Not a clue. Don't be so optomistic, Harry. Good point. I don't know what you're talking about, but good point. I mentioned it in my report. Didn't you read the report? But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past. Which one? Let me get the list out. To what? Whatever I can do to help. Look, would you -- Wait a second, I -- No, why don't -- I'm fine. I'm not being defensive. Fine. I'm fine. What? About the time paradox. How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier... Beth and Harry? How are the others? The ships? Does this mean what I think it means? Told me what? What report? Really? Captain who? No, they didn't say -- Just that. Careful, it's heavy. What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash? Geologists? At a plane crash? Who's everyone? Know what? What report? What report? You've heard of me? I'm in psychology. Was. Still am really, just been a while. I treat aircrash survivors. Of course he did. He's been isloated for 400 years. He wants someone to talk to. Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic. We're talking about 400 years here. An alien that shows emotional responses. I think we need to address him, before he reacts further. I'm not sure. Has Harry spoken with Jerry? What was it? Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect. When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him. Well, he's polite. Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with? The creature? This is like nursery school. Please, Ted. I don't see anything. You mean a picture? Like what? Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted. You want me to try? He wasn't feeling well. I don't know. What? Keep watching the news. Are you watching the news? Four. Four years -- Don't be so supportive, honey. He didn't say much at all. Honey -- You seen my suitcase?You mean they haven't told you yet? By the way sir, I've read your report. I think it's brilliant. Barnes. He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived. Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir. This way, sir. No other equipment? Scientific instruments? Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?Strange, isn't it? In the middle of the ocean no less. Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it. Must be another Johnson then. Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight. You mean you don't know? Huh? Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote. Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.What sub? What was Edmunds doing outside? Too big? What? What is that? Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here. Give him a chance. He's speaking our language, not the other way around. Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions -- What's inside the sphere. She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that. To what? Sir, about leaving -- Did you hear me, sir, because -- Can I stay, sir? I'm willing to risk it. I am. After what we just witnessed. Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know? See this red here. Maybe we didn't want to come back. Time travel. I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer. Considered what? That it's American? How would you think it's American? What's wrong? A foot and a half thick? That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation. Some sort of lead or something. Look at this. What are you going to do -- shoot her? What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open. I'd also like it noted -- Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television. A half a mile long? He doesn't wait for an answer. By the bunks. Well, what's your theory? It doesn't make any sense. Well, they're not mine. No. I don't think so. Pussy. Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman. Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition. It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit. Thank you. What'd you say? See? No code. What'd I say? Yeah, I'll work on it, too. It's not a discharge. Right, Edmunds? You said before, right? So it's gotta be a message. Impotent? I'm not impotent. Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here. Looks like a design, some writing, maybe. Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message. Arrived? From where? Please. It must have flown here -- Meaning? An American spacecraft? Half a mile long? And buried 400 years? Yeah, good theory, Harry. If it is an alien spacecraft -- Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it. Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable. Why would this ship carry instructions in English? But it's impossible. Is it some sort of joke? Like one of those hoaxes? English? Alot like. You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't... Gimme some room here, will you? Back off. Gimme some space. It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you? What is it, Harry? What does Norman already know? What'd you say to him? Jerry isn't hostile, Norman. He said earlier -- we were his friends -- You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds? With what's out there? Not that I know of. Why? Barnes didn't know. Couldn't get a reading. Why's that? You want to put him on your couch, Norman. Grill him about his childhood? Unless it's an act. Sure, why not. Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch. You heard him, Norman. All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit. And "impotent". Where does he get off saying I'm impotent? He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick. Inside the sphere. Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms. There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know? Don't you see it? It's a picture of the creature. Try this one. Squint harder. Take a look. I rearranged the numbers. Put 'em up to the light. Go ahead. Squint at it. It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation. He's manic, Norman. You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me? Totally misplaced. He's overlooking things. Obvious things. Still, make a note I recognized that. Strange, isn't it? You know -- how it would have a button. You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do? He's a pussy.
