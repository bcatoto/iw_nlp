Seven-fifty. I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business. How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty. How about five hundred. That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition. What kind of deal you looking to?How's that football story corning along? A bit unexpected, wasn't it? And your lady? Good night? Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work. I get it. Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we... Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid. Who was he? She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend. Looking forward! Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here... It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business. Bring a friend. I've plenty of room. My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book. Take care. Right. Look, I must get back to Habib. I thought it was you. It's the hair! We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds? All right. As what? Hi-ya... I'll call you back. Now then... Did she? You were pretty thick at one time. What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?A couple I know are getting married. Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt. I don't know anything about it. What are you talking about? Ouch. Not like Matt, you mean. The Indian rope-trick. I despise the job. You called the casino a cesspit. I can imagine. Why did you quit? I hate cheats. It's the tension. Goodnight. Maybe another time. No. Thanks. Is it that bad? Jack Manfred. Eight-fifty. Is that your idea of arithmetic? What?! How about fifteen hundred? What's the Blue Book price? You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business. Not entirely. She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you. Not particularly. Get what? Are you accusing me of cheating? Last hand. It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble. I don't gamble. She. I found her in bed with someone. South African women are very sporty. I'll try and make it. Habib? I'm working on that soccer story. I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you? I want a job, Giles. We all played the field. She went back to South Africa. Three years, two months. March '93. I want to buy a car. I hate public transport. Leave me alone, Marion. Then what? Marion! What did you tell the police? There was a message, wasn't there? How did you know I was here? Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds. Gambling's not about money. Never. Why do you ask? Not talking. Writing. What? Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit! I'll leave the casino soon. I promise. You're entitled to your opinion. That girl, she works at the casino -- It will. It's beautiful. Thank you. Leave it. Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative. It's the truth. Marion. It's a book. -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it. He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner. Why not? I'm on at nine. What about a drink on the way home? You're my conscience. Marion, stop this. Do you have to swear all the time? Probably. I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective. Don't play the cop with me, Marion. I'll see you in my dreams. It's only hair. I haven't changed. Tension. It'll go. Fine. I don't know. Are you trying to read my palm? There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious. I start Monday week. I had training. In the Republic. It came my way. 450 a week. In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer. I've got a job. I've got something to tell you. Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it. I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another. I. sold the car. Turn around. You really are a beautiful woman. You want me drunk? You mean I won't resist them. I won't. Goodbye, dad. Yes, I know that. So how are you doing, dad? All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him. It's not that. No. Great. Did you solve your problems? How are you? Jani! Where are you? Hello... I don't think we should meet again. No thank you. And your hand too. I've still got mine. That bruise has cleared up nicely. Yes. It's all relative. I need the money too. It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place. Yes. What for? Did they tell you to sleep with me? How much do you owe? Wait a minute... I can't do it, Jani. What about my neck? Reynolds? You've done your research. What ten thousand pounds? But if it does. What'll you do when it all goes wrong? And I thought you were only after my body. You're serious. Robbery's not criminal? And I thought you were a bright woman. Forget it, Jani. It'll never work. Who's they? I don't have any money. switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed. Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you. What kind of trouble? Then you're not a pro. It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it. You choose. Remember the guy who cheated at the table? I'll watch. Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room. Turn left ahead. How did you hurt your hand? I don't gamble. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology. We all came from Africa, supposedly. And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft. The debts. Your father? In the casino. I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast. First visit to London? So why did you come to my casino? There's a casino in this hotel. Impossible to calculate. It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters. Oh hello. I've lived there. I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa. I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat. Of course I recognised him! Who did it? Tell me! Who... Turn left at the lights. Nice car. How much did you pay for it? Are you going to put a spell on me? And what do you do, Lucy? Have I? I'd like to buy you a drink. What happened to Bella? Rough day? Don't worry. "The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway. I'm off. I need to sleep. I don't gamble. No thanks. Does Bella come here? Vodka. Straight. On the rocks. And the girls? Who are these guys? You're talking about complicity. Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that. If I see you do it again, I'll report it. I'm not going to report it. That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s. Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating. Some other time. No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours. You've done pretty well. How long have you worked at the casino? Nice car. Thanks. Over the river. Wait a minute. You got yourself barred. I'm afraid that's not so, sir. You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet. I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet. Bruised. A pleasure. Pity about Bella. He's paying out in stacks of 25. Does he win? All right, Mr Reynolds. I just want the job. Fine. Fine. Very impressive. No. Yes. How? Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it? We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check. I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds. I don't gamble. What for? You want me to check? It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right. Five. Five. What happens if I want to sneeze? I don't think so. Where's the magnet? You use two alternating, don't you? 25 pounds or 25 pence in fours. Stacks of 20. Rows of 5. Why four? And not three or five? I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond. Do you have a Salon Prive? I was at Beadles. No. Has he? Jack.Don't let yourself down. Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good. I love you Jacko, you know that For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break. Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice... Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier. Found a job?It was you, you shit. You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm. I put them on together. What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight. Hey, you haven't changed your clothes! What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her. I'll tell you later. Rough life, Jack. I can't give you a lift back tonight. Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you. Don't worry, I won't report you! Hey Jack, join us. That bitch? No. Good call. Help yourself. Just girls. What are you drinking? Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers. I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat. So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money. I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy. I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you? What are you, a cop? I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong. What the fuck are you talking about? I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that. I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax. Not bad. I have other interests, of course. Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months. She's my baby. So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high. I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like. Have you got transport? Where do you live, Jack?Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here... How do you feel, Jack? She was a real asset. But what could I do? Thanks for the information. I can see. He's a good customer. Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella. Why don't you take a break, Jack. Jack, you're not the usual type we get here. That hair will have to go. You can start Monday week. We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something. This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again. She's not in the gaming business is she? Girlfriend? First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again. There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you? We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished. This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does. Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden. Ever? For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters. Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture. I said good call. Good call. What makes you so sure? I make it six. How many aces are left? You won't. Not without permission. Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched. Wipe your hands. Haven't you forgotten something? They've been tested. We do. Give me 365. Any exceptions? It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips. We check every four days. We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company. There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us. I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose. Where did you go to school? In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa. You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you? You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he? David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.You did? Ross. Detective Inspector Ross.
