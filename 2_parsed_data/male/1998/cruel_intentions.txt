I know. I know. What do you want me to say? That I'm supposed to feel remorse because I act the way I do? The truth is I don't. Look, I'm not like all the other kids in high school. I don't care about book reports and extra-credit. Teachers are idiots anyway. The only challenge out there for me is women. You see a girl you like. You pursue them. You conquer. You move on. It's exciting. I do. Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true. Same time next week? Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer. Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help. He was a coke addict, you know. It works a little. You do? Well, you don't have to get nasty about it. Yummy. Really? Care to make a wager on that? What, nervous I'm going to win? You can't park there. My, what an adorable shirt you're wearing. How are things down under? Blossoming I hope. Outstanding. I'm what you would call a fifth year senior. It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself. Ciao. Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house? Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual? It was fine. I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid Manhattan Debutantes. Nothing shocks them anymore. I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my touch. What? Swallow? You don't mean? So that's what this is all about. We'll get together and plan your curriculum. Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court? I see your point... though why should I care? Sounds intriguing. I can't. Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold. That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius. Shut up and turn to page 64. Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue. It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory. Care to make a wager on that? Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art. Could you be more desperate to read it? What are the terms? And if I win? Be more specific. What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car. No way, that car means everything to me. Even there? Pull! Die motherfucker! Shit, shit, shit. Kitty. Kitty. Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss. They're coming back next week. I write them everyday. I guess that makes two of us. Welcome. Why don't you head in and whip us up some of that ice tea of yours? We'll take care of the horses. We will. So what year are you going into? Got a boyfriend back home? Why not? You a lesbo? Nice. I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry. I read your teen beat manifesto. I must say I found it rather appalling. Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced? Oh really? How do you know I've been with several women? Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip. Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me? Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends. Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me. Sebastian Valmont. So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since you've never had sex do you touch yourself? What did I say? Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath. You're concentrating too much on your bowing. Let it flow. Here, let me help you. Now close your eyes and let's try again. Pleased to meet you. It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King. I guess our hour's up. Same time tomorrow? Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense - - none taken - - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me. Any ideas who it could be? Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now. Where did you say she's from? Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas? Greg McConnell. The football stud? He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat. It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year. I don't think that bothered him. What do you mean? Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field. Are you shitting me? I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know - "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything." It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover. Too bad he's in Kansas this summer. Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up. Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf? Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight. Outstanding. Don't think it's not going to cost you. No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended? You talking to me? What'cha reading? Great book. Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature. That's a matter of opinion. Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it. Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool. Please. Thank you. I'm working on it. Blow me. Okay. What? Another letter from your friend? You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her? Give me the fucking letter. Why did you do that? Is that the last thing you need? My your clever. Refreshing. You're right you know. About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person. You implied it. No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit. Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you. You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend. I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out. Why not? Do you deny that there's an attraction between us? You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles. Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that. It's my house. What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before? Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic. Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail Mary's for you. Good night. Baby? Right on time. Oh God... Oh God, I'm gonna cum. I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna... Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit. Jesus! Greg, is that you under the covers? Get out of here. Whoa! I told you to lock the door. I thought I did. Look Valmont. This was the first time I've ever done something like this. I was -- -- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah. Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career. Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer. Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes but not a fudge packer. Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything. Let's just forget the whole thing. Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you there. It's too good to pass up. After all, it is you who's bad- mouthing me to Annette Harrison. Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about. Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you. I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you. I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter. Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me. However, this whole incident's kind of turned me on. You get my point. Jesus Christ, I was only kidding. What do you think, I'm gay? My God, haven't you had enough for tonight. Our boy just can't get enough dick. You sick son of a bitch. I'll leave you guys alone. Score one for the team, Greg. Come to think of it, there is something you can do for me. Need a lift? How are you today? Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology. I said I was sorry. Have a nice sleep last night? I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night. Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me. I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away. Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you. Don't you believe in love at first sight? Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning? Who? How about tonight? Doing what? Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind. Yes. Without question. What? I'll leave this afternoon. Happy? He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before. That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth. What's wrong? Is there a mutual feeling between you two? Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit. Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded. From who? Annette, how long have we known each other? Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen? On my mother's life. That nosey bitch. Are you sure? Positive. Did you do everything I asked you to? Yes. You told her I never said I love you before? Yes! You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded? Yes! And you think she bought it? I'm pretty sure she did. Pretty sure or sure sure? She bought it. I'll be in touch. You would not believe what-- You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me. I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter? Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat. Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that. What's your plan of attack? But who will they turn to for help? I'm at your service. Oh sis. You're so tense. I hate it too. Oh baby, your soaking. Moving along quite well. Any day now. Goodbye Mister Bond. Hi, it's Sebastian. I didn't wake you did I? Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing. How was your date? Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go. Okay? Reading. Of Human Bondage. Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation. No. I'm through with my childish games when it comes to you. Hold on, that's my other line. Rub. Annette that's my mom calling. Can I call you tomorrow? I will. Shut up, Gretchen. You don't even know what it is. Do you know what it's about? Books are for fags. I weep for the future. Excuse me. Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something. Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park. First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines. I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening. Took me off the streets? Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings. You're a lucky guy. She really loves me. What do I do? But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address. Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter. How will I get to her? We'll make sure she gets it. Why are you being so good to me? Who are you calling? Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause. Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that. You amaze me. Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me very carefully. I have a letter from Ronald that he asked me to give to you. Now I can't exactly bring it to your house, since your mother despises me so here's what we're going to do. Excellent. He'll love it. Just taking your photo. Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off. I'm sorry that was out of line. I was just kidding. Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up. Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't  know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway. Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss. Of course. I'm not a monster. I swear. You promised to let me kiss you. I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there. Afternoon ladies. I wasn't planning on it, but being such a lovely day, why waste it in the city. Anyone for tennis? What's wrong with her? Would you excuse me for a minute? I hope she's alright. Alone again. What are you up to today? Need any company? I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive. Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa. Yes, you already did. Right after we played backgammon. Uh huh. You beat me three times. Yep. Then I fucked your daughter. I said, do you want some water? Come in. It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week? What? I do. I don't. I did. We played three games of backgammon and... Alright. I was bored out of my fucking mind. I hate doing charity. Yes it does. I can't win with you. I do not. I am lighten. Can we drop this? What are you doing? Stop it, it's distracting. Cut it out. No. Stop that. Yippy. Take a look for yourself. Yeah. Shut up. Nothing. If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her. She made me laugh. I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected. Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do. Am I bothering you? Don't tell me you finished The Fountainhead already? Great book. What's the guy's name, Florentino... My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino. You don't know Monsieur Philipe? Bonjour mademoiselle. You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you. Oooo, that felt good. That felt good too. I will kiss you all over. I'm sorry about that. You know what? I don't take it back. Because I'm in love with you. I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me! Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus. Why can't we be together? Yes. Shit. Some other time, Cecile. What am I, an idiot? For the first time, yes. It'll pass. Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done. You think? No, you were fine. I'm getting out of here. I just came to say goodbye. Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here. Good for you. Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites. Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite. Have a nice life. Get off me. I'm sorry, I can't. Shit. Get it together you pussy. Morning. With who? If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no. Exactly the opposite. I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it. A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified. Where is she? Where'd she go? We'll see about that. Hello. Is she with you? Who is this? Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you? No. Where is she?! I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone. McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is. I told you I don't know. One. Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central. Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line. Motherfucker. Ooops. Fuck this. Suave. Hi. You alright? It was perfect. You work way to hard. Here. Take the day off. Merry Christmas. Bad time? Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in. Who is our little friend so inexperienced that you have to resort to the alphabet game? Well, well, well. It's not what it seems like. Say hi to Cecile. I am. Oh yes. It was... Fantastic. I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card. It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part. Mock, mock, mock. Some other time. I'm not in the mood. It clearly is why. And I don't. I'll pick you up in an hour. I love you too. No, I'm not. What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way? Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest. Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you. I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet. That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it. I've never done this before. Screening calls. Any suggestions? Hi. Is Annette at home? Hi. Sure. This isn't working out for me anymore. It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up. Why aren't you understanding? I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up. I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed. Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea would appreciate you acting like a total psychopath. You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive. What, your virginity? Well that's over now. Sorry. I'm completely fucked up. I have a flair for drama. You wanted an answer to your question. Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again. I thought we should celebrate. Ronald? From Ronald. I haven't had a chance to read it, but I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me. Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera." You see, I expected your sort of bullshit so I took the liberty of phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now they're having a little get together in my love shack at the Grand Central Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile over you, but I promised him I would see you through your crisis. Thank you. Now, where were we? Oh yeah, the celebration. What shall we toast to? Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette. What's so funny? Come again? In any event, you still owe me my reward. Calm down. Will you calm down? I'm very sorry about that. I apologize. Get out? We had an arrangement. I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy. I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed. Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three. War it is. It's desperate that I talk to her. Well please leave a message that I called. Shit. I need to talk to Annette. Do you know where she is? Do you know when she'll be back? Annette! Annette! Fine. Could you please see that she gets this. It's really important. Hello. Yeah? Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay? What's wrong? What do you mean? I'll be right there. And this happened before you and I hooked up? Racist piece of shit. He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in. Don't worry about it. I'll stay. What time is it? Eight o'clock. You got to go. Did she show up? Nope. Do you mind if I check upstairs? I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day. I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here. Don't worry about it. Son of a bitch. Sebastian! Hey Ronald. It seems that you and I have some talking to do. Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and - What's your problem? Where the hell do you come off hitting women? What are you talking about? Kathryn. Did you hit her? Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too? Did you hit her? Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about. Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile. It's true, isn't it? Ronald, I'm sorry. You bastard! I trusted you! I trusted you! Fuck you. Why don't you give me a chance to explain. Don't you get it? We were all part of her game. I'm gonna let you up, but you have to give me a chance to explain. Understood? Annette! I'm okay. I'm okay. Holy shit. You're gonna be fine. I'm sorry. It's alright. I'm okay. Everything's good.
