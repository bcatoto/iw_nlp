You want to come inside? Is there something else I can do for you? That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City. We do not allow his kind on this block. You don't have to worry. She's going to be fine. We're law-abiding citizens just like you. Who told you we deal drugs? We like to think so, yeah. Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome. What happened? Did you lose your keys? I just need to use the phone, lady.Thirty is base price. Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up. Forty-five all total. Yeah. Not far. You will be fine. It's still day. This is one-way street. You go down the block to the middle. Nah, not dangerous. Not that dangerous. Not during the day. Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole. Moscow. Yeah. ... Oh ... So, you come here all by yourself? And where is she? What do you think? I left it on the curb? Where to?
