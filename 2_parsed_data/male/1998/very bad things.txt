We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car. That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person! Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident... Don't touch her. Call 911. I need a drink. Excellent. I didn't hear you. What did you say? What? Go home! Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck. You fucking bastard! If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry. And you're a little fucking reject. Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us. What are you fucking talking about? The hell I don't. I have plenty of friends. Don't point at me. What did you say? This is pathetic. It's sacrilegious. Why?! Why was the floor wet? Playing? She's dead. Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway... I don't have to... Multiple reasons. You're an asshole. No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me. It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak. Sorry Fish. No first of all. I'm not in a game mood. We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then. No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all. I got children. I've got a life. I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out. I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work. I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in! I don't give a damn. They're on me. They're smoking me out! At the seven-eleven. I can't do this. Fuck you Boyd! Don't talk to me about character. Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure! You got us into this mess. Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down! We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first. I am not flexible on this. Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs. That is absolutely not true. No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them. According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace. No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases. We can't do this. Wait. Wait a minute. I'm not wrecking the transmission! Have you ever done this before? What about the blood? You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony? So I didn't fucking do it! Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem. Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone? You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman. Sure, why not. I'm calling the police. Just stop. Stop it! That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here. We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police. You're a lying deviant. What did you do?! Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating. We have to call the ambulance. Calling the ambulance. I'm calling the ambulance. What are you talking about? What? She's got no fucking pulse. Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life. You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries. Don't even start. I'm not getting a ticket. There is no candy! Later. What? They're driving me nuts! Where's the bathroom? I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack... Have you thought about what I said? We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves. You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent. I want you to hear me out. It has to be done. Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911. Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little... If anything ever happens to me... I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather... Don't eyeball your kids. Don't ever stare him down. Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here? Are you solid with that? No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said... Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake. They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin... That's one idea. I know you'll be. Three hours.So. When is the wedding. And a house. Valued at 350 thousand. Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void. Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand. Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy. There's more.All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right? They won't figure it out. It has worked. Adam! Calm down. You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here. Nobody's smoking anybody out. Who? What are you talking about? What? What is your problem? Any time fat boy! Watch the tone fella. Lighten up Adam. Show some character. Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head. What does that mean? Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less. Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud. Alright. Let's do it. We have to get going. Well what the fuck are we supposed to do? She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia. So that's what we're doing. How do you figure? We've already done this. What? Sun rises at 5:52. The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this. Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works. We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear. Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done. She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down. Her fucking head was caved in. It's a marble floor, we can clean it up. Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows. We can do this. We can get her out of here. Bury her out in the desert. What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal... Just giving the facts. There's more. Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options. Call the police. Okay, that's one option. Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here. Are you sure this was an accident? Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead? Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME! Why? Why? Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance? Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing? What do you think you are doing? What are you doing? Wait! You don't know what you're doing. More. I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I? Prison Communications. One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars. You want to hear me out? Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change. Lois please. He's upset about Adam. We're all upset. Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing... Nothing happened in Vegas. I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from... What are you talking about? She's in there! Great. Fine. Perfect. That's right. She's in the bathroom...she's still working. That's right. Yup. Who? She's here. She's just...Hold on a second. She's not here. What? What is it? He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go. You guys stay here. Give me two more. What is her disposition? I'm not talking to you? The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives. I got her arm. We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground. Where do you look? What side of the neck? Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard... But not tonight. Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir. That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big. Fish? I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark! And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money! Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive. I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money. Whatever you say Kojak. Okay fine. You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation? My what? This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most. Hold on a sec. Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning? That's right. That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth. Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal. I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there? Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation. You got a nasty side to your thought process. And what does that mean? Are you insane?! You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you? Take care of business. Just do it. After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep. Suck my ass. Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police? You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes. Exactly! Exactly my point. What you just said. Say it again. Say it again. Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done? What is the question you asked me? What did you ask me? He is not cracking up. No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity? Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior. OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here. The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left... Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey. However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right? No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you... ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker. Go ahead. What kind of words? That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves. So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them. Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that? All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan. Nobody knows she's here. What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane. Nobody knows. Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens? They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal... Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose... Shut up. Shut up. No. She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party. Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English... That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars. Prison Communication Systems. An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir. Who's up for making some real money? Well, I didn't mean it. Come on tough guy. Listen to me. You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me? Okay Micheal, let's go. Upsy daisy big guy. Give me the Valium. Stop. Stop it! Micheal get a grip. What did you tell her? We're not goosed. Easy Micheal. You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want? The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know? This is going to stop right now. Right now! No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel. Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all. Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders. A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me? That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right? The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction. Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico. Take Mexico. There's my point exactly. Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right? I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot. Then what do they have? If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see? New king. I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night. Not true. False. I don't hate women. Oh really? Starbucks? Moore? I never heard that. The hell I did! The hell I did! You're a fucking moron.I got you. Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please? I don't think so. What. No way. What happened? Oh my God... I know... I know and I'm honored... I won't do it. The bucks gonna stop right here. If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down. No. I think it's fucked. Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father. Real times. No...we want padded chairs...okay? We'll be ready Adam. You need help. Not a prayer. You're sick. I'm serious. Fine? Fine what? I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things! You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly. I'm getting really tired of your bullshit. Isn't it a little late? Now? Hear what? Yeah. What does that mean? I don't know... What does that mean? What are you going to do? I don't think that's such a good idea. Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him. No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right. Regarding what? What's your point? I just want to get married. What? I don't know! I just want to get married. I said, what have we done? What? Boyd...What have we done? He's cracked up. Easy Boyd. He's having a problem here. Shut up Boyd. No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking... You always were a jealous man. It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives." Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this. I'm talking about prayer. I think we should say some words over the grave. I'm calling the police. Good God...Good God... Oh God. This is insane. Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here. Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys! Call 911. She's dead. Call somebody! Oh, Jesus...call the police. I can't. We need padded chairs. No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay. Not really. Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs... Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold. You said that Boyd. I do. What? Are we supposed to? Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there. But... No... What? I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of... ...I just love you so much...So much... Move the bodies? So what do we do? I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried. Like if something happened to him, he could still get us. He kept saying he was protected. What money? But... But... She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all... She's in the desert. She's out in the desert. It's too late. Micheal, by accident. No Micheal did. It was an accident. The prostitute. Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident. Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We... Do you love me? Do you love me? Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off. No it's not okay. It's not. Yes. That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids. Okay. Okay. Don't we already have someone to do that for us? No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back. I know. Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset. Can we just talk this out? Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying. No baby. We'll all be right in. Everything's OK. Just some more preparations. Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business. Yeah. Sure. Yeah baby. Everything's great. This is our honeymoon. "Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me. I'm working on it. No. No. I'll see you in about four hours. I left a message. I think it's going to be okay. What! Okay. No. Just like an hour or so. We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late. Hey. It's me. I'll see you tomorrow... I'm mad at you. Nesting? What are you doing? Well I do. I'm working on it, I've made three calls. I can't stop thinking about how much I love you. Not yet. Hi. I love you. Of course. I will. We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off. More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever. I'll call them from the road. We're leaving in three hours. Honey I don't have the time... Go down where? So what do we do? What kind of seats can we have? I'm not. What's the problem? Okay. Problems? With all my heart. Of course. You will not be common!!! I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body. That's absurd. Time out. You expect more what? He's a great chef. He just doesn't talk a lot. He's quiet. I've known him since Cub Scouts. What does Moore have to do with your growing? You don't like Moore? Since when? Who else? I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth. What are you talking about? He's my friend. He's not a moron. He is. It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding. How do you figure? They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it. I wouldn't know. Are we going to do this again? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else. Stop it. I'm sorry. What? Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's. How could I know what else I forgot? I'm not playing around. I forgot. I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry. Why what? I think so. I think I forgot the tent. Yes. Yup. Sent it. Sent it. I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are. I think so. I'm not sure. I don't think so. We missed the deadline. Government cutbacks. OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on. Yeah, Dad. It's great. I love you dad. Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle." You never walked away dad. You could have walked away. You did all right dad. What is it? I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit. I think so. The wahoo moment? The wahoo? Have another drink. I don't hear it. Buzzing? Where did you get that? Dear God...I don't know how to pray. I'm getting married... Go for it. He's your brother. Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes. I'm not breathing right. I just want her to be happy. About what? What does that mean? I don't know. She's really been stressing out. Yup. I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother. That's a good one. Yeah? There. That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never. I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn." Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me? Did he try to kiss you? My God... Downstairs in the closet. Greenpeace? A move? Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me. I have no idea. I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter. The first day. I got to agree with that. No...No. Yup.These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part? The rings? May we have the rings please? It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't. All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything? Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part? Oh I know that. How does it go... What song? Okay great. What will that be? We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?You go home! Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you. You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife. You're a loser. Eat my ass! About anybody but yourself. You never have. They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd. You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems. The hell you do. You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends. You're not a team player. You're pathetic. Why? I don't know why the floor was wet! The floor was wet. She slipped! We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head. I was just playing...we were playing just playing around. Franco mother-fucking Harris! Name one. Oh, and why am I an asshole? You're an asshole Adam. Boyd brought up divorce statistics. Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed? You're interrupting a personal conversation. First of all... I love you. How about my Fatburger? Goosed! Goosed! We're goosed! Goosed by God! We're goosed. He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out. Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America. Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime. Ball park sausages. You will not screw this up. You said nobody would miss her. Not really, no. They need leadership. What? What? What's your point? The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies. What's your point? They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something. Israel doesn't have a King. And what happens when you can't? You have a King fantasy. True. You hate women. Your ideas never work out. Nope. You said one in two marriages end in divorce. The hell you didn't! It's my fucking opinion. Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right. If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just... No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois. I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it? You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things. That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me? The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me? Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo". Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem. Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull. Do you hear buzzing Fish? At the newsstand on 3rd. Just go ahead and say what's on your mind. I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry... Come on. I'll take a ride. So? I don't care for him. You're not breathing right? Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button... Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes... Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343. Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body. Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9. I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards. It means she's insecure. Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters. That's just insecurity. I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here? You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect. I KILLED MY BROTHER! Right. Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man. Desert. It was an accident! Drum banging real times.Can't do what? I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore. They'll get us on accesory to murder. Jesus. She's fucking hot! The stripper's here. He's too drunk. He just had two. What's goosed? What's your fucking point? Today is the best day of the rest of our lives. Here's his head. He's right. Left side. Keith Richards, Dean Martin... Not tonight. I don't think so Boyd. Your investment ideas never work out. No I don't. Well that ought to be about the end of that. That's what I'm thinking. I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think? I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing. Where? Pup corn? I guess. You alright? All week long. He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror. He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his. Where's Boyd? Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim... Greenpeace. I'm thinking about maybe making a move. You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious. Did she believe you? What? Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head. How do you know she's dead. That ought to be about the end of that. I don't think that's a good idea. Shut up Micheal. That's right. Fucking desert. She's dead. Good times.Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here. Everything okay? I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey. And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out. You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead! Just kills me... I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me. I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am. I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing. I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...I'm just gonna let her know I'm here. Is everything okay? Sweet deal. She's still working? Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day. Where's Tina? Doing the bachelor party thing? The groom? So who's the lucky guy? Okay. Hi. Where is she? I'm with Tina. Is she there? Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?Well that's what I said. I said how's it going? What's that? How ya doing?
