Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee. Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick. S'matter with you? You look like you're fading. You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano. Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?No harm, no foul? This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking? Well, uh, can you tell us his name? So you admit it?Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch! ...Not until I get a little something to remember you by. Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong. I'm not leaving... All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then. Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes. That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help. Uh-huh. I was worried about you. Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted? If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest. Dom Wooganowski. Duh. You stole her from me. Now I want her back. People get hurt that way. You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels! The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that. Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will. Why's that? Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous? You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates. You know, clean the pipes. Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go. Mints? Car clean? Plenty of gas? Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine? Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water. Well? What are you waiting for? No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this. Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary! Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years. Flew. Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention. Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man. You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that? Well then you've got to call her, man. The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up. No You mean...? Huh? But why did Healy? What? Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine. What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy? Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away. I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you! Well... at least now you know. Hey, look on the bright side -- He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down. Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence. Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk. I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing. You're kidding? What did they say? So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up? What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her? Why not? Well why don't you look her up? I mean since then. Whatever happened to Mary? Mary again. Never? Each day is better than the next. Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone? I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys. Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you. Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million? Loser? You? I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo. You're leaving it out. Finish your swing. You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American. I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant. Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls? Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote. Gay? He said you were gay?Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth. I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit. Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class. Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school. Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?We're in love with your roommate. No, thanks. Love a little bundt cake if you have some! You got a brew? Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals... ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.' 'That right? Call you back. You said it, mister. I gotta go. The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did. I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better. Ahh. I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages. Oh yeah. Yep. Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about. Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment. Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there? Hello...? Sully...? Sully, that you? Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting? Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break. I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy. This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer? Here, just have one of these then. Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you. What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead. Tell Bill to get the fuck off! Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right? Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks. Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act. Very nice. Big time. Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend. Thanks. Fucking Sully! Look at you! I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us. Who the hell's Woogie? Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP. No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right? Urrggghh... How's my stomach taste, she says. Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog. You look great. Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants? Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her. Fuck!! Nah, really, it was moronic. No, forget it, it was stupid. Mary ah, forget it. Well, I'll see ya. Yeah... I guess this is it, huh? Wow. I thought I was the only one. -- Love story of our time. Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it. Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude. No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it. Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks. Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies... You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling... Lint? And it doesn't cramp your style? That grandmother of yours -- she's really something. When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism. That...? Vestibule. Deco. What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket? A surprise? The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner? Fine. Fine. Great. Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now? Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me. Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world. Ooh, hey, I gotta run. That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff. Well it's more of an enclosure really. -- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and -- The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with. You know... ...the guys who ride the short bus. I work with retards. I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby. Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card. Some buildings I'm working on. It's right there on your golf bag. I already know it, Mary. Pat Healy. Same here again. Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu. Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway. Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu. Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place. Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins. I'm gonna get a soda, you want one? Thanks. A girl after your own heart, Ted. Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself. What? I don't know what you're talking about. That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy. Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn. Oh Christ... poor dog. That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself! Turn her over to a stalker. Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it. What do you mean 'why'? Hey, hey, hey! Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna. You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too. Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan. It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal. I said buttplug. She's heinous. Rollerpig? Are you nuts? Good good. Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton. Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai. Oh, uh, I resigned. You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy! Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project? Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it. Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you? Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet. Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget. Four kids, three different guys. Nope. Never been. But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds. I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad. Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years. That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school? Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something. I think your life's about to change. I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend. I get one hundred a day plus expenses. Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work. Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case? You want her dead, don't you? She's blackmailing you, right? Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up? I don't buy it. Don't play games with me, Ted. All you want is a phone number? Any idea where I might start looking? So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school. Oh... Sully. You were following us? Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out? You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture. You crossed the line, man. You little fuck. Sully...! What the fuck happened here?! Ho-ly shit. That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him? How many is that? Fucking sickening. Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes. Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line! Nice. How'd you manage that one? And you met Mary how? Bullshit! But... but you knew people at Harvard. What do you mean? You what? That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit? Maybe this'll jog your memory. Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?! Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker? Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there. No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower. Do you know the... soccer stadium? Have you been to Let's see -- Santiago, Chile? Nice smokescreen, isn't it? Well, I'll tell her I ran into you. Among others. You bet. Yes yes, I did get my degree up there. Mainly I work out of Boston. Same here.Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.' Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out. Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for? Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this: Seven-Minute Abs. Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs? A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money. Oh. Well I am. Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something? I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state. Thanks for picking me up.You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty. How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that? Is it the frank or the beans? She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do. Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this! OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! It? Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world. You got what stuck? What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something? Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?! Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie. Yeah? What do you want?Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck. Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second. Well, there's only one thing to do. Is that bubble what I think it is? Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking? Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream. Ho there.Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things. But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did. Why didn't you just tell her the truth? Dumbshit. The sawbones? So where the hell are you, Healy? You found my car?! Who the fuck is it to you? Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore. Am I? No I can't. Healy, what I just tell you? Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too. Nineteen months I been sober. Relax, he just ate. Take it easy, that's Bill. Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore. What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence. I'm doing okay. I gotta get ready for work. Stalker, huh? You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough? Here's the info you asked for. You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser. Healy you dog!No, I just meant... The thing's kind of heavy. I'll try to be more careful. What? I guess. Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track? Jeez, I didn't catch it. Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it. The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony... Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything. But but you're married. You have kids a great wife. Dom? What are you? Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun! Jesus Christ you're right. Huh. I'm usually too tired to be. No. Pipes? What are you talking about? Hm? Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash. Check. Got cash. Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man. Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed. She's even more beautiful than I remember. I don't know what to say. Fuck me. Let's go home. And this adversely affects me how...? Shoot. How the hell did you get here anyway? Yeah feels like it. I am? Fuck calling her. I'm going down there. That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai. Uh-huh. Well think about it. My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe! Mary's a babe! Amen to that. Never met him. Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health... I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment. Wait a second, I never told you that. What's so funny? I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world. What's that, Dom? What's the bright side? That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short. And you think he could find out her number for me? His mother? I don't know about this, Dom. They told me they don't help out stalkers. Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time. I also called Unsolved Mysteries. I did try calling her. A few years ago. She wasn't listed. Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single. Yeah, right. I don't know. I told you, her family moved to Miami. Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years. Well once. Mary. Nah. It must be great with a wife like that. Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion? What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump. Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser. Good-looking? What's he like? Come on, that wouldn't make me gay. Yeah, but he was successful. He implied it. A convention? How'd you see her at a convention? Mary. Bob, do you remember Mary? Out getting coffee. It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair. Oh come on, why would I lie? Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser. Who? Who? Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal? I'm talking about the letter, asshole. Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you? Your turn? You're a sick man, you know that? What?! You're calling me a stalker? Do what? Answer the question, shitball. You fucked me, man? Why would you do that? Surprised? Mary's a mail-order bride? Japan? What's she doing in Japan? Oh. I thought That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her. All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out. The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes. But you said she was a sparkplug...? Well I think you're right, I should look her up. Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me. Jai alai? Miami? What are you doing? Uh, that's okay. Thanks, Healy. Good work. It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought... She's in a wheelchair?! Oh my. Three different guys? Huh? So she's married? Mary's a little chubby, huh? No, not at all. So she hasn't changed? So you found Mary? Really? Very, very? You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses. Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing. I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine. You can't be serious. No. No. You don't buy what? I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador. Well, I know you're busy... She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then. Uh-huh. Huh. That sounds great. Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs. How do you guarantee that? I'd go with the seven. I see where you're going. The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V. 'That right? Good for you. Hm? Nah. I'm... I'm nothing. That must make it tough. No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight. Really? But but what about Steve? I... I just want you to be happy, Mary. What what are you doing here? You're Woogie? Okay. Mary, come on... I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again. Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you. Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought -- Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know -- Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy? Yeah, sure. All right, let's go. Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure. Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks. Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead. Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect. What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single? We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot. Trying to be. Well... why don't you move back? Yeah? Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers. You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver. I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat. That's more like it. Two more nitrate-sicles please. Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady. What are you? No short game. Jeez, Mary... I'm... Now by killer, you mean...? Sure. Hm? You look great. Hey. Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years. Don't make me wait another day. Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times? Oh... are you... ? Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets. God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson. Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down. No, it was a good thing. I mean, good in that it was very quick. He's dead. Really? I never got a message. Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars. Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda. You asshole, what are you -- Mary! Is that you? You betcha! Just a minute. Oh yeah. Oh. Okay. I gotcha. Hi, Mary. I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year. Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb. Huh? A real Clydesdale, huh Warren? No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school. No, it's an old football injury. Oh yeah. Fine. No, that's really unneces -- I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan. One guess. I think a little of both. What?! No please, sir -- Shhhhhh! It. I, uh... I got it stuck. I wish. I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball. Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom. No, no, please! What do you mean? Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us. Oh. Oh, that's a good one. No! I was pissing! No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning. I wasn't trying -- Oh God. Okay. So is that a yes or a no? Uh-huh. It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want. Great. Great. So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me. So what's up? See you, Warren. See you, Warren. I'm gonna take a rain check. How are you doing, Warren? Jesus, I think her brother spotted me. We're here, Warren. You wanna get off? I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it? Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve? Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit. What? Hey, this is a pretty nice place. I never said that. Four. That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch! Why you son of a -- What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war! Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up. Friend. Baseball bat. Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back. ...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn. I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else. My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas. I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year? Estadio Olimpico -- please! I'm a phony -- just like you, man. You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her. Who? Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid. You know, I really should take your card. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style? Did you build the Estadio Olympico? Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours? Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids. You mean him. Kim and I are close friends! Did you study under Kim Greene? Harvard? Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there? Pleasure to meet you, Patrick. Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks. Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there. Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head. The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off. Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay. I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights. After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on. Mary, the man's a killer. I think you'd better sit down. Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy. Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit. I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there. I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy. Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus. That's what you've been looking for -- a farter? Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him? You don't think they're too big? What's up, Doc? Where would I have seen your work? Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?Bye, Ted. Huh...? Good, Ted. Piggy back ride? Franks and beans! Giddy-up. Piggyback ride.
