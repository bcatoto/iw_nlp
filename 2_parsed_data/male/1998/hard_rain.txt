So, are we all going to die? Not right now. But I'm gonna have to  let out a little more. I think my best was when I turned  twelve. My Dad set up a treasure  hunt. It was really cool. Well, it was. This blows. My most awful birthday was sweet  sixteen. I had mono. How about you?  What was your worst? You kidding? You think I could've  possibly had a birthday worse than  this? What kind of loser do you think  I am? Don't answer that, Phil. Hank says he's gonna open another  gate. We're gonna get another rise. Gentlemen. Hey -- happy birthday,  Wayne. Mike, I gotta say, what you're  doing... I don't know if I'd be here,  considering. Well, you would be if you wanted to  get the last couple of paychecks  some bastard owed you. I just want you to know I think the  people 'round here made a big mistake. "The people"? You're the one who  screwed him. Sorry, Phil? I, uh -- You know, Bob, as much as I'd love  to stand here all day talking about  how great I am, if you don't get  moving I'm gonna have to haul your  sorry ass off to jail. Okay, okay, I'm going. Keep up the  good work, boys. It's appreciated. Whaddya say we go torch the fucker's  house and blame it on looters. Or  how about we put a dead cow in his  living room. He comes back after  it's been in the water a couple of  days. Hello! You wanna know how to get the best  revenge on the Mayor and his boys?  You do exactly what we're doing. You  protect the town. You protect it  better than they would. Better than  they ever could. I think the dead cow's better. Any looter that comes in here is in  for a big surprise, cause as long as  I'm still wearing this pointy thing... ...nobody's taking anything from  this town. Do you think you could go a little  faster, pal? I -- I'm going as fast as I can. Well, it's not fast enough. That it? Yes. We don't keep any of our -- Hey, wait! Excuse me? You forgot to sign. Okay. For Christsakes! It's a flood, Charlie. You're gonna  get wet. Hey! Do you know what kind of crap  is in that water? Well, yeah. Dispatch, this is 31. Go ahead, 31. We're leaving Huntingburg. We'll be  back in an hour. Ten-four. Get out of there. We're gone. Over and out. What? Your ear. What about my ear? You've got a major hair growth going  on. Shut up. I'm serious. You're gonna need  somebody to go in there with a weed  whacker. Here. You're offering me one of your donuts?  I don't know what to say. I'm getting  all misty. If it'll shut your mouth you can  have the whole bag. Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll  never get out of this truck. I love how you think you're better  than this. Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's  a lot to like about this job -- and  I don't just mean the dashing  polyester ensemble and the solid  three-figure income. You ungrateful shit! I don't believe  you! Charlie, relax! I was kidding! You don't wanna do this? Fine. Go  back to selling hot construction  machinery. That's a helluva career. It had better hours. You think this is a joke? This is  funny? Jesus Christ! You know how  lucky you are you could get in here?  Thirty years old and all the crap  you pulled and you never got caught? That wasn't luck, old man. That was  skill. I was good at it. Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to  fence bulldozers. That's goddamn  genius time. About as much skill as it takes to  sit in a truck and get fat eating  donuts. Oh, so that's all I've been doing,  huh? Just wasting my life away. I didn't say that. Yeah, building a home, raising a  family -- that's just stupid. I didn't say that! You know what, Tom? I really don't  give a shit what you said. "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters  shall rise up out of the north and  be an overflowing flood and all the  inhabitants of the land shall howl."  Jeremiah 47:2. You're gonna be able to buy a helluva  lot of bibles, huh, Ray? Me? First  thing I'm gonna do is get my brother  a lawyer. Best that money can buy. What's he facing? Thirty in. He cap a cop or something...? Security guard. "In the commission..."  All he's got is a piece of shit P.D.  Now I'm gonna be able to afford him  a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut. 'Scuse me a second. Take a look at  thirty-one across. Shit, Jim. I don't do crossword  puzzles. I'll take a look, Jim. Kenny can read. Just look at it. You know when you  write down a word and suddenly it  looks all wrong? Maybe it's right,  but it doesn't look right? Thirty-one across. Mention money again and... Did I get it right? Yeah, Jim. You got it right. Jerk. Jack-ass. Give us a kiss. Come on. Get out of here. You really are a cranky old fart,  you know that? I'm sorry. What was that about? I mean, I'm  just sitting here and all of a sudden  you go postal on me. I don't know, I... It's just this  weather. I... I want to get back. You know, I really do appreciate  what you've done for me. This is a  good job. No, it's not. It stinks. It's putting  your life on the line for someone  else's money. Jesus. Where's the road? It's there. Somewhere. I hope. Look, Tom, I don't care what it is  you end up doing. Oh, God, here we go again. This is the last time, I swear. I just think, whatever it is you do,  it's time you did some heavy lifting. Stop! No, you gotta hear this. You're better  than -- Stop the truck! We're going down! Jesus! Back up! Goddammit! It's a little dip in the road or  something. You can see the reflectors  come up the other side. I knew this would happen. I'll see if there's anyone coming.  Maybe we can get pulled out. Dispatch, this is 31. 31 calling  dispatch. 31, this is dispatch. Dispatch, we're stuck outside of  Huntingburg. Truck's dead. Where are you? We're on 231, headed for the  Interstate. Right by a sign saying  "Welcome to Huntingburg." The town's been evacuated. We won't  get any help from there. Dispatch can't get anyone out. They are aware we're carrying a  shitload of money...? They called the National Guard.  They're gonna be here in about ninety  minutes. Ninety minutes? Jesus. Dispatch, we're gonna need help a  little sooner than -- Oh, shit. Henry, I saw you. Come on out. Henry, I'm not leaving until you  come out. What are you still doing here? We're just -- That's illegal, Doreen. Doreen... You don't need to set traps. That's not happening this time. You can't stay, you know that. We're going to my sister's. Good. God'll understand if you have to  drown her in the basement, Henry. We gotta get out of here. What about the money? The money's safe; we're not. Water  rose about a foot in the last twenty  minutes. The National Guard isn't  going to be here for another hour.  You do the math. Hello! You okay? You stuck? Yes! We'll see if we can get you out!  We'll be right over! Looks like we might just -- Why'd they do that? Probably so they can see better. Or so we can't see at all. This is my retirement fund, boys,  and if any one of you screws up, I  swear to God I'll kill you. Let's  go. Company dispatch and the National  Guard are the only ones who know  we're here. Anyone with a scanner from Radio  Shack could've intercepted your call,  Charlie. Jesus. Could you turn down your lights?! We're bringing a rope! Turn down your lights! We'll be right there! Take it easy, Tom. STOP SHOOTING! Stop. I'm sorry, Tom. He was going for his gun! He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny.  Goddamnit! We just want the money! Get away and  we won't have to kill you! Now! You got thirty seconds to get the  hell away! The clock's running! Go! Ah, Jesus. Your dad'd be real proud of you,  Kenny. He was going for his gun! Mr. Mehlor, I believe we're gonna  need your science project. "I shall bring floodwaters upon the  earth to destroy all that lives under  the heavens and every creature that  has the breath of life in it shall  perish." Genesis 6:17. Were you a preacher or something? Ray did five years in the hole at  Joliet. The only thing you get to  read in the hole is the Bible. You got religion? Obviously. When you hit the switch you've got  thirty seconds. You teach your students how to make  things like that? You been to a high school recently,  Ray? My students taught me how to  make things like that. Ready? Hold on. Shut up. Everyone. Now why'd he have to go and do a  thing like that? To stay alive. He thinks we'll kill him -- unless  he knows where the money is and we  don't. There is another possibility. He's thinking of keeping it for  himself. There's always that. Either way, we  got ourselves a sharp one. What do we do? Pretty soon the water'll be too deep  for him to run. But for us it'll be  just deep enough. Deep enough for what? Here we go. What about this monster? This is all we need. Shit, Jim, we're stealing. Can't we  take anything we want? The water isn't very deep yet. We  need something with a low draft. Mr.  Mehlor -- find us some gasoline. Oh, Jim...? Cut your engines! Let's get him out. But for Godsake,  whatever you do... ...don't kill him. Not until we find  out where he hid that money. Mr. Mehlor? Enemy sub off the port bow! Full steam ahead! Low tide, sailor. Kenny? See him? Yee-hah! Nice driving, buttwipe! I'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny,  but if he's dead, how do we find the  money? Oh, he's still alive. Ray, I'm in need of a little  inspiration. "With a raging flood he makes an end  of those who oppose him, and pursues  his enemies into darkness." From one  of the more obscure -- Sorry to interrupt Bible study and  all, but has no one but me noticed  how completely screwed we are? We  should be back in the motel room,  counting out the money. Instead -- No one likes this particular turn of  events, Kenny, but we have a choice --  we can can either deal with it or we  can walk away. There's a lot of money  out there, so I choose to deal with  it. If you want to go, that's fine --  start swimming. You want to stay,  that's fine, too -- just stop your  damn whining. What the hell's his problem? All the  money in the world ain't worth a  goddamn nickel if you get caught.  It's not like there won't be other  jobs. You may have more of these in you,  Kenny, but Jim doesn't. What are you doing here? I sure as hell don't get what you  see in that church. What's that supposed to mean? Karen, did you think the order was  for everyone but you to evacuate? I think it's great what you did. That's it, Phil. That'll finally get  you into her pants. Shut up. What if he'd had a gun, Karen? A lot  of these looters carry guns. I'm not a looter. Jim, it could be anywhere. It might  not even be in the school. Keep looking. What were you doing at the church? I just said I'm not a looter! You're the one who nailed me? You got a better arm than my ex-wife.  What the hell did you hit me with --  a statue? I saw a flash of some guy  coming at me. Oh, great. Now I'm gonna have people  coming from around the world to see  the face of Jesus on my forehead. Look, son, what were you doing in  the church? Looking for a place to hide out. From who -- Swamp Thing? The bastards who killed my partner. We were driving an armored truck.  The truck got stuck out past the  high school. They must've picked up  our call to dispatch, 'cause they  knew where we were. Charlie and I  were just standing there and all  hell broke loose. How much money did you have? A little over three million. The bank was afraid of looters. They  had us cleaning out their branches  up and down the river. They stole three million dollars? No, I don't think so. You took the money, didn't you. I hid it in the cemetery. Tied it to  a crypt for a guy named Portman. What the hell'd you do that for? I don't like to carry around that  much cash. Jesus, Wayne, use your head. If he  hadn't hidden it, they woulda killed  him, too. You got any ID? No, it was in my jacket and I -- Color me surprised. Get out two rifles and a shotgun. You believe him? Well, yes, Wayne, I do. And even if  I didn't, I'd say we sure as hell  had an obligation to check it out,  don't you think? I'll go with you. I can show you  where -- No, I think you better stay put. But  that was -- Yeah, all we need is an armored car  guy helping us out. Ow! Wayne, what's the worst that's ever  happened to you? When old Mrs. Dugan  went after you with a knife? This  guy just got shot at! Smart move with the money. Wayne and I'll check out the cemetery.  You escort Slugger... ...out of town. Get her to some high  ground, then come on back. Not any more you don't. Wayne... He could still be lying! Sheriff -- they killed my partner  without any warning. And they're gonna regret that, I  guarantee you. They're gonna regret  coming anywhere near this town  tonight. And out he goes. Phil, take Karen's boat. You can do it, Phil. The men of  Huntingburg are counting on you. Just bite me. Holy shit! Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff, come in! Karen, you know I'd do anything for  you, but the Sheriff told me to get  you out of town. I'm sorry. It's for  your own good. What're you doing? No. Hey, hold on. Wayne... You locked him in. Great! I can drive out of here! Thank you. Even. What happened? Oh, God. They're in the water! Kenny, cut  your engine! Kenny, go that way. We'll go down  here. I can't. If they know where the money is,  they will kill us. I guess just drive around until we  run out of gas. When we get down here a little further  we'll find a place for you to hide. I'm gonna get back to the truck and  wait for the National Guard. They should be there pretty soon. Cold? Is he dead? No. Someone got him out. Who? Maybe Karen. Karen? How could she get him out?  You took her out of town. I -- It -- Let's hear it, Phil. It happened real fast, okay? No. The scariest thing that ever  happened before was Charlie running  out of donuts. I've only been doing this for a couple  months. I, uh... I sold construction  machinery. I was making good money, it just...  I don't know. It just didn't seem  right for me anymore. My uncle did me a favor; got me in. My uncle was Charlie -- my partner  in the truck. She know karate or something, Phil?  Maybe kung fu? I mean, I can't see  how else she could overpower the  likes of you. Shut up, Wayne. Shut up, both of you. Let's go find  Karen; see if she's got him. God, I wonder whose car this is. Really? Hold on... ...I think this is my car from high  school. Looks like we get out here. Come on -- I told your father I'd  have you home by ten. There! Get your feet up! Oh, shit! It's metal! We've gotta --! HEY! I GOT HIM! We have to --! I GOT HIM! Jesus Christ! Jim! Over there! Doreen? You haven't killed anybody,  have you? Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole  gang. Jesus, God, it hurts! You're gonna be okay, Ken. Mr. Mehlor  knows these things and he thinks  you're gonna be okay. It hurts! Don't you, Mr. Mehlor? Don't you  think Kenny's gonna be okay? Yeah, Kenny. You're gonna be fine. Jesus, I can't stop shivering. I know you didn't want me to come. You kidding? We couldn't've done  anything without you. My dad'd sure be pissed off, huh? Your dad'd just want you to lay still  while we got you some help. Hey -- hey the pain's goin'. Oh, man. When you said I was gonna be okay, I  thought you were just shittin' me. See? You gotta trust me. We are not going to send these people  out to the wolves. I -- I just don't think -- It's okay. I have to go anyway. The National Guard'll be at the truck  in about fifteen minutes. I'm gonna  go wait for them. He could take our boat. I'll go get it ready for you. Karen? I'm Tom. You wanna come with me? Why don't we just get him? If our resourceful young friend hears  us coming, he'll electrocute us or  sink us or one of you'll shoot him.  Besides... ...I know where he's going. What I'd  like to know is where he came from. They're not here. Son, before you go underwater and do  something tricky, there's something  I'd like you to see! Now, I know it's your job to protect  that money, and maybe you'd even be  foolish enough to give your life for  it. The question is, are you willing  to give their lives for it? Drop the gun and get into the boat. Excellent choice. I'll take you to the money, but you  gotta let them go. Shh. I think it'd be best if -- Doreen, please. I think it'd be best if we all stayed  together. You say all you want is the money?  Prove it. Let them go. I don't know if that's -- Let 'em go. Karen? In the attic. They never saw her. I'm gonna row back there and see if  he'll shoot you. Or me. Fine either  way. Do you want me to get us out of here? Then shut the fuck up. I... The only thing I want to hear from  you is where the money is. I wonder where they think they're  going. What the hell's going on? This happened in a flood in Georgia.  The ground gets soggy, and the caskets  are air-tight -- anyone who hasn't  been planted too long just pops up. You teach your students stuff like  that? No wonder they kicked you out. I didn't teach my students anything  at all. Where is it? It's hard to tell now with the water  so deep. It's down there a little further. It's Tom now. Looks like you lost  out, pal. Where was he going? Here? Uh... no. A little farther -- They're not coming, son. What? The National Guard. They're not  coming. I don't -- I know you've been trying to stall  until they show up, but they're not  coming. Oh, God. You intercepted Charlie's  call, then you called them off. No, son, I didn't call them off.  They never were coming. We didn't  "intercept" Charlie's call. He called  us direct. I'd love to help you, Sheriff, but I  can't leave! If the water goes over  the top again it's bye-bye, dam! Bye- bye, town! In fact, I could use a  little help up here myself. Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed  up in Jack Finch's barn and said he  was gonna burn it down? Hey, I was the one who got the dumb  son-of-a-bitch to come out. Right. And before you went in, I  deputized you, you dumb son-of-a- bitch! So when I say get down here,  it's not a request, it's an order.  So get down here! Now! I won't need  you for long. And bring your gun. We were gonna hit you just before  you got on the Interstate, but then  you got stuck so we had to change  our plans and take you -- Bullshit. This is all bullshit. I knew Charlie when we were both  working construction for the Johnstown  company. His middle name was McCarthy  because his parents loved Charlie  McCarthy on the radio. His wife's  name was Mary. She died of a heart- attack last year. He has a daughter  and a son, both grown with children  of their own. I'm afraid I don't  know the names of the grandchildren. What else do I know...? Oh, yes. I  know Uncle Charlie was trying to  steer his favorite nephew away from  a life of crime. Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie  and you get to keep another share? No, That was an accident. Ken shot  him. I never told him Charlie was on my  side. Ken liked to talk. He shouldn't've been here. But his  dad asked me to watch over him. I  guess I didn't do the best job. Excuse me, Jim. I hate to interrupt  and all, but could we just get the  money and get the hell out of here? I'm gonna ask you one more time. And  before you think of bullshitting me  again, keep in mind I have had a  very frustrating night. And while I  know I'll never get the money if I  kill you, it's getting to the point  where I just don't care. I'll tell you where it is. But it's  not going to do you any good. The Guard may not be coming, but  someone else sure as hell is. I'll take my chances. There. Well, go get it. "At night we'd go down to the river  and into the river we'd dive." Springsteen, "The River." I'm all  out of bible quotes. It's gone. What? Looks like somebody beat you to it. Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot  him, Jim. Hold your fire! Now, sir, I can imagine you'd love  nothing more than to shoot me, but I  caution you -- in order to do that,  you're gonna have to shoot through  young Tom here. Okay. Well, that was unexpected. Is he the one you thought was coming  to your rescue? Anyone mind telling me what the hell  is going on? Hey, Hank. That money I told you  about? From the armored car? We're  gonna keep it. Three million dollars.  Four ways. Seven fifty apiece. You okay with  that? Hank? You okay with that? Seven hundred and fifty thousand  dollars? Damn straight I'm okay with that. Don't see what we needed him for. Then I guess you've never been hunting  with Hank. We got two behind that crypt. Get  'em. Maybe I'm not okay with it. Come on now, Phil. You're gonna kill people? They're looters, Phil! They come and  steal from an armored truck in our  town -- they're looters. What about Tom? What about Karen?  They're not looters. No, they're witnesses. How can you do this? Jeez, Phil, I always thought Wayne  was the stupid one. Read my lips. Three million dollars. Look at it! A couple of those bags are gonna be  yours, Phil. But -- but -- you're the Sheriff! I'm the what? For twenty years you've been -- For twenty years I've been eating  shit, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Well, tonight I'm changing the menu!  From now on everything I eat is gonna  be shit-free! Can I make it any clearer, Phil? Do  you want me to draw pictures? I can't let you do it. Oh for -- Okay, Phil. But here's how it's gonna  go. I'm gonna hear one of two things  out of you. Either I'm gonna hear  you say you're in with us, or... ...I'm gonna hear a bullet come out  of that gun and go into me. Seven hundred and fifty thousand  dollars or... ...you kill me. Your choice. There we go. In the boat! You really want that money? 'Cause the only way you're ever gonna  see it is if you help me get Karen. We're too slow. Here. They're not going to catch us now. Okay, so maybe they are gonna catch  us now. That hurt? Yeah. Good. Then go get some bottles. Wait -- what about the dam? It'll be fine. You said if it goes it'll wipe out  the town. Fuck the town. Does he have the girl? She's in the small boat. Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis. Hepatitis, hell. You probably already  got cholera. What're you doing? There's a back room. Maybe they've got something I can  use on this. You been in here before? Oh, yeah. What happened? I saw Jesus. So, has this all gone pretty much  how you thought it would? Everything would have gone fine if  you'd've just walked away from the  truck. Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've  gone even better if you hadn't decided  to rob the damn truck in the first  place! Did Charlie have cancer or something? You mean why was he doing this? No cancer. Didn't you ever think about taking  the money? No. Come now. A man who used to make his  living fencing hot jackhammers never  thought about what he'd do with three  million dollars? Sorry to disappoint you. What are you gonna do with it? As little as possible. Belize. It's this small country in Central  America, on the Atlantic side. I know where Belize is. What about  it? They speak English and the dollar  goes a long way. Beautiful beaches;  friendly people. And they've got  liberal banking laws. Very liberal. No, you didn't think about taking  that money at all. You can't ride in the truck and not  think about it. I'm sure. And I guess that's pretty  much how it started with Charlie. What're you doing? We got too many bodies with bullets  in 'em. I'm gonna put her in her house, make  it look like she fell down the stairs  and drowned. Don't you touch her! Saving her life... Hmm... You know,  that might have actually gotten you  laid. Oh, for Christsakes, just dump her  here. We got a few minutes before Hank  gets back. Just dump her here! Wayne! Goddamnit, we've gotta get  them outta there! Wayne! Shit. Where's he going? Where's Wayne going? On a date. You all set? Yeah, but -- Then let's go. Aren't we gonna wait for Wayne? We can get started without him, the  dumb shit. He won't be long. Besides,  we got Phil. Phil's gonna earn his  money on this, aren't you Phil? What -- you're gonna swim after her? You ain't gonna help her by getting  shot. He's gone and you don't know  where. The Sheriff knows. I think maybe  I'll go ask him. You'll be dead before you get over  the sandbags. Look, he'll be coming for us. You  can ask him then. What if he doesn't come? I wouldn't worry about that. Wakey-wakey. Dear Penthouse: I always thought  your letters were fake, until the  wildest thing happened to me. I'm a  policeman in a small town. In the  middle of the big flood last year, I  was patrolling the streets in a boat,  feeling kind of sorry for myself --  'cause it was my birthday and all --  when I saw the front door to a house  was open. I pulled my gun -- afraid  it might be looters. Imagine my  surprise when, instead of a looter,  I find a young woman handcuffed to  the railing of her stairs. Her name  was Karen, and ever since she came  back from college she'd made it clear  she was too good for any of us local  folk. Now here she was, in handcuffs!  I said, "What the heck is going on  here, ma'am?" And she said... And she said... You're perfect for the role. I suggest  you reconsider. I might get clumsy. It might take a  while. And she said, "Happy Birthday, Wayne.  I've got something for you." Well,  I'm not stupid. I knew what she wanted  to give me and I knew she wanted to  give it bad, so I -- That won't do. Man's gotta see what  he's doing. 'Scuse me. I got the candles. All's we need is  a cake. Mood lighting. You in the mood yet? And then she said, "My present's  ready and waiting. All's you gotta  do is unwrap it." It was cold and rainy that birthday  night, and all I wanted was to get  someplace warm and dry. As it turned  out, what I really wanted was  something warm and wet. Wayne grins  and closes for a kiss and... They're not coming out, Hank! The fire's not catching. The rain's  too -- We have to get them! We have to kill  them! Do you understand? If they're  not dead, we got jack shit! My God they're beautiful. Where are they?! Jesus! You take care of him! Kill him! Kill him! No! We can't -- In the boat. Where's Karen? Where is she? They went back to her house. Where's her house? It's -- What in God's name is that? Hank? It's topped out. How much time we got? How should I know? Guess! It's an old dam! Not long. Then I'd say you boys better drop  your guns. What? That's the deal! You let me and Hank  go -- with a few of these bags --  and I'll tell you where to find Karen. Get out of the boat. Hold on. Hold on? It's the only way you're gonna find  her! It's only a couple of bags. No. But I thought -- Look, I don't know what you thought  but I told you, I'm here for the  money; that's all. She lives on Boyd Street. Three over. Two-story, blue shutters. So, you just gonna kill me? Lord knows I should. I'm guessing you can't get up. Where? Is that good or bad? You should've just killed me. I owe you one. NOOOO! We gotta go faster! Yeah, you're right. Oh my God. Next time, when I say "Let's  evacuate," we're gonna evacuate. You okay? Fine. Oh, God. We gotta get you to -- Thanks. For what? You just saved our lives. I did? I just came for the money. No. Tell her to stay back. It's okay! You're going to turn it in? Sorry to disappoint you. Well, hell, then I guess I better  take it after all. I figure the  river'll carry me down to the Gulf  of Mexico. If I catch the right  currents, maybe I'll end up in...  Belize? You come look me up. I'll buy you a  drink. I'll do that. Go. Please. Son, don't think too badly of your  Uncle Charlie. He always said you  were capable of remarkable things. He was right. The rain's stopped. The air after a rain... They got a lot done today. Barbecue chicken from Lilly's. You want some? I wish you'd told me.  I woulda got more. I talked to Mikey. He says the  flooring should be in by Friday. I said if it wasn't here by Friday  at six that you were going to go  over and beat the crap out of him.
