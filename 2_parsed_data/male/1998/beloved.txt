I will. Well, good luck with the job. You grown. Well, if you want my opinion... You think she sure 'nough your sister? She gone like they say? That girl...You know, Beloved... You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it? Your mother all right? They treating you right over at the Bodwins? You on your way home? Well, is it now? How you getting along? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take? Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump. She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me. Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl... Leave off.. You don't know what I think. Jesus. What yard? When who- I don't want to know. There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me. Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub. They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth.. Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free? I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder. You remember your price, Stamp? Oh yeah. I got big plans. Just me. Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell. For what? If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow... What, baby? Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now. Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!? You got to get up from here, girl. Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed? I saw Denver. She tell you? Yeah. Look bad? Sethe?Yeah. Too sweet. Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it. What? What? You talking back to me? What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here." The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here. You remember Halle. I don't know. Maybe we should have moved. No. Sorry. No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies.. We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby. That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever.. Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing! Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams.. Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you. Baby, don't be like that. NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING. I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN. WILL YOU STAY? YOU NEVER FORGOT ME? YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME? DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE. No...no...no.. She likes this dress... Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right... NO!...She wanted me to do it. Go upstairs I said!! Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up. Morning. OUT THERE. WAY OFF. DO YOU FORGIVE ME? Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter... The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be. I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside. No, let her rest. Could be that fall you took. Back stiff? She was my best thing. She left me. She's gone again. Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all. I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while. She comes in the daytime. She still with me, my Denver. No, You looking good. You shaved. Paul D. Make it the way I always do. I'm telling you don't say nothing to me. Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle? Aw, Baby. You still know. You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right. You punishing Him, ain't you? You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood? You saying nothing counts? You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying? You blaming God. That what you're doing? Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what? You getting into bed to think about yellow? What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here. But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there. The Word. What you was put here to speak. Say the Word! This Saturday - you coming to Call or what? Well? Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard. Here, let me carry that. Folks came. You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one. That's so. Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too. He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at. I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day. I run him off. What's any of that got to do with Paul D.? Ella. You was friends. Aw, no, Ella. You know she married Baby Suggs' boy. Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this. Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to- It's her, ain't it? You know he's colored? What else there to know? Why's that necessary all of a sudden? NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way? Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?! It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in. The church! Can't locate him. True. I know what I see. I know Denver. Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is. That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people. Was over to Baby Suggs. Oh I been out. All he can. All he can. She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe? Who is she? Where she come from? You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you. She was only- She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all. It ain't what you think. I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it. I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other. I don't believe that. I won't. Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing. No use thinking these things now. Never found out. You planning to do anything about it? Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy. You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night. I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize. This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first. Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that.. No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway. Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe. Yes sir.Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me? You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse. I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road. Hey!!
