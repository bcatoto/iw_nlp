I don't know what you're - Dwayne listen to me - I can't get enough of it. Damn. None of them had any -- Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here -- one of them's still alive. Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin? Rock solid. Uh huh. I can't. I can't go on. I can't keep lying...killing. That's not me. That's not US. It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that? It's about Yes it is. I'm calling it in. Right now. It's too late... What are you talking about? Dwayne's dead. No. It stops now. It stops here. He killed her... He found us, he shot her...he killed her... He killed her...he killed her... Then Sally comes too. We've got to go now, then. We're not? How do you figure that? Then we're screwed. It was all used. Random numbers. How can they trace it? I sure as hell hope so. Let's go. Maybe we should say somethin'. You don't know if he was really gonna -- Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?... Like hell it is. This is Jesse! Jesse! You killed him... Here it is. What are you thinking? We were only supposed to scare him! How long is it going to take?! Not bad enough to kill him. You're crazy. Well what are we supposed to do? Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape. Look, Earl. We gotta go straight. This is all messed up... No. Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse. You said that last time! We had a deal! What was I, talking to the wall? He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not. He's probably made copies. He's not going to give them up to us. And how do you figure we do that? ...Or get rid of the money. I don't know. Well doesn't he? Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now. Just call it the cost of doing business. This whole thing is screwed up. I'm thinking. Maybe we should tell 'em the truth... All right enough! I'm tired of thinking about all this! He would have done it to us, right? That's not what I mean. I can't do that. You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one. What are you thinking? He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it! I should have known something like this was going to happen! It's the right thing to do. We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape. Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl. I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape... We assaulted a Federal agent. We killed him. That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us. This isn't a joke. What are we going to do! We're dead. We're dead, We are dead... What are we going to do?! Forget it. We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down. And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it. Understand? Look. Dwayne was right. This is going to be a big story. So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around. I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that! We tried to murder someone to cover our asses! That's not what I mean. I...I can't do that. You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one... What are you thinking? He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it! He saw everything! Well, I don't know. I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too -- Shhh! We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions. I've got one condition. I don't know. Torch it?! I do. It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this! All right hold on! Lemme think... Shit, did you touch the car? At the expense of six people. Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks? What makes you so sure? It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it? Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions. I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why! It won't work. Well someone's gonna find them. We don't know that. We don't know whose money it is! They might have robbed a bank, who knows? No. We can't. Call it in I guess. Why? What do you mean what are we going to do? Shit, more than that. Ten thousand right here. What the hell... I probably would have. I guess the clues damn near before everyone. Never heard of it. Cash and what? Seven thousand... I hear you. Well I hope so. That pretty much cleaned me out. The horniest dog in Nevada. Don't spend it all in one place. Sure thing, and -- What are you doing, Earl? Whoa, Earl! Shut up, Jesse. Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that! You don't expect us to believe that do you? No. It's not. Just take it in stride. None of us like it! What are you proposing? Two thousand... How much? That's the deal. If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins. We're going to wait. All of us, until everything dies down. All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition. What's your offer, Jesse? Why don't you get to the point. Yeah? So? What's that? You mean that guy was an agent? Could it have been in the Mercedes? No. Why? How are ya? Sally, do you love me? I swear to you, it's true... Things just got a little screwed up, that's all. Yeah. I want to tell you everything. Yeah, it is... We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met. Sally there's a whole world out there. We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump. What are you giving up? Why does that bother you? It'll be more than enough. We can get out of here... Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe. I'll be there for you. He won't try anything while I'm there. I promise. I'll protect you. I'm going to quit. That's what has to happen first. Then we're going to tell him. Well I was just throwing out ideas... I love you Sally. We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside... Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place. We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish... It doesn't matter...he's next to you. You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you? Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you. Dammit, I'm so sick of this. Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all. Great... How the hell did he find it? You're worth every last penny. There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here. And I'd take it out on him. That son of a bitch. Like hell it's over. You told me he wasn't doing this anymore. Nothing happened? What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing... You deserve it is the occasion. Sally? I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave. I love you too. I'm just tired is all. I'll see you tonight OK baby? Yeah I'm fine. OK. Nothing's wrong. Nothing. I know. Yeah. Hi. I might have to look into that... No. But he would, probably. Ah hell, he'd do the same for me. Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind. They're going to take his car. Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three. I gotta take some money out, that's what for. I have to go to the bank before it closes.A week ago, at most. I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here. Yeah, I've seen him.What is this? Don't be stupid man... What? And what's that? What? You said that, I didn't. Business is business. Now where the hell is it? I wanna get out of here. That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying? Yeah.Don't lie to me!!!! Shut up! Not another word out of you! You're going down, the Feds know all about it! You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest? I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you! Whatsamatter with you? Aren't you concerned about all of this? I want to get some hounds down here. I'd like to know what they were doing in my town! Did you get ID off any of them? What the hell happened here? Sort of! What do you think about all this? This just might be our ticket! We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity. Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads... Jesus, seven dead. I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts. I don't like it. Not in my jurisdiction. Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that. All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf. Did you say After Midnight? Fine. The information doesn't leave this room. Dwayne. Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here. Have you known this all along? Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all. Maybe I should come along. Why would someone do that? What are you getting at? Don't you think I would have told you that! Well we'd like to help you in any way we can. We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers. Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that. I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved -- Excellent. I'll go down with you. That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office? I guess we can get started. Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT Lingerie... What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something? So there was money there! Who the hell's money is it?! Is this marked money, or what? A lot of men come in here? I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff. Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not. No I don't. You sure you haven�t seen her? Yeah I'd say C...C. Uh...C? Oh. Shopping here? I don't suppose you've seen her. Yeah, she is. She comes up to about here on me. Sixty five... Jeez Louise! Well I don't know... I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special. Well I just uh, you know... Hi. You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich. Something wrong, Jesse? Nice of you to join us. I did say three o'clock, didn't I? I have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding. So be here at three. Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can. Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us. Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock? Jesse? She's not his type. Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse? Take it or leave it. Dammit you�re persistent. I don�t want to listen to this anymore. No more bets with you. All right you�re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal? He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play. Just goes to show you. Calm down -- You'd do this to me! You'd do this to me?! Shut up!!! Slut!!! You shut your mouth you son of a bitch! Save me the sermon. I've heard it all before, it's boring. Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace! Is that asking too much? Yeah let's hear about your day. Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time... Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you. Not much to tell. Nothing really happened. Nothing. Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went? Watch that. Watch that tone. What are you saying? A surprise huh? Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them! Forget it. Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing? Hey where's the hot pad? What's this?And you're solid on that? That'll bring me down, too. Eventually. You gotta know that. Just one more. This one knocks off all the rest. You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth. We're home free! We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours. It's NOT too late! Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us. He was at the scene. He grabbed the cash. Of course. This is perfect! I know, I know. Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it. We'll pin it on him. The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone. No radio. They couldn't have called me in. What do you mean? Look. We can make still make it work. We got to get out of here. Do you understand? We got to get out of here right now! Booth, listen to me...Booth! What happened? What's Earl doing here? Oh Jesus... That's right. We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it. No we're not. I don't know. They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays. I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank? Do you have everything? Come on. Booth grabs the bag -- Yes I DO! It never woulda stopped, you know that. Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives. We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves! It's gonna be o.k. Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up! There it is...now what about the others? I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk. I don't know! Shit, give me a break! Who said anything about killing? Just keep driving straight... How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail? I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl -- I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch! Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do. If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that! Neither do I. You think he's bluffing? You're out of your mind. Well I mean it this time. Come on. Let's get this over with! For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all! You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down. He's going to be trouble. Forget the copies! He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original. All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape. We'll set him up somehow. I've got a better idea. All we have to do is straighten out Jesse. Well I'm not! Thinks he's got us by the balls. I could kill that no good son of a bitch! Exactly. This is our little secret, partner. Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do. Okay then. I'll do it. Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's just a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway. I don't know... Shit! We're gonna have to get rid of him. I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life. We can't risk it. How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me! Man take it easy! You're sweating like crazy! It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is. Are you nuts? They'll fry us for sure. There's no way we're doin' that, you understand? No way. No we didn't. He died on his own. Well, we didn't know that at the time. I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?! We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway... I don't know... Fair enough, I'll take it to my place. Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own. I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out -- Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do. Okay then. I'll do it. Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway. I don't know... I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail. We can't risk it. How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me! I don't know! Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you? What are you gonna do? Well, we won't do any of that shit! What's that? We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else. Car went up in the gunfight. We'll torch the bases, how's that? All right we will. Maybe. Who cares? They killed themselves. Besides, they were breaking the law. What they were doing was wrong! Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles? That's right! It's no accident we stumbled on this money. It's an answer to a prayer! Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push. Tonight my prayer came true. Because...I know. I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen! Who's going to question us? Dwayne? Jesse? We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus! We'll figure something out. Why? Hell, it won't be us! Come on Booth! Look at these scumbags around us. Who's going to know what happened! Let's take it and get out of here! Robbed a bank, c'mon! Don't you think we would have heard if one, two -- shit I don't know how many were at large! Don't you think there would be a bulletin? This is a big ass drug deal! Look around you partner! You said yourself you never saw anything like it. Why? Are you kidding me? I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm -- What are we going to do? There must be over a million dollars in here. They're out of towners... Arizona plates... That's what everyone thinks. But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate. Oh, you would have done great. Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two... He would have won more but he blew it at the end. Didn't know what Cash and Carry was. Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher. He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars! Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that? His excuse was the government got it all. I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble. Thanks for the loan, man. I'll have it in a few days, I promise. How old is Otis anyhow, thirty? I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave. Ready to roll, partner? Hell, I don't know. If I had some input I'd offer it up. I don't know. What makes you say that? Why? Don't worry the real men are in charge now. Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man. Just have to...pick a discreet spot. We gotta, Jesse. It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice. We gotta know where the tapes are. I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is. We're gonna talk. You're never getting that much. Well you can't have it. Oh Jesus Christ... What do you mean? You gambled it? Well you're not getting, either. What? We're out of here. And if we refuse? Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that? Then what the hell are you all about? Absolutely positively. You've done without it long enough, ma. Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough. Besides, I want you to have it. Yeah. Figured you could have it. Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place. And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail. Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well... There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks... Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go... Hey -- I've got a surprise. At least around here it does. Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool. It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you. But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say. Well, same ol' same ol'. Yeah. I was in the neighborhood. Hi ma.OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!! TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!! HELLLLLP!!!! You're only screwing yourselves over! Helllllp! HELLLLLP! SOMEBODY!!! Come on, Booth. Don't let him do this!!! You better believe it if you know what's good for you! I was beginning to think you weren't going to show. That can't be all of it. I'm not gonna take -- I'm not gonna take it in stride. I had a good run turn to shit on me like that - cleaned me out. Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem. I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat! I want my share. All of it. There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement. By Friday. I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you? Ok...I'll wait. For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak. Well, I don't know... I'm all ears. Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80. You can buy 'em at any store. There's no way they can pin anything on me. My offer? Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends. All I want is my share, which I guess is... Listen Earl. I covered for you. For both of you. I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me! My point, well... You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies. Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all. No. Something wrong with you Dwayne? Well I'm here now. Yeah...see you at three. I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time. Uh, sure. I hear you. About what? Why? I'm at a payphone in Vegas. What's up? Yeah whaddya want?. Yeah. That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws. Sort of. Aw, now that�s gonna take time to clear! No. But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I�m a busy man. Very clumsy, very clumsy. I�d have found it in a minute. Damn it�s hot in here... I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won�t immediately look. Stop! Stop! I don't need the money. You can have it all. Don't hurt me. Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off! What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches -- I think I am. You want to see how more unglued I can get? Try me. So I want the money and I want it now. I was on a roll! I�m a little overextended now. Listen - I'm not asking. Just do it! Meet me there, now. Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner. Right behind you. True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl? I'll settle for a third of that. Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.It's odd. I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation. Denning was wearing a bug. Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next. Yes. Wife and a kid. Don't blame yourself, Deputy. You did all you could. You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks. Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago. Maybe. That's where it was during Denning's last report. Because someone may have gotten away. Thank you. Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from? Hello. Thanks for your time. Be more specific. A month, a week... Could it have been this? What did he buy? OK...this is good. Our first solid lead. Dwayne... It is imperative that we keep this confidential. Now we know someone's out there. Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner. Sheriff Hogan -- Well you can understand why we didn't say anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us. We don't know. Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system. Mm-hmm... Don't you have to be here? Oh that was Agent Wallace. We're going to check into something. Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously. Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it. Maybe. Maybe not. Uh, no... We appreciate that. Well nothing audible to us. Maybe the lab can pick something up. Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five. He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening. I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back. I wanted to ask you some questions about last night. Not getting an answer? For Christ's sake! Call 911! Let's get it locked down here! This isn't right... Yeah. We're going to find out. I knew it, I knew it all along - shit! No, it doesn't. Neither does his blank tape. Any news on that? So someone did get away. So...what's the good news? That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you? There was more than that. Anything in it? Give me the bad news.Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right? Not exactly. It's some lingerie store on the strip. Yeah. Some of it. Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills. Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop. Came through a store called After Midnight. There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them. I'm not getting an answer. What do you think? Heart attack? You think he skipped town? He didn't make it into work, and he's not home. We're doing a check on the manufacturers' serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch. What's your take on these local boys? Are they providing any answers? I don't know how else you'd explain it. The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense. That fire was set. Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene. Yeah, we did. It was unleaded, high octane. Not in the trunk. But nowhere near three million dollars worth. I would say maybe twenty thousand. Money. We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth. You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid... ...that hurts, son. Am I speaking English here? How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave? How about you give us what you have and leave. I have a better plan. I have a better plan. You want to hear it? You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you? Sounds like you don't trust me. Test the product?
