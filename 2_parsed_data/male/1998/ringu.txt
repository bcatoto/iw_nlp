There seems to be a popular rumor  going around about a �cursed�  videotape. Have you heard what kind of video  it might be? Let�s do it again. Have you heard what kind of video  it might be? Watching TV late at night... do you Izu? And, do you know if anyone�s really  died from watching it? What is it? They were in a wreck? Do you know the name of the high  school this girl went to? Hm? Thanks. But I wonder what this rumor�s all  about. Everyone you ask always  mentions �Izu.� Gifu, but there was some big  accident out there, and that ended up being what started the rumor. Mmm-hmm.  Something terrible like  that is going to stay in people�s  minds.  Sometimes the story of what  happened gets twisted around, and  ends up coming back as a rumor like  this one. That�s what they say, at  least. Maybe. Well, anyway, I�m off.  See you tomorrow. OK, Okazaki, I�m counting on you. Yessir. Miss Asakawa?  I thought you were  going home early today. Okazaki, can I ask you a favor? Sure. Could you check out this article  for me?  Get me some more info.? I guess... Good.  Call me as soon as you know  more, OK? Ma�am. Yoichi! Sorry I�m late.  Oh, you�ve already  changed. Yup.  I got your clothes out for you. Aargh, we�ve gotta hurry! Did grandpa call? Nope. Why did Tomo-chan die? * Well... it looks like she was really,  really sick. Will you do me up? You can die even if you�re young? If it�s something serious... well, yes. As hard as it is for us, what your  auntie and uncle are going through  right now is even harder, so let�s  not talk about this over there, OK? You and her used to play a lot  together, didn�t you? Dad. Ah! How is sis holding up? She�s resting inside right now.   She�s shaken up pretty badly, you  know.  It�s best she just take  things easy for a while. I�ll go check on auntie and them,  then. OK.  Ah, Yoichi.  Why don�t you sit  here for a little while? No, I... Well, they said there was no sign of  foul play. What are you doing up here?  You shouldn�t just walk into other  people�s rooms. You go on downstairs, OK? OK. You go on ahead. �K. Hello? Uh... this is Okazaki.  I�ve got  some more info on that article for you.  The girl was a student of  the uh, Seikei School for Women in  Yokahama City. Thanks. Excuse me.  This is, um, kind of a strange question, but by any chance  were you friends of that young girl that died in the car as well? Please.  If you know anything... Video? Tomoko-chan watched it, too?   Where? Cause of death? Drugs? Mmm-hmm. Yeah... Izu... Look, I�m probably going to be late coming home tonight, so just stick  your dinner in the microwave when  you�re ready to eat, OK? �K... Mom? Hmm? Tomo-chan watched some cursed video! What did you say?  You are not to  speak of this at school, do you  hear me? I won�t.  I�m going to school now. There�s no way... "My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.   That�s why I�m fat, too." Room for one? Um, actually I�m here on business. They would have stayed here on  August 29th, all four of them.   If there�s any information you  might have... Uh, hang on just a minute. August 29th... That... Hmm? That!  What tape is that? This?  Hmm... Maybe one of the guests left it behind� One week� Yoichi�s in elementary school  already, is he? His first year.  What about you,  Ryuji?  How have you been  recently? Same as always. And money is...? I�m teaching at university. Anyway.  You said that the phone rang? That�s right. So if I watch it too, that phone over  there-- --should ring. Ryuji, four people have already  died.  On the same day! Well, why don�t you try calling  an exorcist? Take my picture. Turn this way. Hurry up and take it. It�s over. Well, it looks like your phone�s not  ringing. Make me a copy of this, will you?   I�d like to do a little research of my own. There�s no reason to  write us off as dead just yet.  If there�s a video, that means that  somebody had to make it. There�s the guest list from the  cottage to look into... and the  possibility of someone hacking  into the local station�s broadcast  signals. Here�s that guest list you wanted. Oh, thanks. What are you gonna do with this? Uh... sorry, I�m working on  something personal. Hey. Nothing. So, what�d you come up with? I don�t think any of the guests on  the list brought the tape with them.   I couldn�t confirm it face-to-face  of course, but even over the phone I  got the feeling they were all being  upfront with me. There�re no traces of any illegal  television signals being broadcast  around Izu. Here�s that copy of the videotape  you wanted. Asakawa. Have you ever seen this woman? There�s something strange about  this shot. From this angle, the mirror should  be reflecting whoever�s filming. So, what does that mean? Well, if the person who made this  is a pro, there�d be a way around  that, I guess, but still... Volcanic eruption... Eruption where? This is gonna be impossible to figure  out on just a regular TV screen,  don�t you think? Come on in. Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai. This is Asakawa, my ex-wife. Asakawa. * What�re they talkin� to you  about it for? Ask them to wait another week. OK, OK. This is impossible. Sada... Is Yoichi gonna be all right? He�s used to it... Whoever made this had to have left  some kind of clue behind.  They�re  probably waiting for us to find it. Wait a minute. Shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou...   boooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu... Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru  zo.  Did you hear that, too? What does that mean? I�m gonna check it out. Hello? I�ve got it.  It�s a dialect, just  like I thought.  SHOUMON means  �playing in the water� and BOUKON But, dialect from where? Oshima.  And the site of our  �eruption� is Mt. Mihara. Yoichi?  I�m gonna be a little  late tonight, honey. You can do it yourself, right?  OK.   Sorry.  Bye. I�ve got it!  This old article... What are you doing? Has your newspaper got someone out  there at Oshima? I think so.  There should be a  correspondent out there. I need you to find out, and let me  know how to get hold of him. Tonight. What do you think you�re--? You�ve only got four days left,  Asakawa!  Your newspaper contact  and I can handle this from here  on out.  You just stay with Yoichi. Grandpa! Whoa, there!  So, you made it, huh? Yoichi says he�s looking forward to  doing some fishing with you. Is that so? C�mon grandpa, let�s go! OK, OK.  We�ll get our things  together and then we can go. There he is!  C�mon, there he is,  don�t let him go! Oh, oh!  Ah... guess he got away,  huh? That was your fault, grandpa. Well, whaddya say we try again? We�ll get �im this time. How was work, mommy? Hello? Yeah.  Your Oshima contact came  through.  It looks like the woman  who predicted the Mihara eruption  is the same woman from the video. Her name is Yamamura Shizuko.  She  committed suicide forty years ago  by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara. Have you got anything else? I�m gonna have to check it for  myself.  I�ll be leaving for  Oshima tomorrow morning. Oshima?  I�ve only got three days  left! I know.  And I�ve got four. I�ll be in touch. What�s happened? Nothing.  I just had some things  left over from work. Yoichi? Yoichi!  You brought this with you,  didn�t you?  Why?!? Tomo-chan... Tomo-chan told me to watch it. I should�ve been more careful.   When I was at your place that  day, I could feel something  there.  I thought it was just  because of the video... You mean that Tomoko� That�s not Tomoko.  Not anymore. Yoichi... he can see them too,  can�t he? It�s all my fault.  First Tomoko  died, then those three others.  It  should have stopped there, but it  didn�t.  Because of me. I wonder... How did the rumors about the  video even start in the first  place? This kind of thing... it doesn�t  start by one person telling a  story.  It�s more like everyone�s  fear just takes on a life of its  own. Fear... Or maybe it�s not fear at all.   Maybe it�s what we were  secretly hoping for all along. Mr. Hayatsu? Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit  suicide? She was taking a real beating  in the press, being called a  fraud and all sorts of names.   After a while she just lost it. Shizuko was getting a lot of  attention around the island after predicting the eruption of Mt.  Mihara.  Seems that for some time  she�d had a rather unique ability: precognition. It was around then that she attracted the attention  of a certain scholar whom you may  have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro. He was driven out of the university,  wasn�t he? This Professor Ikuma convinces  Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him,  where he uses her in a series of  demonstrations meant to prove the  existence of ESP.  At first she�s  the darling of the press, but the  next thing you know they�re  knocking her down, calling her a  fraud.  Hmph.  Forty years later, the media still hasn�t changed that much. I�ve heard this story.  But... I�m  sure I remember hearing that somebody  died at one of those demonstrations. After getting kicked out of  university, Ikuma just vanished,  and no one�s been able to get hold  of him since.  He�s probably not  even alive anymore. But, why even try looking for him? Because he�s supposed to have had a  child with Shizuko.  A daughter. Separate, please. Please!  If you could just answer  a few questions, about Shizuko... It�s about Shizuko�s daughter. She did have a daughter, didn�t she? Aren�t you gonna eat? Umm... Hm? You�ll stay with me won�t you?   When it�s time for me to die. Oh, stop it. You�ll stay, won�t you?  If you  stayed, maybe you�d learn something that could help Yoichi-- I said stop it!  Have you forgotten  There was a girl with Tomoko when  she died?  That girl�s now in a  mental institution.  Who knows what  could happen. But you could stay with me, Ryuji.   You�d be OK. Why, because I�m already not  right in the head? If that�s the case, why not just let things run its course, get rid of father -and- son?  Yoichi was a mistake, anyway. Stop it! We still have two days left... Come in. Is this Professor Ikuma? Shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo... What kind of a child was Shizuko? kuru zo.  �If you keep playing in the  water, the monster will come for you.� Shizuko could see �inside� people,  couldn�t she?  Down to the places  they�d most like to keep hidden.  It  must have been difficult for her... I�ve got a little of that ability  myself.  It was you who spread the  word about Shizuko, wasn�t it?   And you who first contacted  Professor Ikuma? You thought you�d be able to make  some money off her.  You even got  some, from one of the newspapers. Tell us about Shizuko�s daughter.   Who was she? She was there, with Shizuko. She  had to be. You were there! You stood there and watched the  demonstration. Match. Match. Faker!  This is nothing but trickery,  and the lowest form of trickery at  that. What are you trying to pull, woman? That�s right!  Professor Ikuma,  you�re being fooled! What�s happened? He�s dead! Witch! Sadako?! Sadako killed him?  She can kill  just with a thought? That�s right. After Yamamura Shizuko  committed suicide, Professor Ikuma took the daughter and ran.  No, no one knows where they went.  That�s why I  need -you- to find out where they are.   Even if the professor�s dead, Sadako  should still be in her forties.  I�ll  explain it all later, but right now  just hurry! Sadako�s probably already dead.  She could kill people with just a thought,  remember?  Her mother wasn�t even  close to that. Well, what about that video?  If  Sadako�s dead then who made it? Nobody made it. It wasn�t made at  all. That video... is the pure,  physical manifestation of Sadako�s  hatred. We�ve been cursed. What about the fishing boats?   Tell their captains I�ll pay. Fine!  I�ll try searching myself! Hello? Mrs. Asakawa?  I�m sorry.  I tried,  but I couldn�t come up with any  leads at all. Hello? Thank you... Yoichi... Izu... Ryuji! Ryuji!  The phone in my apartment  never rang!  It only ever rang at the rental cottage!  Professor  Ikuma must�ve... And we�ve got no way of going back. Please.  Take us out. It�s funny.  I�m not afraid at all. Sadako probably died back out there at Izu, before the rental cottages  were ever built. So, Sadako was Professor Ikuma�s  daughter? Ikuma smuggled her out in secret.   His relationship with Shizuko was  already a scandal, and one of the  reasons he got drummed out of the  university... We�ve gotta find  Sadako�s body. Is that going to break the curse?   Will Yoichi be all right? It�s all we�ve got left to try. Just one more day... We made it.  Maybe Sadako doesn�t  have it out for us after all. Hello? Yoichi?  It�s mommy.  I just called  to say I�ll be coming home tomorrow. I�m tired of it here, mom!  I wanna go back to school. Yoichi, it�s rude to your grandpa  to talk like that. He�s laughing.  You wanna talk to him? No, that�s... I�m sorry, Yoichi.  I�ll... I�ll  see you tomorrow. What�s wrong? Mommy�s got something she has to do.   Say hello to grandpa for me, OK? What time was it when you first  watched the video? Seven or eight minutes past  seven.  PM.  No more than ten  minutes past. If the rumors are true, that  time is gonna be our deadline. -Here-. I knew it!  The well. The well... Her own father! It was Ikuma who put this lid on.   And Sadako�s still inside. I�ll go. climb her way out. Lower the buckets! Take it up! Take it up! It�s already six! I know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!! Asakawa! What the hell are you doing?  Trying  to get me killed? Hey! Asakawa! We�ll change.  You�re in no condition  to keep this up. Who do you expect to pull up these  buckets, then? But, we don�t even know if it�s doing  any good... And what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his mother not coming to pick him up  after all? Don�t look down! Where are you?  Please, come out. Please.  Where are you? It�s you... Hey!  Asakawa!  It�s already 10  minutes past seven!  We did it! Why would Ikuma have killed her?   His own daughter... Maybe she wasn�t his daughter at all. What? Maybe her father... wasn�t even human. It�s gone... Enough, already.  It�s over.  C�mon.   I�ll take you home. Get some rest.   I still have a thesis to finish. ...thank you. That girl... Why?! That�s it!  Asakawa... Aaargh! Are you a resident here, ma�am? I�m Takayama Ryuji�s wife! I�m sorry ma�am, but they�ve already  taken the body away. What happened? Did he say anything to you?  About  a videotape? Ryuji... why?  Does this mean that Yoichi will die, too?  Is the curse  not broken yet? I was the only one to break  Sadako�s curse.  Ryuji... why...?   Something I did that you didn�t...   Something I did that you didn�t... Ryuji?! Something I did that you didn�t... What broke the curse was that I copied  the tape and showed it to someone else! It�s for Yoichi...
