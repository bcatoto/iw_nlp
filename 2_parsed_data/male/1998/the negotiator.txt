Omar, your wife's here. Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now. But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages. If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife. Don't give her the satisfaction. Your wife is on her way... Omar, listen to me-- She's coming, Omar, she's coming-- Omar-- Your Raoul? You hate Raoul? We got any shots? I will. Inside. There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate. I'm still on my honeymoon. Since when? That's not the play. Omar'll get a shot off. I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it. Negotiator entering Kill Zone. So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target. You'll get yourself killed. Just keep talking. How long's it been? Since you got married. You got someone else to think about now, Danny. Whoa. No way. You can't enter the kill zone. Nathan to HBT 1. Negotiator is requesting more time. Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around. Then I get my wife. Enough talking! We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man. My throat's fucking raw! I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck. No more goddamn talking! I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl! I want my wife. I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit-- Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore. You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife? Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out! Sometimes. And sometimes I don't-- Shut the fuck up! I fucking hate Raoul. Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
