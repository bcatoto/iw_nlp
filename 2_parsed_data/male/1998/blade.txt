Whistler, I -- No, we can treat the wounds -- Don't try to talk -- China Town. I need more serum. What's all this? Don't even start, old man. Get in. Youï¿½re leaving. It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her. Stupidity. Just do it, old man. She hasn't turned yet. You can help her. She's been bitten. Whistler! It's because I'm human that I can do this. You don't have a few minutes, Frost. Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought. Who dies first? Frost!!! You're not going anywhere. Pass. You're wrong. Maybe I don't see it that way. I don't buy it. How can you be out here? But I just got here -- How do I stop it? "The Blood Tide". Who is LaMagra? I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated. You're blind -- For them. But for me -- I can't -- I won't be able to stop -- No -- -- tearing me -- apart. You don't understand. The Thirst -- Get out of here -- What are you talking about? We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours. How long have we been driving? I've been better -- For what it's worth, I'm sorry. You don't look so good. Any progress? Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card. We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story. Cancer. For your miracle cure? Just get out of here. I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human. I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream. You get used to the darkness. Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute. Nothing that won't heal by dawn. You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown. Some kind of archive -- Like me. There are worse things than vampires out there. The way they move, they way they smell -- Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them. See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman. He will. Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver. You telling me you're ready to walk through that door? Look closer. What do you see here? There is no cure. It's war, now get the fuck out of the way! Preventive medicine. For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high. Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them. That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner -- This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now -- He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark? He didn't. Get over it. It worked, didn't it? Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up. Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint. Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that. I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business. Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us. -- he's a vampire. You shouldn't be here. Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives. Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it. I was in the neighborhood. How's it going, Kam? I don't believe that. You don't have to be. How could you be a part of this? Please -- Fight him -- But you -- died --Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here -- Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us? He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up -- That's weird -- Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac. No problem. This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear. It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask. What about the chemistry panel? Then what is it?You're too human, Blade. You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then. Take him. No longer. Watch me. You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter. The pause that refreshes -- Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron. Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you. The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete. Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been. Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses. It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker". I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things. Beautiful day, isn't it? How do you like that? Right on time. Perhaps. Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it. Which, of course, they do. Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans! When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge? Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for. Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose? The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him. You're wrong, Dragonetti. I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race. You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip. Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest. Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life. Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle. What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about. Who better to usher in the Blood Tide? LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself. That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better. Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free. The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it. A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.There's only one alternative to the serum. I was afraid that might happen. You're a week early.I know. Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right. Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back. Going somewhere? What took you so long? Wait. Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy. I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum -- You should've killed her, then. Are we bringing home strays now? I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in. Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins. How? Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin. I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this. Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I? I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live. Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by. Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in -- I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening -- Habit, mostly, just like this. Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience. The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control. The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure -- Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst. We weren't sure we could trust you. Go on, I'll be fine! You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come. We keep in radio contact. There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative. Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic. Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock -- My name is Abraham Whistler. This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here -- You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
