You're not. So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life? I don't know what that means.Be careful, Danny. Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone. When can you get it here? Who else have you told? You've got it on tape? Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so-- They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on-- Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking-- Tired of chasing squirrels around the park? Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?Yes. Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions. I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago. Why don't you just call Brill directly. A direct one. Tell us about Rachel Banks. It is? They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations. We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.Feeling lucky? C'mon. AmeriTech's data-base. There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got? Shit. What do you know about locking cellular phone signals? We'll have to re-stock some basics. How fast can you learn? You wanna get caught spying on Albert? Who? Reynolds. How? What if what ? They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes. If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays. Nah, they'd shut down the pin number. What if we transmitted it over cellular? I know. I know what they're looking for and I'm telling you. The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be looking for those moves. It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea? I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits. Same thing? Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get near the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years. Goddammit-- Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off. Drive. Drive. These guys are incredibly persistent. Yeah, I can see where that'd-- Fuckin-A. We lost 'em. Think we let out enough air? Those are Feds. You sure? They shouldn't have come without calling first. Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way. In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building. Here? Them. They're here. Well, actually, you have proof. Could you walk a little faster please. The NSA killed him. Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah? Yeah. Take a walk with me. That is one ugly sunrise. Welcome to Santa's Workshop. What do you think? Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again. It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to Ramparts and split. That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach. Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan every phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis. They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do. Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic. Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted. I intercepted phone calls. I was a traffic analyst. None of your business. The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it. The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world. At least it better be. Oh, I'll bet that threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice! You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last-- I told you no calls. What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? Jesus! I mean did you call anyone. Did you call anyone? The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here. I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'. I taped it off the 11 o'clock news. Move it. Get dressed. We're leaving. If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury. And take this. They froze your accounts. Get outa my way. And you won't. Now move-- Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even. Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed. No shit. Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it. They're spooks. Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow. If I knew, they'd be after me . Which they probably are right now. 'Bye. It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch. 230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks. Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz. It's a SAT-tracker. I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away. You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339? Okay. Yes. That's who they are. You've heard of the National Security Agency? One of many people who would live a word with you. You knew the deal. No contact. My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you. Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name-- Who's calling? Baudmore Consultants. Anytime. With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator... Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know... I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker. FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops. Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement. The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but-- Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say. Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff. A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.Who are you calling?! Someone else? Um...who's that? Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros. I just gave him my card. I'm telling you, I-- Nothing. Nothing. Yes. They said he was behind an extortion scheme. I don't know anything about Zavitz. Oh Jesus. It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone. Brill? I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape. Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good. It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator. Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol. Really? Told by whom? I don't know who he is. I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use. What kind of a question is that? Rachel Banks? Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family. Why? Not particularly, no. He came in four minutes ago. What are you dialing? I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that-- Pretty fast. We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know? No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert. No. Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us. What if we just fucked with 'em? What if-- What if-- What if-- Listen-- Well how do I know what they're-- What if we hand deliver to their homes or office? What if we do a mailing to Congressmen. So what do we do now? What about newspapers and magazines? We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you-- No he won't. Tell him we're not gonna hurt him. We're not gonna hurt you. Tell me about it. Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay? That wasn't so hard. Oh my God... I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant? You're driving. Gimme that. What the fuck?! Why? 'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please. Here ?! Where? Who? What's going on? Jesus. Do you have proof? Yeah. It really is. Did you find anything? Looks like Detroit. They come after you? Why'd you leave? Jesus. How'd you have the manpower to-- How'd you get around the tap orders? You used to work for 'em, didn't you? How do you know so much? I didn't use my name. Sorry. You told me no calls. I called from a payphone! I didn't use my name. I called my wife! Look, my wife is understandably-- What do you mean? One-twenty. We said a hundred. And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate-- You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it. How many years have you been hiding from them? How many years have you been running? What'd they do to you? I'll pay you. What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't. What if-- What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my life ?! I don't know anything . I don't know what that-- Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want? Wait. What do I do? Why are they after me ? I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. What is that? Yeah. Wait. You're crazy. The NSA? What do they have to do with this? Who are they? Who was that other guy? You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan. Dylan, I was just asking Eric if-- You got any money? Hello. Hello, Maria. Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel? Listen, Daniel, hang on one second. Okay. Thanks. Eight. Size eight. Pardon? I'll say. I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a little about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish. Is that good? Can you help me? Yes. I have her permission. I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present... I'm married. Because my life is being ruined. Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible. That's my point. I know, but-- I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, way outa line. You understand? Yes , for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these. To buy lingerie. No. Not that I could see. No, sir. No. I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work. Somebody took my blender. Than why don't you talk to the bus driver? Because I don't know. I'm not his attorney. I can't. What kind of trouble. I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused-- About what? I was in the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus. That's 'cause I wasn't there. A report? Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident. The robbery. Hey, did you guys find my stuff? Thanks. Who are you? Yes? A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now. Yeah. I wish you could've met... Albert's gonna get me my job back. It's over. That's gonna end tonight. Yeah. Oh Christ. ...who root through...uh...presents, and... You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through-- That was for Christmas. You opened the thing? That's okay. Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech. Stacy-- Well...yeah. I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things electronically . The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway. Please. I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay. I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you. Has anyone been by? Police? FBI? Is Eric in school? Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit-- It wasn't me. I know. No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now. I know, but listen-- Stacy-- Stacy, don't hang up. Stacy-- It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up. It's not real... That's not me. I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks. I see her for business. I know. I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator. Yeah...look-- I've seen it. It's not true. Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm hearing of-- Stacy? There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it. Well, you know-- It's okay. No. Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric. A guy named Brill. Same guy as always. What do you mean? Yeah. A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids. The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me... ...he was upset about something and he said... Doesn't matter now. I'm gonna wash up. In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back. I saw a man die. Something bad happened tonight. I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us. Right. Just for the criminals. Not a very good one, but-- Uh-oh. Hey. Don't count on it. My suitcase is gone. My suitcase-- Here, you can use this. It's a brand new card. Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one. That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't-- You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun. That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada. It's not? I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very-- I don't believe it is, no. Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers. I'll see if I can, you know, work things out. My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now. No, I meant I'm Presbyterian. Actually, that's not true. I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me. Any idea what he looks like? Yeah. It's not me? I'm sorry about that. What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life? I did care how. Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me-- You have to. Tell me about Brill. I'm gonna fix it. Rachel-- That's temporary. My firm'll represent you. Free of charge. You being audited? I know. Will you hang on just a second. Who's doing this? You got a minute? All right, look-- Why? Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg. Thank you. How can I be sure. I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law. I like our history. And I like you. I'd probably like Brill if I ever got to-- Why would I-- Other than Brill. Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission. So you've said. Brill? "Soon". Or at least sooner than never. That wasn't the answer I was hoping for. Brill. When do I get to meet him? Not that much. I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same. It tastes like fish. Fuck you. You may have to-- Otherwise you may have to what? He didn't give me-- Fuck you. You may have to what? Otherwise you may have to what? He didn't give me-- If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't. You're wrong. He didn't. I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could-- Who are you people? Yeah? You're Brill. I don't know you, I don't know your name, I don't know what the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' sick of this! Get it?! Hey! My shoe? Jesus! What?! You want money?! Fuck off. Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name. You're firing me. Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know. This is bullshit . Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case. Brill. Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel. Oh, well, that's true. I don't under-- Listen-- Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments. Thank you, sir. I have to go lingerie shopping. God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening. My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you. Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth. The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now. That's because your Union bosses are those Guido mother-fuckers. L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans. Good point. Why? What are you talking-- Where's Stacy? No "900" numbers. It's okay to use the phone. I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here. Did you take anything --anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week. Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready? No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes. Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon. Do I know you? Where's mom? You staying for dinner? In your dreams. Sure, go ahead. Some of 'em. You're learning a cruel lesson. Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big. Go fuck yourself. Jerry? Yeah? No. No, it's okay. So do I! Go to 'em, Jerry. To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal. I won't make it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go. No, I-- You gotta-- Jerry-- I don't know! I don't know. I mean-- They're framing me. My stuff's all over her apartment. Yes. They killed Rachel. The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed-- It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this. Ssh! Jerry-- I'm a labor lawyer. There are always mob ties. Into what? An investigation? It was a bus accident. I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen? Table 122? Serve the ball. What? No, but they took my blender. I love my blender. They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender. Why don't you give 'em a call. No. No. They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo. Yeah, what's going on? Are you okay? Tell me about it. I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little-- It's been a few years. It's me, Robert Dean. From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on-- Jesus! I just told you. I don't know. I don't know. I honestly don't know. He got hit by a bus. You remember Daniel Zavitz? The police? Why not? You would? Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir. Sir? Maybe it's not connected yet. I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.Oh, God, I knew it was stupid, I knew we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just sitting there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back. Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'? Is it okay? Hi, Mr. Dean.Alright! How long can you stay? Yeah. Who won the fight? Are you and mom getting a divorce? Where've you been? Dad! She's in the kitchen. He's kidding. Dad! Really? Can I open 'em up? Are those my Christmas presents? Hi, dad.Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, because of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible. Yes. But we can't. Well we'd sure like to help you. What is it you want?Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve. Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units. Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary. We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now. Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body. We don't know. If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources. If they've looked at the video. And they have the video. That's confirmed. No sir. Yes sir. Well...his real name's Edward Lyle. We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill. I just meant-- Sir-- He's clever. He had help. He had help. It was in his bag. Now it's not. He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying. We'd have to-- Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney. Mr. Reynolds? Sir? He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact. There was a transfer. We found the originals. He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.Yeah? Turn yourself in. Bobby? Piece of advice? I'm sorry, man. I have a family. Bobby, you're in way over your head. To the cops? You gotta let me bring you in to the police. No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in. Listen to me. You're tired. Why would the NSA-- Why would they-- Bobby-- Jesus. Rachel's dead? Calm down. Bobby-- Bobby-- Christ! Just be cool. Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties. He's heard that it's escalated. The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation. That's what I want to talk to you about? Can I talk to you a second? They only took electrical appliances. Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric? They didn't take the silverware? The blender? What about jewelry? Usually they take clothes. You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em? Did they take your clothes?You think there was a connection to-- Was Zavitz in trouble? What does that have to do with you? Yeah. No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan? Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.Seat 74. Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't ever mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it? Gimme the shoe. Your shoe. Shut the fuck up.The door was open, sir. I just need a signature. For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature. Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies. You have any idea what kind of position this-- The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?Yes sir. I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks. For your wife? Why'd you go to Harrison's? Nobody gave you anything ? Was he with anyone? Anything at all? Did he give you anything? We'd appreciate your cooperation. Why so edgy, Mr. Dean? I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident. Than why can't you tell me. Are you invoking attorney/client privilege. You tell me. Mr. Zavitz was in trouble. About the accident. Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something. You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before-- A police report. Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report. No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up. Your stuff? I'm sorry. Detective Morelos. I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.The thing is...it really can't wait. It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name. Is Jerry Delsano in?We'd rather not-- --otherwise we may have to-- We'd rather not-- --otherwise we may have to-- We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you-- We have good reason to believe that he passed you-- We believe he did. Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to-- I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security. We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.Get it. Then what's your goddam opinion? I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right? What's your opinion? There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!? Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum? What? It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and-- It means who's side are you on? "I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II. He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place. Kill him now. What's your ETA? Do you have visual? And if it wasn't? What about the tape? Explain that. What about-- Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god dammit , Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now! Oh, let's assume that they have. So they know everything. Dean's with Lyle. You're kidding me. Lyle?! We believe? I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his lap . I want the tape and I want him. Now is-- No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland. He's clever? He had help? Oh. I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i> fucking</i> <i> phonebook</i> ?! Help from whom? Christ. 30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there? Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks. Hiding something? Get it. Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him now . Who? Am I to understand-- The originals? What about the tapes? What happened? Now is that clear? Then let's assume I don't. Do I look like I want a tiny pizza? No thank you. Yes?And then what? Oh. You didn't squeeze DePinto? I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' what ?Neil, thank you for your help. With what? Oh my God. Are you sure about this? Law enforcement? What are you saying? What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment. Well then who can? --Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep. He's carrying the damn flag . This guy's carrying the flag for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off? We're not stupid, Reynolds.Bobby-- A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out. Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence. Who would do that? Gentlemen-- What's his name? Robert-- They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case. I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation. Merry Christmas, son. And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?Yes sir. Yes sir. No. I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with-- Puffed cheese?
