If I did-I don't-now. I think you mean that. Me? This is it, Betty. They'll find us again, fog or no fog. Shut up! Cut it out! Even if I have to kill both of us-- Would I want to? You think Magruder wants to hang beside me? Who'd believe it but you? I took him out to sea and threw him in the water. Even if they find him, what connects him with me? Mitchell was dead enough. Mine? It wasn't the time or place. Don't worry about the note, baby. I'm playing for my neck now. I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since. Don't go soft on me, baby. I've got your note in my pocket. You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it. It has to be found in exactly the right place. Magruder obliged me. No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up. I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore. Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing. Not this one. And not Mitchell. No. I paid him off. It buys things, just like any other kind. Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father. I thought it was a legitimate business. He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies. I never saw the pies. They had names. For the record. Innocent names. You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you? So could you. But our records were a little against us. In a way. I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune. Most of it pretty dirty money. I don't care to have that known. Including Killaine. That's right. That, and the fun of it. Wonder what? Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink. Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now. Cold? There would be a moon tonight. See anything? Killaine's wise. We can't wait any longer. Here, put this on. But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor. I'll tell you when. Well? My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am. I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail. It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so. It did, but it never paid off-- until now. I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway. You'll be safe here. I won't be long. Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there. You can make coffee if you like. The best interference runner we've got. He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman. Come here, baby. If they had any reason to. Why make it tough for themselves? Why go to all that trouble? Here's an open book. Close it. No reason to keep it open. She was a nice girl, anyway. And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose. Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know. Give her the benefit of the doubt. Leave her stay where she is. Close the book. Finis. Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere. Of course she might have run away--if she knew how. And where to go. She might have dyed her hair. Bleached it before probably. And changed her name again. But look at this note. And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there. Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that. Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance. I run over to Victoria. Play some golf with some people I know. Do it all the time. That's why I have a cabin cruiser. Custom- built.Forty knots. Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure. Member of six golf clubs. Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course. You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie. Came alone? Sure. He always comes alone. Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man. This is the ace, Betty. But not of spades. They'll find out about the other. They might know already. And when they get this-- What would they look for? Where? Out there somewhere? How bad is the other thing? The secret? How bad is it? Bad enough for-- There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note. After you're gone where would they look for you? Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser. And I have a pocket full of money. And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me. If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty. Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine? I know. Killaine has a warrant. No percentage in that. You're probably mistaken about that. Let's get together sand talk it over. There's always a solution to these problems. But it must be near the water. Quite near-- Yes, if you don't mind waiting. Cant be too close for me. Right across the street from it suits me. Anything else listed? I don't think that's on the market anymore. I'd like something much closer to the water. It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact? From you, I like it. That's the second round I've lost tonight. That fellow hurt me. No use waiting, then. It still doesn't matter if I kiss you? Try not talking. Anything I can do about it? Why? Us? He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me. He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it. We'll find out. Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby? Couldn't be. Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no. I didn't notice him. I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it. Why not? Want to dance? At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks. Cold? I'm different. I like it fine. Just who are you, anyway? Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us. So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance. Quarter after one. Why? He could hardly help suspecting you. Bad? You didn't have to tell him that. Want a spike in it? It's always a mistake to run away. Always. You tried to run away. I'd rather wait until it does matter. He was a great boy for that. What else? Nice of him. How did you meet him? They'll know whether he killed himself. Sure... but somebody always does.. He got in here how? What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells. Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy. I know it's a littler late for an apology. Dance? He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor. Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good. Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it. I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone. Whatever you say. I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself. No. Are you really going to drink that stuff? I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests. Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you? No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But.. If you really want a good dry Martini.. Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb. It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome. It might be worth a Martini to you. A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored. Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one. Sit down then. We often have a double up here. You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time. This way. Who's Goble? All right. Get him. Morning. Any calls? I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's. There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night Got the information on you? A thousand. You mentioned information. For two hundred? For five hundred, what do I get? If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign. I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose. That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck? What have you got on Miss Mayfield? What are your rates? Private eye? Name it. I'm still asking. What do you want? Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning. I'm not interested in blind dates. Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him. Leave that one lay. Sometimes. You, Killaine? What'll you have, Margo? Let me introduce you. Mr. Killaine, Mrs. West. Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together? I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you. How are your teeth getting along? Who told you my name? So you're not a cop. All right, let's see the buzzer. You asked me where it all came from. I had a father who knew how to steal. I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately. Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of it. Wait a minute. I'll go with you. You forgetting the gag line, Killaine. The police don't take anything for granted. Where would she go, anyway. Don't tell me you haven't got her covered. No idea. Romeo in reverse. Uh-uh. No sale, Killaine. Mitchell was too drunk. How could Mitchell? After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in? And old man Clarendon? He had a motive, too. Margo and her money. Your concentrating too hard, Killaine. What about Margo West? She had a motive. I guess you know by this time whose gun it was? That COULD BE TOLD. Don't kid me. You don't think she murdered Mitchell. You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her. What toughened you up? Doesn't answer the question. Would that make me a heel? That must hurt. A couple of hours. Could we discuss that some other time? I wouldn't know. I never notice the view after the first week. If it doesn't take too long. Drink? Well--good night. In case you want to have us followed. How are you two getting along? How about a cup of coffee? Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure. No. Could be. On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better. Yes, I've seen it before. That's what I thought, at first. Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party. With my liquor of course. Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name. Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down? Round of golf Saturday? How's life treating you? You're not English. What? Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric. Want to walk out... or get thrown out? I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners. Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench. Lay off, can't you? Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell. Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell.He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why. With what motive? How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear. Convenient, isn't it? So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have. I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious. I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again. Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun. And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him. Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"? They always have another. See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys. I don't think you locked your door. So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair. I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again. Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night. No, Not recently. I'm sure of that. I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..Magruder's conked out. Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent. He may come out of it and he may not. As a source of quick information, we can't forget him. Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco? How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector. If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections. Send that? I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business. Greer won't give out. If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea-- We've done that. He's a San Francisco private eye. Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E. Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it. Goble and Greer is the firm name. You told me when we'd identified this fellow-- Got a moment, Inspector? I'm an Irishman, sir. An Irishman is always logical. I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years. This man hadn't been dead an hour. He wasn't killed last night. He was killed today. In broad daylight. That's no drunk- rolling job. You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets. Not a floater. Only just dead. The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare. Why not here? Get it in half an hour. Got it on you? Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it. I stick around and wait for the five hundred. I go home and paint the kitchen. Bluff. You've waited too long. You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand. Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic. Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon. $40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer. You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding. Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio. That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work. Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long? I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me. You asked for it. I'd like a few words with you, in private. Open it and count it. You get it's brother. One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed. Not too fat- not too thin. It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet. I have an appointment with him, right here, right now. I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco. Just like you thought...Two murders in two days. Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number. You win, Inspector. You win all along the line. Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us. Yeah. Of course you did. When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake. No suicide. And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out. How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it. I've got to find a way to handle it, openly. Like Brandon. I've handled it. Mitchell's handed it. If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide. If I leave it here....no suicide. This is the shell. What about the gun? Pretty big chance, huh? Do I know that she's out of the room? Likely to be out of it for some time? Do I know who lives down there? Such as? Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people. I'd want to know just about everything about them. If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters. Should be over there. I think so. Maybe we've been pretty dumb-- That's pretty risky business, Inspector. Gigi, huh? Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies. Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold. I guess I'm just ballast around here. She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night. Anything special you're looking for, Inspector? Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector. Unless the gun was slanted up. This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall. Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there. It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him. I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun. ... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector. They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl... Right. You in charge here?What's this in favor of? The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble. I've got good ears. Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon? What's a buzzer?Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time. I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield. Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank. Good morning. Can I do something for you?What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed? Just drunk enough. Maybe you're going to have to like me. How careful should I be? Why certainly, baby. Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield. If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz. Okay. You win. Don't I even get my face slapped? The brush-off, huh? Nobody I'd rather have on a leash. Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go. Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock? A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there. We have some nice places around Vancouver. What's the matter? Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away. Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know. How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side. I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all. I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector. A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something. Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you? No thanks? Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too. You don't know. Indefinitely? A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for? I'll make one for you. I live there. Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know. Or Reno? They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard. Vancouver, B.C. You could tell me your name. And where you're going. Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type. My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver. You don't throw guests out, Brandon. How would you know, Brandon? Did I do something wrong? Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby? What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore? The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have. Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies. I'm afraid this is all for the moment. A little something on account perhaps? Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell. Unsophisticated? If I knew about this babe... I say YES! In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there. Be nasty. I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you. Right. I told you she's just.. Of course. I didn't mean it that way I'm sorry. It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this. How long have you had it? What's this? That's not very kind. It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill. I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be. What'll we do about it, Margo? Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me. I have a rough idea. I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky. I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor. Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why? Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way. You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly. She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you? Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield. So-so. I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.Possibly, Miss. Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry. Otherwise they might think... Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer... I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane. Good evening, Miss.Brandon handled the money envelope. This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon? You'll have to take my word for it. We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison. Mayfield? She fit into this? So far. He checks too. No doubt about that one. Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women. I've made slides for two. They handled both envelopes. Yes, I think so. Here are two glazed manila envelopes. One is the bag type. The other one had the money in it. Don't ask me how I know. I know.Right, Miss. Beer or ale, Miss? Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law. Yes, Miss.
