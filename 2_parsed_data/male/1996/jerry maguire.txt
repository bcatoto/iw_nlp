Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy? Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz. Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered. Reporters, Jerry. They been callin' all night. "Something in the way. Yeah." "It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings... I see what you're saying.Ten seconds, Rod. It's only a half-hour show, Rod. -- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars. Playing in the state where you grew up.You know I didn't ever want to hurt you. No. I'm not trying to make history. _ 67. Listen to me, it's over. There is something missing here. It's over -- Listen to me! -- stop -- I think you added the "brutal." Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty.. Go ahead. Jump right on into my nightmare. The water's warm. _ 65. Look, I don't want a -- Everything's on the fucking run! Everything -- Could you just stop moving? What do I do? How do I spin this? This can't be happening to me. It's a plan -- -- _ 51. Well, no you didn't -- I know. Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there -- Now. Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?" Okay, this is working. That's right. I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time. Seventy-two clients. ONE stayed. Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44. "Dad says we gwan sleep on it. The power move is to go unannounced. Black suit, right? One of the accountants. I know about the bachelor party. You know. I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything! Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop. Just be friendly and say "no comment." Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario. It's big. Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make. Wait. What do you mean? Let me think about that. Want something to drink? Airight. Enough. I'm pulling him out of this. This isn't what I had in mind anyway. Bill, Rod, wait -- ... this is... uh... too funny... You're imagining it. Oh come on -- This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room. Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you. I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you. I missed my wife. We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh -- I love you. You complete me. So this break... is a break-up. What about Ray? I don't like to give up. What if it's true? "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on. It's the theme of my bachelor film -- Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way? ...my soul or something. _ 117. You want... Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run. I stick. Tell me -- let me help -- What -- Why do you love me? Well, when you wonder, ask me. I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible. Will you marry me? If I said that, would you stay? What -- So I'll see you this weekend. Sure you're okay to drive this? And I appreciate that impulse. Another time, okay Dorothy? Easy, easy -- Oh hell yes. Right. I'll come in. Same to you. Well -- this would be goodnight. What? No no no. I just underestimated her... her temper, I guess. Why are we even talking about this? It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it -- Bye you guys. _ 88. Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were... Wow. That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie. You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that. I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk -- -- but we have a company here to think about. I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again. We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere. Look, the other night, I want to apologize. I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and -- Good. Good. Glad is good. Happy. He said "happy?" Well, good evening. No, I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas. I'm like... harrassing you... right now. Now I feel like Clarence Thomas. Oh shit. You said "boss." Sorry about this hand. You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment? Mission... statement... Me too. Sure. And I am... We will be fine! Good idea. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. Do you have something to drink? And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted. Better now than later. We'll still be friends. I'm dying here. Yeah. That too. I broke up with Avery. I'm glad you're home. That "alone" thing is... not my specialty... Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy? Hi. Yep. Have a good time at school, Ray. Wish me luck. Thanks. Happy for us. It's all going to work. We're going to save the world. It's all going to work. Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back. I re-signed Cush. We're set. Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery -- No, that's fine. What calls came in today? Hello? Same to you. But I mean really... wonderfully... great. Give me your number. I'll call tomorrow. I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now. But it's going to be great. Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know. Wonder what he said. Dorothy. Ray. A pleasure. I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and... You think so? No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it. I already had my bachelor party. It was called "my twenties." See you later. No no. I knew. Well, take care. Now what did you lose? I know who y6u are. You're Dorothy Boyd. You're in... wait... you're in Accounts. You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body. Can I help? No no... Now. Wait. You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign. Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing -- I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door. So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back? Said who? Sugar? Do I know everything there is to know here? You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you? Denver got very silent about a day ago. San Diego's got a fever for Cush. This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft. People get crazy. And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight. Million. I'll give it everything. It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him. You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go. Oh, thank you. Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI. But to me -- I missed ya. What can I say? Go. Flee. We still having dinner in L.A.? Fine. Airight. Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player. You play with your head. Not your heart. In your personal life? Heart. But when you get on the field -- _ 113. Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on -- Look. I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you. Are we really "friends?" Damn right. No, I'm going to answer you. You want an answer? I'll give it to you. Loyalty. She was loyal. Everything grew from there. You're jabbing at me. _ 112. Not everyone has what you have. No, you're -- Why are you doing this to me, Rod? I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer? What's that supposed to mean? Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster. Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan. We can still take the offer, Rod. I'm a little worried -- No. I didn't "shoplift the pooty." We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who -- Alright, I shoplifted the pooty. The kid is amazing. But I sure don't like that she's leaving. No, I don't know. How do I know? Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego. What do you know about dating a single mother? Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career? Rod, get on the camel. I'll get you some quick work -- It's a risk. If you get injured, you get nothing. I'm out here for you! You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you. Forget it. Forget it. Fine. Rod, I'm not a rascist. I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid. It wasn't just about the money, was it? No, I'm saying to be -- You. Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and -- Great word. Towel? But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82. That's your word? I understand your anxiety. Uh, not today, but -- Oh my God. Another drink please. Why not? It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69. The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic -- See this jacket I'm wearing? You like it? I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom! Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale! What are you doing with me, Rod? Rod -- Very much. Call me tomorrow. Get some sleep. See you tomorrow. I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money." I gotta get back to Cushman. Yeah. And it might have even worked too. At last I find you. Show. Me. The. Money. I got it. Yes. Mmm. Hmm. Now you want Arizona dollars. Okay. Which they do. And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew. So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies. We're getting married in February. But wait... Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet. And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know. And I decide I'm not going to propose. The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't. And she knows I know. So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that. We fly to Honolulu in silence. We check into the Pro Bowl hotel -- To the pools. Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz." Exactly. And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there. A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months. Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months. It's like --ka- boom. The curse of 18 months. --so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui... She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now... I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet. I think you'll know when you see him at the gate. Well. Good luck with that -- Jerry Maguire. SMI. Where'd you find the perfect white shirt? I have to ask. Alright, I'm freaking too. But they need you to stay calm. I'll call back. _ 124. Keep the phone open. I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there. He took a shot. He's unconscious. Don't be silly. Marcee -- Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem. I'll go back to them. Damn right. Marcee, things are changing around here. You and Rod will have my total personal attention. Not a chance. How can I make your life better? Marcee. How's my favorite player's wife? SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be? You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone. You'd be my only client on that team... -- and I'll get 'em. I'm over it. Now I want all my clients and yours too. You'll lose. Dick. You... Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene... Pardon me? I'm fine. What's up? Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet... Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock. Dooler, you know Bob Sugar. It's in a cage. Do not be scared of... -- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo. Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of... Right up ahead, buddy -- A lot. We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy. Funny. We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands. Yeah I know. I did. Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed. Okay. I've been hogging it. You're right. _ 76. Wait. I want to tell you more about my dad. Hi Ray. They do, my brother. Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars? Thanks. May I offer you both a ride?We signed an hour ago. You were in the lobby with the black fella. I'm sorry, I -- Hey, I'm learning as I go. Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you. Not right now, Jerry. What happened to Denver? You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak. Denver is where he should be. I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play. Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him. We decided to stay with you.I'm scared. What is it? Show me the animal, Jerry! What's going on, Jerry? Funny... I better go to bed. I don't see any. I won't tell. You said "fuck". Let's go right now. Let's go to the zoo. Let's go the zoo. And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo? Hi. I'm not your brother! No. One-two-three, swing.I've got the clients. I've got the juice. You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always. We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters -- Jerry -- You wanted smaller. Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face! What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor! Can you get past yourself for a second? ... dick? You did this to yourself. You said "fewer clients." You put it all on paper. Scully was very upset. Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him. You did this to yourself -- I know. It sucks. I suck. Came here to fire you, Jerry. I came here to let you go. _ 27. You okay? Pleasure. Cronin's okay for lunch? The best commercial director in the business. I hail you.I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth. He should have kept his head tucked down. What'd I say? He's gonna have nothing left for next season. They're letting him kill himself. That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too. That about says it... Oh yes. Jerry Maguire! My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan. I... I love everybody, man. I love my wife. My kids. Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee. My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out? No, Roy. I'm not gonna cry. Thanks for coming. Jerry! You made it -- Only 'cause my wife likes your wife! Beautiful. I don't want to be friends anymore. I think so. Why not -- For loyalty, you buy a dog. For love, you get married. That's an answer. I'm sorry I asked. Then why'd you get married? I'm asking you as a friend. I'm trying to talk to you. How's your marriage? I'm asking you a question -- You don't want to go home, do you? Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone. Don't I know. Now go home to your wife. I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers. Hey, that's my word, okay? No. I'm worried too. I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago. Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on. Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man. He's gonna get me killed. Well, this was another way to go. You never had The Talk, did you? Shame on you. SHAME on you. No. A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom. Well, that ain't fair to her. A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103. Then you gotta have The Talk. You know when you know. It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know? First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her? Oh I know plenty. I was raised by a single mother. Oh, we gonna be friends now? Dude, know your art form. If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful. There's no need for a camel... you got ME. Good deal, man. Won't happen. I'm strong in my mind. You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude. And I dig that about you. No tell me. _ 84. What's wrong. Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance. "Love me love me love me... put me on t.v." That's the iconography of rascism, man! You're telling me to dance. Is that your porty or mine? No, I air-dry. I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan. Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package. The kwan. -- the kwan. Maybe you don't. Because it's not just the money I deserve. It's not just the "coin." It's the... John Taylor. J.J. Stokes. Andre Rison. I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table. Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?" Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money. Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops! My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years. What's my family gonna live on? What you get me. So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya." You are not allowed to act this way. No. Well, boo-fucking-hoo. Huh? You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow! You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother? You love me now, don't you? I might call you later! Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake? I'm a very good singer, man -- Good. I was just testing ya. But just you saying that? Makes me love ya. You're loving me now, aren't ya? Okay, I understand. I'll boil it down for ya. Fuck Nike. All they do is ignore me... You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there? Did I ever tell you my Nike story? Let's do it again. I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby? Why the fuck am I here? I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom. Congratulations. You're still my agent. Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it? Say it with me. Here it is. "Show me the money." Show. Me. The. Money. _ 36. It's a very personal, very important thing. It's a family motto. So I want to share it with you. You ready? -- now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening? Exactly. And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look! And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water. Say hello to Jerry Maguire -- Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity. I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby. Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS. Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!! Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
