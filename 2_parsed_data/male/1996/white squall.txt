Give me some time to Blow the man down! Weight! Hey! Blow the man down... Give me some time to blow the man down... Hey! Weigh! Blow the man down...Yes sir. Everybody down! ON THE DOUBLE!! We've got weather moving in from the west. Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side. I didn't know sir. Raise the inner jib! Raise the forestaysail! Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet. Rick, get on the jib sheet. George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse. George will show you what to do. Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward. Yes, Sir. Fifteen. My instinct was to not get electrocuted. Skipper called us out of the rigging. What do you mean? It was an act of God for Christ's sake. You came back, Tod. You came back. Okay, here's the duty. Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint. Corry and Stricklin have the brass. Robinson, you're the Galley slave. March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.No, I can't. All right. I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes... Why don't you go and try some of that on? I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch. That sound good? I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe. Make us proud.When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay. But you can't make this okay, can you? Fine. Okay. Yeah, sure. Where's Mom? Yes sir. What the "Bowsprit Affair"? Whatever. Gieg, Chuck. Yeah. I feel like... we can do anything. You know, I never had friends like this. Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here. I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life. It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out. Anonymous. That we're going back. I don't want it to end. I don't want to be what I was when I left. Feels different doesn't it? Yes you could. You did. This is all you. Nobody else. This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again. When you stand up and are counted. You know? Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?! It's a ninety-one! It's an 'A'! What about you? Ninety-six. You okay? Her name. Bregitta. It's poetry. Bregitta. Do you believe it? Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades. We'll start a private study group. Nobody knows. You'll ace that test. You're not a moron. What? If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right. Where you going? Yeah. So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop. No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath. I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in. What do you mean? He does. I'm just not like you. Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale. I'm never going to be "William". Because it looks good. That's not why he's sending me. It's not a vacation, it's private school. I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve. You weren't there, you don't know what happened. Is it true Phil? Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father. Because of you. Can we talk? You only hurt yourself you know? Why'd you do it? Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move? Shut up, Phil. It was a bad dream... But that's not the point... You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything. We all have problems. Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know? Bein' here together an all... Goodbye Mom. I'll be okay. Look, I just better go. Yes. Me too. No, I didn't. What are you talking about. What are they doing? Jesus, you never told them? Who? Swear to God. Only good advice he ever gave me. Now, go back to sleep. My dad. Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up! You'll be out of it. You'll wake up. Depths of hell... Ohio. How 'bout you? How do you know? They might. I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away. My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?" No way! That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it. Who wants to know? Do what? It doesn't matter. Really. I'm just sorry you got chewed out. I'm used to spending a lot of time alone. I guess that's what I thought it would be out here. But, it's not is it? I feel like I got you into this. I just brought you something to eat. Good. How ya doing? Jesus. Maybe it's an air raid. I don't know. They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same. I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is. What right did then have to show up here? It's his father sir. He's suffocating him. We've all seen it... Of what? He killed the dolphin. Sir...? The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance. I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir. Shouldn't we turn away? Would you, um, say it's a big storm? Face what? It was my fault. I slipped. Yes, sir. Northeast sir! Ah... Northeast... sir. Yes sir.That is unfortunate. We'll have to take him with us. Stow away? But you invited is aboard. Chicken is a fool's game captain.So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake? Then what do you think he was trying to do. Is that what you were trained to do? But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard. Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony. Well, you never can tell these days, can you? Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece. He's a big boy. Take good care of my son. I'll be frank with you. This was his mother's idea. A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me. And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here. Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind. Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October. I'm Francis Boutillier. This is my son, Philip. Albatross? Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. Who is it Philip? Well, what does it have to do with? Us? Listen to me, you thankless little prick. We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat... Oh, really? Spying?! Humor me. Eat it anyway. What's wrong, you don't like steak?They think we're carrying Cuban refugees. Skipper, they mean to board us. Jesus. She's got guns. What's that? And being sixteen. Immortality. What's that? Son-of-a-bitch. I'm sorry, Skip. It's this damned book. Lawford gave it to me. What?! What's happening?!! Yes sir. Yes. I do. I think you were too hard on Weathers.Me either. I'll tell you who you are. You're the glue. You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't. It's a gift. Figured what out? What was that? What? I couldn't have done it without you. I just can't believe it. I know. Congratulations. Yeah. How'd you do. Believe what? They were gonna put me into special- ed this year. I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding. I'll never pass the boards. Wanna bet? Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about. You know why it takes me so long to write papers? because I can't spell. While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary. I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut. I'm a moron, okay? You satisfied?! I cheated to get on the boat!!! All right?! You've gotta be kidding. Get the fuck outta my way! Yeah, that's right. You wanna come in and shake it for me? To take a piss. My old man split along time ago. It doesn't mean anything. You just take care of number one that's all that matters. That's what they get for not locking the door. I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty. She isn't that old. Jesus! What the hell happened to him. Why would you do that? Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule. We'll think of something. That's enough. Will you shut up? You sound like my fucking sister. I don't have to listen to this. Okay donut. Whatever you say. They tell you that? Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair. On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down. Trust me donut. I know. Like you'd know what to do with one. Shut up donut. Don't ever call me stupid. Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know. Because I felt like it. What do you care? What's your problem? Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford. What? What is it... the secret? Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne. Look, save it for somebody else will ya. This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me. I don't.Read on, young John. Read on. College boards are coming. The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall. If it were only that simple, my young friend. Read on, gentlemen. Read on. This isn't just a story!! It's history made allegory. It is a philosophical handbook for life! It holds the secret of this very voyage. You know what he is talking about here? That's not a satisfactory answer. You will if you wanna eat. Right George? If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress. Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him... We've got a problem. What do you think? Tie it off!! It seems we're short on singers. Well, that was neighborly.I know enough. I gotta go. Well that's just typical isn't it? I guess. Like you really care. Like any of you give a shit what happens to me. What's the difference? Like this! God damn it man. I think he broke my nose! Hey, shut up will ya? It's okay. I'll be in, in a minute. Look, what do you want? No. Look, it's me okay? Can't it just be about me? For once? It has nothing to do with him. Look, you put me on this boat in the first place. I didn't want to come but I did. Why do you have to embarrass me. Why can't you just leave me alone? I can take care of myself. Why are you here? I should be eating with the crew. Lemme go! Lemme go!! Me, too. I can show you how to use a slide rule. Oh, praise the lord. Relax everybody. Everything is under control. The jug head's going to think of something. How the hell are we gonna get outta here? Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't. Oh Jesus, oh Jesus. Man I knew we shouldn't have gone. I tried to tell you. I tried to tell you. You guys made me come! You made me come!! About anything. It hurts too much to care. Fuck off man. It's just a fish. They're waving... handkerchiefs or something. You gotta be kidding? He's a human chum line! Son of a bitch!! It's outta here! Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe... Fandango, Junior. I'm gonna do some limbo baby!! There are some things that everybody does in the same language. You've gotta be kidding? Long enough. I'm not gonna kill it. Joy, rapture... I'm not staying out here. No, sir. No. Suicidal... Sir.She said "None the better, you all go to hell..." So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale... A pretty young maiden she happened my way... Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day... Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit. Look, meet us out front when you're through. If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat. Rick March. Who the hell are you? Albatross? About yourself? You're the one who doesn't care, Phil. No, Phil. It's a mammal. What? No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.I can't go in there. I can't make it out? I couldn't. My brother. He fell out of the old beech tree. Broke his neck. I was on a camp out. They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down... They didn't find him 'till the next morning. They didn't even know why he was up there. That's how he died you know. It works? Who told you that? It was so real... Kennet Square, PA. 'Mushroom capital of the world'. Where are you from any way? 'Cause they're getting a divorce. That's why they sent me here. My sister's at Tabor. They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business. My parents don't do it anymore. What'd you do? So... What happened? Come on man, what'd they look like? Ya know... "It". You think Skipper and Alice do it? I'm sorry I left you hanging up there. Forget it. Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself. Fine. I can't watch this. What the hell is going on? Why, man? It matters to me. I figured it out. I've seen 'em. I've seen 'em. What? Come on... How would you know? If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her. I'll read it. I mean I don't mind. Come on, he didn't mean anything. I couldn't do it. Why'd you jump? I don't know. We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this. Come on man. Let's just talk about it. No way Phil. Not like this. Phil. What are you doing? But, they don't speak English. What are we supposed to talk about? How long you been standing there? I hate you, you son of a bitch!!! Aaauuuhhh!!! I can't. I don't know... I'm sorry... What?Thank you. How old are you, son? But your instinct was to lose sail? Why didn't you drop any sail? Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket? Lost everyone on board. In fair weather no less. Do you think this is funny? Some kind of joke? You lost six people out there. ... and that you invited him to strike you? To fight it out on the deck of your ship?! Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier... Except, a "White Squall". With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys... You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions. What makes you so sure it was one? Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew. Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall. Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.Claiming their place in the world. Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences. It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them. Phil, he's not looking inside. He's just striking out at the world. Because we believed we could make an impact out here. Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing. Why did we begin this? I can take it. Guilty. He never would have believed a woman like you existed. You sound so sure. I'd have liked to have said goodbye. All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands. He would have loved this. Yep. It's time these boys saw some real blue water. Did we lose anybody? North, north-east. And Dick, please make a note of our final position. Carry on. Everyone out of the rigging NOW! Well, that's all part of it. Come in. It's your job to know. If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not. Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill? Watch the tell-tales Chuck. If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water. We'll bear off to port and run down wind. Good. Let's go sailing. Everyone aboard young Bill? You should tell him. That's something he can take with him. Does Phil know how you guys feel? They have every right Chuck. Of a fight he can't win out here. The Dolphin was a symptom. Why do you think I'm sending him home? Close the door. Sit down. Can't do it. Well, spit it out. What's on your mind? You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall. Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight. Sometimes it gets exciting out here. Uh, huh. Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it. You all right? All stop on the engine. Unfurl the squares! Speak up boy! Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out. I want to know that you've heard and understand. Raise the mainsail. Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west. He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama. Your cannons made a compelling argument. So is violating international law. What is it we can do for you today? And, of course, we are. We'll do our best. You're welcome to say goodbye. It will be more than that, I can promise you. Happily, it all worked out... This time. Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk. This is a working ship. Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her. Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed. As you can see, there's a lot to do. I know. Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen. It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on. It's very bad luck if you kill one. And dolphins too. Not a chance. Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war. She's Cuban. They'll know about it in the morning. They're in a hurry to grow up. They don't know about consequences or responsibility. That's being sixteen too. I promise you one thing... Spirits have a way of bringing that out. A padlock. I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be... We're short one long boat too. Come on. You're officer of the watch, George. You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing. It's all my responsibility. So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley. We'll get along that way. I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours. We've got to bring them together. Make them a crew. We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way. So, I will challenge them and they will come together. You do? Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere. No. Bring him on deck with the others. What's that? Barometer's dropping. The first blow'll come from the south. Might get interesting. Outer. What's wrong Mr. Lawford. He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly. You already have. Now go on. Do it. Each one of you will be responsible for one student. I'll expect you to be courteous. You represent this school and your country. We'll sail in the morning. I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there. Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear. Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch. Everyone else hit the racks. Excellent. Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition. Then keep your mouth shut. Do you have something to say? The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up. You're a day late. We keep a schedule aboard ship. Lives depend on it. Hello, Philip. No. Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister! Hate it! Hate it away. Hate your way up one more rung!! Do it right now!! Are you hating this?! Are you! You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there! Don't look down. Look in my eyes! Climb! We'll do it together. What are you blubbering about? Sorry won't cut it. What's it going to be? Up you go. Right now. Swing up, son. Yes. I don't think one second of this is funny, sir. Yes, that's true. For killing a dolphin. They are much more than that, sir. We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable... I can't be sure. No. Yes, I was. He climbed when he was ready. I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened. No. I didn't. I am accountable. ... Absolutely not. The Coast Guard 'Eagle'. She never lost a race while you were Skipper. It wasn't hard. I understand.That's not what Skipper thought. He was trying to spill air from the main! Everybody knows why she went over Tod. You jibed the boat. Easy for you to say. Screw you, Valentino. I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody. Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".It's me, don't you see. Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch. I disobeyed order. There's still a way. It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard! Butler, what'd I ever do to you? That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook. They don't know that. We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right? I'm a kid. I'm pissin' fire man. Listen man, I think I have a problem. Sorry to here it. No. Let the blow drive the boat down wind. Neutralize our canvas. No. Twice. I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails. I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam. Or maybe you're too stupid to know that! What's that supposed to mean?! Don't mind him, Chucky. You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.Then what are you trying to say then? If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared? And you didn't do anything about it? The papers are going to eat you alive. Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission. They want someone to be accountable. The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing. Everybody goes home. I used to helm a school ship. A long time ago. How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier? May I ask you something? There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross. I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.You don't give him enough credit Chas. Nobody says you have to be like me. Why then. I thought this was your dream come true. It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff. You gonna jump? Or are you just having a last look?
