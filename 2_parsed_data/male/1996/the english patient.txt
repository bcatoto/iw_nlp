Tell me about your garden. Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again. I'm sorry, Katharine. And a good read. Don't waste it. I promise I'll come back. I promise I'll never leave you. And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party. Listen to me, Katharine. You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it. I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe. I'm going to have to walk to El Taj. Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel. And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you. Yes. Absolutely. I'm just going to find things for the fire. I know. I'm sorry. I'll make a fire. I'll be back. You're wearing the thimble. Don't talk. What? I know, darling, I'm sorry. We've got to get you out of here. Why did he bring you? Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here? Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me. Dance with me. I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there? How can you ever smile? As if your life hadn't capsized? Is he next? Do you drag him into your little room? Where is it? Is this it? What? What? That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for? Why did you hold his collar? I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny. Don't go over it again, please. I'm not agreeing. Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Of course. You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face. I don't care to bargain. It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing. Yes. A different wife. Madox knows, I think. He's tried to warn me. He keeps talking about Anna Karenina. I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat. Its my idea of a man-to-man chat. This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine! I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous. Ouch! See - you're always beating me..! It's a long song - Szerelem means love�and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool. For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave. He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of - No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me. It's a folk song. I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth. Swoon. I'll catch you. I can still taste you. I can't work. I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently. Say you're feeling faint - the sun. Say you're sick. Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me. What do you hate most? What else? Okay. And what do you love? Say everything. When were you least happy? When were you most happy? That makes it harder still. You don't sew at all! Good. I believe you still have my book. Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted. No. No, but I think I do. And the marriage - is that a fiction? Water? Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical. Come on, come on! There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid. Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book? I should like to have them. I should be honored. Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around. All true. Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised. - there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness. Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake. Yes. Absolutely. No. In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand. See what's happening to them - the stars. Look over there. You should come into the shelter. There's really no need. This is just a scrapbook. I should feel obliged. Thank you. We took several photographs, there's no need. What's this? I do not. Pardon? Her or me? He said - be careful. The Ostrich is a detour. A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method. Nothing to do with Zerzura. To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move. The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run. At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards. When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer. Haunting the ostrich. A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear. This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich. I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs. As the wife of one of our party. I was concerned. As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to. Excuse me? I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this. I apologize if I appear abrupt. I am rusty at social graces. How do you find Cairo? Did you visit the Pyramids? That insults them. This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton. You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back. Which stall? They don't see foreign women in this market. How much did you pay? How much did you pay? Daskylus� I'm sorry - what have you noticed? What kind of fossils? A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it. Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car. Thank you. And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding? The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials� - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood. Isn't that right? Oops! Mustn't say International. Dirty word. Filthy word. His Majesty! Die F�hrer! Il Duce. I haven't, no. Sorry. What? Very well. All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned - I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her. Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her? Safe journey. What kind of photographs? There you have me. Still a car. No! NO! Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep! Look, listen to me. A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here. I have been walking for three days! I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep! Count Laszlo de Alm�sy. The Officer is writing this down. A glance at his Corporal. Am I not talking sense? - forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers. I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society. What? No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle? I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and� Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk. I desperately need a jeep. There's been an accident. Could I trouble you for some water? There is no God. But I hope someone looks after you. Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands. Tomorrow afternoon. Don't worry. I'll be ready. Yes. It was. Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you. I told you so. Right. Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round. I believe I'm rather late. Own the desert. Why do they care about our maps? What's the matter with you? In my room. Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy. And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura. No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple! Look! What is that? Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility� Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly. Cut the ropes. I left a note, on his blanket. At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot. The Girl wouldn't leave, of course. Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up. I looked at them. They're shrubs, small trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane. Her hands and feet were tied. Looking for the fossils. Why should we wait until we're in London? This girl was probably twelve years old. Fritz? What are you talking about? Who's Fritz? Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me. My wife is dying. Hey! Hey! Stop this jeep! Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!Thank you. Just kiss me. It would mean such a lot to me. You're the prettiest girl I ever saw. Okay.Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Christ. Don't cut me. Come on. Don't cut me. I slept with the girl. I've got a wife in Tripoli. A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble. A nurse? Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse? Great. Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was - It's impossible. I was buying or selling something. I've been to Cairo many times. I don't know. I keep explaining. You've got the wrong man. My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini. Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you. No. She can take you as far as Florence. Well, then ask him his name! No-one should own music. The real question is who wrote the song? I liberated it. Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed. I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know. It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk. What if I told you he did this to me? Who are his ghosts? You have to protect yourself from sadness. This is the thing I've learned. You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient. Do you think he's a saint or something? Because of the way he looks? I don't think he is. I'll have some of your water. It's hot. Hana? Hana? Are you alright? Some gave me a dress. You know what's great? What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that. You should be happy. What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket. Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life? Rabbit hunting. Supper. Hana calls after him. Fine. I'm not looking. I'm okay. Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol! I'll sleep in the stables. I don't care where I sleep. I don't sleep. No. I'd like to stay. That's the long and short of it. I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah. I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be - -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug. I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that. Yeah, for a while. They're fresh. I haven't eaten an egg in�have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them? I met your friend Mary. She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier. Bonjour. Are you Hana? Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious. No, now I can't kill you. You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you. You killed my friends, you ruined my hands. But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel. And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave? But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them? There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition. It did this. If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died. What did you say? You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing. Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression. I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name. So, I come across the Hospital Convoy I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat - how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession - - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you. There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms? What? You and Madox? Or you and Katharine Clifton? Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know - Have a drink. Is there a song you don't know? For? Thought you'd never wake up! First wedding anniversary - what do you call it? Is it you? If I said Moose� I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you? Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything? I can't hide anymore. I breathe like a dog. I lose my balance. Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus. I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name. And you've forgotten yours. Are you planning to be the exception? Oh, all over. Thief, I think, is more accurate. Hello.Sorry, what's your point? It's Geoffrey under this. Have you seen Katharine? Why are you people so threatened by a woman?! I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife. I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her. I think she's know herself. Are you mad? Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday. Appropriate? You too. Good luck! Portraits. The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing. Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love. Excessive love of one's wife. A broken car? Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick. I do so love you. What do you smell of? Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war. Sweltering. Come on, I'll take you home. Right. Lady H said she thought you might be - Darling, I just heard. You poor sausage, are you all right? But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems? Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft� Well, she is! I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best - The team is in mourning, darling. Off with his head! Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army. To arm-twisting. Good heavens, are you married, Madox? Oh no, really. She has her book. Apprentices. Isn't it? Wedding present from Katharine's parents. I'm calling it Rupert Bear. Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.That's your name innit? Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish? Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding. Shut-up!Pardon me? A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears. Only we have to go to work. I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh. A toddler I'll ask the Lieutenant. But thank you. Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others - Hello miss. Yessir. You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last. I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent. Hana follows him. Don't move! Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it? I love you. Hana, I know you do! You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk. There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.I'll always go back to that church. Then come with me. It's what I've learned. I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman. I mean home. India. Will you come with me? This is hot! The lamp was burning all night in his room. Caravaggio was there with him. When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away. That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge. It's red hot. Then I'd think there must be a reason. I try not to expect you. I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some - he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean - and us - he never once� He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about. Yes. Later. This is what I do. I do this every day. Don't talk. Check again. Lie flat and then cut. No. But he hands them over. You must get away. Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling. He's going to topple over if he cuts. Okay. Get away from here. Quick. What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune? I've done this. I've had to do this. You get Hardy. There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance. I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over. The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them. I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone. For my hair? Thank you. I've met you before. Is something funny? The Germans were here. The Germans were all over this area. They left mines everywhere. Pianos were their favorite hiding places. This is making me incredibly angry. Go away. What's happening? Am I needed? Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! They're excited! They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City? Never! What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky. And now this. I looked up to you, Uncle. My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them. What's he saying? What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk. And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British. It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives. Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -May God make safety your companion. I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything. Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all. I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis. So if you need it�hard to know how long one's talking about. We might all be back in a month or two. When's Clifton picking you up? We didn't care about countries. Did we? Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans. None of that mattered, did it? It was something finer than that. Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow. I'm going to do what I can, but� And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so. Had a letter from my wife. The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to. She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever. Wrong coast I should have thought, still� Look, either shut up, or go home. Good, we're all here? A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface. What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa. Don't be so bloody na�ve. You know there's a war breaking out. This arrived this morning. By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939. Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government. They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of. And where are the Expedition Maps? Which we've overflown twice. And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore. Bermann! I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside. I was talking about the girl. What did you do? You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable. What did you think you were doing in his tent? Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo. And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons. Very much so. We are all, save my friend here. I won't hear of it. None of us will. Of course. Well, we should all go out onto the terrace. This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes. I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England. We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Alm�sy smiles and walks on towards the others. Marvelous plane. Did you look? Certainly not. Why not? A more modest expedition, or even wait a year. Remind our families we still exist. I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition. Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us. We're not accustomed to the company of women. Your book. Your Herodotus! Alm�sy looks uncomfortable.I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ - Alm�sy - would you mind just spelling that for me? What nationality would that be? Right. And what's your name, sir? If I could just see some identification. Do you have your papers, sir? I see. Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you come from? Good morning! Then you were married? This was your garden? How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything? Why? Are you German? What about your rank or serial number?No. He's - no. Third Canadian Fusiliers. He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier? If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself. And what if he really is a spy? It's not safe here. The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what. It's madness. I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us. Hana - It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean literally.I'm feeling old. I had a hotel room. A bit of one. We can do that when we're very, very old. I've got a surprise. A boat! We can go to Capri. It's got a cabin, it's private. Whoa - give me a chance!You can't kill me. I died years ago. Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't� I couldn't even do that properly. Is that what you thought? That I betrayed the British? The British betrayed me. The British betrayed me. Thousands of people did die, just different people. The rest meant nothing to me. I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise. The rest meant nothing to me. And you thought you'd come and settle the score? I see. Me? We shall miss you. Hana tells me you're leaving. What? Very true! I've had a drink. Fatal. Top Hat. Irving Berlin. What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone. I don't know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I don't remember. Moose. I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage. It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face. Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in. Like an old boxer. I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name. Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name. I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her. All over? I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed. Are you leaving us? Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds. I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts? Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket? That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club. Who knows the Bosphorus Hug? Why don't you go? You should sleep. Don't depend on it. Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right. I'm still here. - to her cooking. Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent - I don't think it's indifference. You like him, don't you? Your voice changes. Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions. I've been told that before. In that case, I suppose we can't charge. We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do? Why? Is he staying? Really? That's sudden. Sikh. If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh. K is for Katharine. Could I ask you to move? I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry. Do I recognize him? I recognize what he is. I like him. He's Canadian. He can read Italian. He can catch rabbits. That's a different dress. Something smells so rich. My stomach is heaving - Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries - Well then - yes. Of course. Just go off. I'll be quite all right. Your friend? Yes? Me? He can't. I'm already disturbed. Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place? What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you? Why? Can he lay eggs? Why are you so determined to keep me alive? Could I have a cigarette? I can see my wife in that view. Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds. As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room. I can smell it. The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth. I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint. Is there sand in my eyes? Are you cleaning sand from my ears? Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I've found the lost fossils. I can already see. Yes. Dropping off. I'm not laughing at you. Go on, please. Candaules Thank you. My book? The Herodotus? Yes, we can read him. Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me? What was all the banging? Were you fighting rats or the entire German army? There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs. Go on, do it. I don't need to hear any more. What are you talking about? Kip? This is wonderful! Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I. So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about? - The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum. I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water? Or my wife's. You tell me. I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France. No. Am I being interrogated? You should be trying to trick me. Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur. Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted. Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way. No. I think I was a pilot. I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin. I was with them for some time.
