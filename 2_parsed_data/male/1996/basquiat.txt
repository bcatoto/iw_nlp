As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese? You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them. No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of. Of what? This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else.. Let's get out of here. No, I wanted to make a painting of you. You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime. I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads... I'd take some of them out. I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit. I haven't decided yet. Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you. When's your show? Is this finished yet? Rene's been telling me about your work. Really. Huh. Too bad. No. Should I have?Oh, I didn't know that. I think it's in New Jersey. It's in New Jersey. Saddle River's in New Jersey. That would be a pity because you're a real painter. Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death. Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you. That was my favorite part! I don't like beer. I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green. I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents. Well, have you asked her to come back? Do you still love her? What's wrong? Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg. My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well. Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent. Wow... Stop giving them away. I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me? That's good. At least they're interested. Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery. My jacket? Gee, great... Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that! I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these. Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good. Ignorant art?That's the same guy who did this painting. How do you know? I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment. Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit! Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out. What about the shit they write? The whole thing � painting. Do you ever get sick of it? See ya in an hour. So what do you think? Naa.. Why, so you could humiliate me? It's always how you would do it. This is my version. What do you think? Not sure. How was yours? I don't know. Hey � it's the big A.M.. I'm a painter, too. My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me? After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing. When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now. People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work. I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you." We can do better. It needed more white. How come you're not peeing on them yourself? Piss painting? You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig? What's with the wigs? Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her. That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina. Ouch.. Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island. Cool. Yeah � I'd do that... You could teach me. Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors � anything with a SAMO tag on it. The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?" I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me. Yeah, I met her already. Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket. You don't even work on your stuff! Ten bucks apiece. Yeah... Like � stupid, ridiculous, crummy art. You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks. Sure. Hi Dad. Hi Nora. I know. When? You want a drink? You name it, I paint there. No. What do you mean? B.B. It's me � Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year? Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour. Sure, ok.. I can get ten. I'm here. I need a dealer. Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him. Should there be? Are those the only two possibilities? You wanna French fry? No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy. Who said that? We don't hang them at home, y'know � just in the streets.. Yup. No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican. Not what? I'm not black. I use a lot of colors � not only black. Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it? A primate? You mean like an ape? Leeches. A long list of leeches. It looks good like that. Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from? Everywhere. They're just words. Decipher? I hate this. Turn that off. Yeah. Yeah, just put their bill on my tab. See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill. Chateau Latour '64, please. What's wrong with you today? Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you. Why don't you try letting her in, Steve � I mean Shenge. Use your fucking instinct. Yeah.. Still not here. Yeah... Maybe just his arms. Put some Cerulean Blue there. Paint it out. Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health! Me fall? Let's get some drugs! I guess it was a long time ago. Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you! 'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?' Good. What do you have? What's your fuckin' problem, anyway? I ain't John Henry. Yeah... I'll paint on it. For real? Come on in! Check you later, man. He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these. So then what? Who's John Henry? Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else. Oh � you mean black people! About what? I am... On Gina. Fuck � I didn't think we were actually gonna do this. We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist � she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me. I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday. Here � I made this for you. Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny. "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken! "She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby! Oh yeah.. Who am I? Who's that? Willie Mays. What's his name? Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were � George? Forget it. Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole. Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're � How is he? Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me. He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him? A present I picked up for you. Hi. What's wrong with me? ... babies. Think so? Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee � Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai? You look fucking beautiful, beautiful. You want some? I'm your family. It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone. You're back. ... What's the matter? Manzanita.... ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face' Do you know what he's saying? ... I'll buy you some new ones. C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now. Wanna go get some breakfast? I thought you hated this place? Party girls? Can I call you? Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday. I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do! Can I walk you home? I guess you did. I'll take it. Andy, gimme three thousand dollars. Just the caviar � I'll get the rest. I'll take the whole tin. Is that the best quality you have? Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies. I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie. Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job? What's your name, man? Sure. I'd be glad to. That's great. Me? Why? See you later. Stand still. You like your dad's paintings? Hi. No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink. Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town. You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name? Have a Mac. Wanna Mac? I'd like to squeeze your titties. Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it. You don't even know me. I want real respect. No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get. No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me. Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros! Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens. Hey, Rene. I'll make you another one. I can't. After the show. That one's for you. What time is it? So what? Yes, Boss. If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement? I didn't know Tony Bennett painted. Tony Bennett... What do you mean? Fuck... I forgot about that. Jean Michel Basquiat. Can you put me in the ring with him? I didn't know. You don't have any!!! 'Phillips head,' right? Yeah. A what?Drugs??! Sit down! You're gonna fall out! Come on, let's get out of here. She's good. That's not how I meant it. For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell. What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me. I don't really have any problems. Good. What's the rush, John Henry? You gonna carry that around all night? We got beat. Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!! Hi Gina. Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that. What're you doing? You're doing something. He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want? Oh man! Folklore guy � worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike. Got a cigarette? Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry � fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart. Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich. Your people. You're shattering all my myths. Concentrate on the ball. Shoot. Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate. You got a date already? Thanks. Your dad called again � something about a job. Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing? SAMO. The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic � writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are.. Hey � Willie Mays.You're a fast mover. I don't eat junk food. No, I'd like the scarf. Come on. How can I ever thank you?You haven't heard? Andy's dead. I didn't see you. It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there. You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it. It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.What? What do you want? What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it. You see? You have someone to live for. What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that? What is it � did your girlfriend leave you? What? Wait a minute... talk to me. That's a beautiful name. French?They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge. Would you check out my studio some time? You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too. I really... admire you.Very well. Really? I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat. Would you like to see the wine list?I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop. Jean? Hold this, please. You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too. That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em! Yeah. A Phillips head. From the toolbox. Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?Tell me about it. What are you angry about? OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work? Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto? Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution? Why, that's from Time Magazine. I see.. And... How do you respond to being called � hmmm... � yes, "the pickaninny of the art world." Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home? Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he? Not black. You're not? What? Yes, but as a black painter � Well, you said that. You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you? Hmmm. And 'Parasites.' You seem to be a Primal Expressionist. What are they? Yes, I understand � but where do you take them from? Yes. What do they... stand for? ... Can you... decipher this for us? What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?It's in New York. New York. Saddle River, New York! Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.I know that. Don't let him get away. MOTHAFUCKAH! Just look at him. Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so. Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick. Who did this? Who did this? Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that? Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business. Forget it. You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother � when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit. Thanks... I'll take it tonight. 5:11. So shut up and keep painting.. You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true. There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know? So keep painting. My point exactly. Singing on stage and painting in your spare time. Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts � you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett.. Uh huhh... Band practice? It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...? I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates. But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy. I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything. So what's your real name? 'Samo?' You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.That's ignorant. Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT. Uh-oh! YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
