You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you. His reactor's starting to overheat. Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south. It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight. Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time. Somebody else was in there with her. Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive. ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you. Understand? Understand? You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight. Go on now. Do as I say. Now go get dressed. We have things to do. You never heard of Snake Plissken? You're stalling, Eddie. Talk, you little gringo! Where's Plissken? What? Where? You told me he was dead. Give it. Give it to me. Where is he? We'll see.C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that. Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant. Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre. L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule. The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours. Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how. Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man. You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake. Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype? Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens. Plissken...? Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch. Nuclear turbine to 75% power. Lock fuel rods. No. A medical team will be standing by. Let's just say it's what's best for the country. Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there. Once you go inside, you're on your own. You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you? We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason. All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m. Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States. There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know? Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon. I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken. You don't understand. It's already in you. Having second thoughts? That's the deal. That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back. Top secret. Only on a need to know. Shut up, Plissken. How you doin' Plissken? You like the watch? Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you. Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button. The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President. Shall I begin evacuation? Getting ready to invade. It's the President, for Christ's sake!Cuervo, look out behind you! He's... near. It's so good to see you again. Oh Cuervo... I thought he was, but he came back. You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken. Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you. You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man. He jumped. Down there. He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken. Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised. Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em. So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo. I got an idea, Snake. This looks like the prototype, right? I don't know about this thing. Aw, come on, Snake. Me too? I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit. Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right. I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man. Sure, Snake. No problem. You gonna kill me? I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen... Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you. Right over there. All right. Anything for you, Snake. Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place. No way. Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time. Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you. Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know. Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings. Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake. You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there. Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours. Good. I want you out. This is my sewer. What're you doing in here?Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way. You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help. You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up. Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man. Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake. Could be a big one comin' any minute now... Down that way. Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off. Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress. I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely. She's overloaded! We're too heavy. If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me. I don't know yet. You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world? We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out. Say goodnight, Carjack. Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour. I'm already dead. I got a new deal for you. Don't lie to me. Wait a minute. I know that voice. You're Carjack Malone. I need a favor. The name's Plissken. Got a smoke? Yeah, I got it. It's history. I gotta go. I'm here. 75% power. Locked. She's in the green. Good. Not you? By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin? So you want me to take her out? Is that an order from the President? Where do I put ashore? So what does this thing do? Defense against what? I'll need to know more about this thing. Call me Snake. Get this crap out of me. Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time. Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about? Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A. So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free? And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood. What's the little black box do? You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want? Is that what I think it is? If he lets you get close enough. Yeah, kinda. Don't like it, don't come. Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God. We'll see. How do you know all this? Cease fire with the bullshit. Later. Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe. Not yet. Where are they going? Where is it? I said pull over. Stop the damn car. Delgado? Location. Where are they? Where'd they go? Yeah. So how do I get to Venice? Which way? Looking to get out. Who? Where? Where's... Cuervo Jones...? Which way to the Hollywood Bowl? Who? Find Cuervo Jones. I know that. There are people in some of these cars. What the hell is this? Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil? Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay? How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city. How do we get out of here? The what? This is a dead end. You took us into a dead end! Like hell I do. Don't follow me. Who? No screamin' shit. What are they? Are you crazy? Where's the anti-toxin...? Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in. I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is. Well, I'll think it over. I can see you're real concerned about your daughter. Uh-uh. Bluebacks. The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars. Yeah. Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay. You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland. I'm looking for somebody.You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug. Does he know how to activate it? So where's Plissken? I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man. Give me the prototype. Thank God. You're running out of time. Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack? Shit. I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money. Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him. I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake. Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them. All of us? Hershe, you were in Cleveland? Who ain't? Hey, what's going down, Snake?
