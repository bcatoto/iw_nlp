You're money, baby. Don't do it, Mike. You should call your Grandmother. Are you calling Her? You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges... That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it. Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this. Ever since I've known you. You've been through worse. You have to put things in perspective. Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if... Skipping message. End of final message....then ask where you met her... They're out of Glenlivet. Why not? This place is dead anyway. ...and even then... I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore... No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway... Oh. You know. I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you... ...I heard it took four days to light for that shot... Hey, man. At least it's Disney. I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking... You haven't told then, huh? Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it? Hi.Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables. You want this in black chips. You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it. You have to lay it on the table. On the table.Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off? Shut up. Shuddup. No. Stop, come on. Enough. I've got to use the phone. Okay. I'll think about that. Bye. It didn't feel that way. I don't know about that. You're right. I know. I know, I know. Shit. Thank you, Nikki. Well, thank you...? Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever. Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago. Are you sure? Maybe... Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas... Yeah. ...Monday nights? I host an open mike... You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico? Thanks. You like laughing at the misery of others? Oh... a Cavalier. I'm sorry? How are you ladies doing this evening? No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to... Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either... Uh, if the guy wants to. Anything. I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want. What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom. What what? What advantages? Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single. It does. It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it. Yeah. Tell me about it... How was it hard? Just like that? Not lately. My reputation seems to have preceded me. I like quiche. Like the quiche? I'm Mike. Hi. Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like. Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"? Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number... What else is going on? You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies. ...you might get cut out. ...not until you book it... ...and boy does it hurt when they ask. ...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East. Did you, um, did you get that pilot? Charles! What's up, man? I'm a comedian. No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night. Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it. Could you believe it? Do you have anything smaller? Sure, that'll be fine. Huh? Oh... right. Uh, I don't want to bet it all. Sorry? Sorry, it's just that... Can I check my messages? I have a calling card. Six years. We were a rebound, and we lasted six years. Why not? I know, but she did. She's with someone else now... Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between... Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet... There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand... Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy... No... Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on. That's okay. I wanted to talk to you. Hi. Sorry about that. No, no. Hold on. Yeah, hold on. Lorraine? Hello? ...get the hell outta here already... ...The red piece of shit over there... ...Nah. I'm right across the street... ...It's really getting late. Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card. Why, you like the duck with the cigar? ...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into... When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan. If and when I get a real gig I'll call you. Yeah. And an actor. That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you. I would love to see you again sometime. Listen. I had a great time. Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you. I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye. Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call... Hi. Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French? ...the Michelin commercial... Why didn't you call? Really? I thought you met someone else. What kind of things? Yeah? Fine... I guess. You? ...Six months. You always know the right thing to say. Wow. You wanna grab a bite? You miss the pain? How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting? Then why won't she call...? I didn't make it... They turned you down? How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing? What's dumb about it? I think I'm gonna move Back East. I'm such an asshole. Uuuuugh! What's the point? Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea... No. Just O.J. Thanks, man. I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man? No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later. I got to at least try once. There are so many beautiful women here. He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though. ..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat. Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan. Well, let's hit that party. ...yeah, a month ago. Charles and me went to network on this pilot together. Ah, there's the rub... Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts. I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it. I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool. ...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please. I'll get a Dewars rocks... Kinda money, huh? ...That's probably a more appropriate analogy. It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism... It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front. To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven. Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry. What'd you get? I don't know. Eight or Nine. What do you have? A Pluto call back? You want to hit the town tonight? I've decided to get out there. Go ahead. Play it out. The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that. I didn't mention her once today. I don't talk about her that much. What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it? Why? Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today? You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now. What do you want? You're tall. Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town. You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role. It's a gig. Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her. ...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps. Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time... There's the rub. Unless she comes back first. Right... Wait, what do you mean? So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her. Well that sucks. So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her. So what's the difference? So I don't call either way. But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her. And what if I don't want to give up on her? She's really special, guys. Believe me, I know what that's like. Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving? Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it. What are they doing here? ...It was six months, and she didn't dump... You live in such a fantasy world... Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it... You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg? You asshole. She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself... I can't believe you. Not well. Who threw this party, anyway? ...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese... He's trying to be an actor. So, what? Eleven? Give me the money. I'll get it. Make someone bleed. You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game. Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again. Wow, I guess you were home... Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along? Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months... Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry. This is Mike. 213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something... ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry. I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment". Coffee... Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right? Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly. Guys... Guys... I got it under control. I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight. It's not like that... I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good. What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot. So, two days? Tomorrow? How long do I wait to call? You're not just, like, fucking with me? Please, don't mess with me right now... What a surprise. That doesn't matter. You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up. I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me. I'm sorry. She didn't notice. What? Which one? How you guys doing? ...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights... ...the Copa, in New York... Yeah. You met him once. What time's this party tonight? You guys are such assholes. No. What? That was the best part of the old game. This version doesn't have fighting? I hear she's getting real fat. I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something. He drives a carriage. Selling scrap metal. ...a day... Don't remind me. I just need some time... I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better. That was different. Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you. I just don't think she liked me in that way. Yeah, a good friend. I don't think so. She didn't like me, anyway. I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag? She was hot. Christy was nice... Sorry about interrupting... She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie? Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man. I gotta use the phone. No, man. I need to use the phone. So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."? ...So give me the fuckin part... No! Not the camera guy! No! "Big Brother", "Little Brother"? What was the part? Well... we're not in Kansas anymore. Whatever. I'm Mike... and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent". We didn't do so bad after all. I hope so. We gotta go soon. ...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though... "Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."... I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head. I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect... I know. I know. That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit. ...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to... It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy... It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know... That's bullshit. I don't know... She likes you. I'm too tired for this. Let's just go. You think so? I don't think so. What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back? Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it. She was smiling at what an asshole you are. I can't believe what an asshole you are. That was so demeaning... What an asshole. What an asshole. Let's go. Let's just leave. You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry. Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop? Yea, how much? Thanks for clarifying that. But I lost! How can you say always?!? I'm just saying, not in this particular case. Yeah? Well obviously not always! ...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money... I know, but... What?!? Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching. That's where we make our scene. The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free. Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around. First let's see what happens if we play it cool. You're gonna screw up our plan. It doesn't matter... That's not cool. Cut that shit out. Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift. They're all skanks. This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps. This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland. Pirates of the fucking Caribbean. Whu? Vegas. Vegas! Vegas! Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight? I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you. I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though. Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works. No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit. What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits. Wait. I can't lose more than a hundred. I'm not going to Vegas. You're crazy. When? What Vegas? What are you talking about? Vegas? We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke. I don't know... Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow... I don't know... S'up Trent?...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud... ...Four days..? I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy". No. I haven't heard an official "no" yet. My pleasure. By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight. Sure. ...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long. Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile. Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it. That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money". See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too... They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job. At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy... Well, you're doing so well... Well, that's dumb. She wasn't your type anyway. Oh boy. It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki... You want to talk about it? Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles. You haven't been drinking, have you? No problem, buddy. You eat anything today? I'll be your winger. Go for it, man. You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown. It's unbelievable. Him? Oh, like that song... What's that guy's name? Sue? ...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone. I just tested for one... There's the rub. I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them. It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it. Darwinism at its best. I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are. Bud. Classy. Sounds more like Aids... That doesn't sound too good for business. Oh. Where is this place? So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten? An eight. I'll give you an eight. How many strokes? Sure. Kick me when I'm down. I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight. I do. Good for you, man. Well, until now. Tend the pin. Oh no? Kinda. I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter. I didn't want to say anything. It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money." Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot. There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character. It's definitely a step back for me. I mean, I need the money. I don't think I'm gonna take it. Thanks. Thanks, man. No problem. Hey man, don't sweat it. There's the rub. Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore. I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care. Right... or more likely the opposite. It sucks. Right. The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back. Right. Right. You don't call.Good for you, man. He's being smart. Thanks, man. I've been hating myself for the last two days. But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going... We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk. I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun ...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up... What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago... ...People get carjacked... Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A... He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing. She was cute. Big butt... you know, can't fly coach. Rejected? How's it going for you two? Damned if I know... ...He's derivative... What's he do? ...which means no one will get there 'til ten. Pause it. No, man, we're in the play-offs. It's kinda money, actually. Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup. You little bitch! ...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. ...just be smart about it. You don't have to wait three days... Be smart about it. ...Definitely... Sorry man. It is on. ...it's definitely on. ...it's on. I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch... Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once? Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them... ...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey. What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep. Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you. ...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious... Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard... ...Tomorrow, then a day. You're money. ...you're so fuckin mmmoney. ...honestly... ...you're like a big bear. ...and you got big claws and fangs... ...You're just poking at it... ...shivering... ...and big fuckin' teeth... ...we're not... You are so money, and you don't even know it... True. ...double diamond... You think? That was pretty cold, dude. Yes she did. No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked. No. No. ...It's on. ...How novel. ...Is he brown? Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse. I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something. Fuck!!! That is so bullshit! They're a finesse team... That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit. Bitch... You little bitch!Let me just check on my boy. It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four. Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically... No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me... Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town. Oh. He's got it under control... Don't give me that! She liked you, man. You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you? You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit? What the fuck..? Yeah. I guess you could call it that. No... A day. No, baby! We're not messing with you... What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby. We got the digits, baby. She didn't see. Why, baby? What'd I do wrong? Was I money? Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up. You looked right at her, baby. What are you doing? Minnie Pearl. It's on. ...It looked money. ...through the kitchen... Yeah. He's a "rounder". Who? Rob? It starts at eight... Aww... He got away? Yeah. No. Doesn't that suck? I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne. Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off. Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey? What?!? See? And what does this guy she's with do? ...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing? You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie... Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat. That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby. How? Michelle went for you, right. Baby, you're so money you don't even know it. Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip. I heard them talking. They both thought you were money. She thought you were money. No, baby. You're money. She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy? I didn't even like her, to be honest. Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time. You didn't have to get into it, baby. Hold on. Baby, you'll check them tomorrow. What? Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven." I'm telling you! Wait... She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy. Yes! Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying... Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother. Oh... a Dorothy. Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job. Stop. Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven? Baby, we're money. Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine. You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money. ...Baby... Baby, you did fine. Nice, baby. Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party. They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it. That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't? Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress... ...gotta... You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there. It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you. You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them. Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends. Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you. You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies. Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby. I know she's coming back. Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails. She was smiling at how money I am, baby. Did she, or did she not smile. She smiled, baby. That was money. Tell me that wasn't money. Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner. Mikey's the big winner. Who's the big winner? Baby, you're money. You're the big winner. Baby, don't talk like that, baby. Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table. I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe. Hey, man, I'm down too, you know. ...Well, you know, not counting the first table. Always. Always, baby. I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven. If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well... You gotta do it. Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven. Double down. You think they're watching? Well, you look money, baby. We both look money. Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby. What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us? We're gonna get laid, baby. I'm telling you, they love that shit. Did she, or did she not smile? She smiled baby. What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys. Baby, there are beautiful babies here. That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby. You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money. This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates. Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby! Wake up, baby. Vegas. Vegas, baby! Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby! I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas! I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing. Be downstairs. You're beautiful. Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes. Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller. What? Just bring your card. Half an hour. Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way. I'll pick you up in a half an hour. Tonight, baby. We're going to Vegas. VEGAS. You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas. I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment. Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her. Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there. That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency. Lemme get off the other line, baby. Hello? Our little baby's growing up... ...Okay, two... I'm telling you. Wait three days... The bear's got his claws back. Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home. ...it is so on. It's on. It's on... Sue! ...Shut up, Sue... ...Sue... ...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything... ...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat. ...Anaheim... You dick. Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party. Yeah, but three days is kinda the money... ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think? ...Yeah. Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like. Now go over there and get those digits. ...you're money... ...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"... ...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared... ...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"... ...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner... You're like this big bear with claws and fangs... That's what I keep trying to tell him. You're so money, you don't even know... Baby, don't talk that way, baby... ...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk. Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail... It's on. What was cold about it? Damn. Now I gotta go in early. See, baby? Is she looking now? Now? Is she looking at me, baby? Oh, it's on, baby... What a surprise... Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail! You could make their heads bleed, though. They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick! ...against the computer. Because he's a bitch. Chelios to Roenick...! I'll have the Blackbeard over easy. Beautiful. What time are you off... ...Christy? ...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
