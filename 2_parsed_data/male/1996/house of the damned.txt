Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death... The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed. By freeing them. The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs - It's origin is unknown. The symbol does correspond to a dagger I acquired many years ago. May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long. She's coming back. Keep talking! Concentrate! She can hear you! Go ahead. I believe right now she may hear you. Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her. The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it - I'm going to need some blood. It must be from a woman. Your daughter's been taken. I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in... In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here. She would call me, and I would come by. She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly. Thank you. I believe she would have wanted it. May I come in? ...at her request. She was a very religious woman. You must be a Londrigan. Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass. Take care of the girl. Take care of your family. They are important. I wish I had an answer. Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems. But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us. I didn't do anything...God saved her... Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other - Keep talking! It will not take long... I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me. I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there. It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it! We must return it, if you want your daughter back. I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me. I've been here before to cast evil from this house. The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals. It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost. Did you remove anything in the cellar! The amulet... Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over. And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us. Well there's no time like the present. Good night. Perhaps I'll see you in church. I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home. Well thank you for the offer, But I really have to go. Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul. She would hear things, see things... My name is Father Seamus. I'm from Holy Rood church. You must be the new tenants.We don't have proof of that. So many unanswered questions. Why was she buried there. And who killed her? What was her name? Did you find something? What's the matter? I feel something. It's faint, but...it's there... My God, I heard something! Take me to her. Where is she now? Where is she? White meat will be fine... I'm hungry enough to eat a horse. Maura. You've done your homework, Mrs. South. I'm not sure, but I can check. Did the events start before or after you discovered this? If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled. Where is your daughter? She might be able to give us some information. We usually find nothing. We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation. We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems. Unfortunately. I could see if I detect the presence of something. Not at all. I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be. I don't know! Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall! There's something through that wall! There's something in there. Do you mind if I borrow it? I see some faint lettering. It appears to be the...Runic alphabet? Where did you find this? Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at? Not someone. Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before. Looks like we have some animal hairs in here. Maybe some kind of a rodent. Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that. Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend. A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds. That would include myself and an assistant. No. But I'm a clairvoyant. I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.Good-bye. I'm sorry. How's your arm? Are you all right? No! Why don't you pass me your plate? Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us. I have to admit I was skeptical. Until now. How did you meet Dr. Shea? Thank you. If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it. Do you live around here? What will they tell you? Suppose not. Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal - Good night Angel... Well, that all depends. Oh my God! She's in there! Don't be afraid! Fight it back Aubrey. Fight it back as hard as you can! We're here Aubrey! Look, don't be afraid. We want you to come back to us... That's great, honey. That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did. Lived here my whole life. For good luck honey. He's blessing the house. Ok. If you want this room, you can have it. Sure. Did you see the others? I'm all right... Are you all right? Maura! No... NO! Not going! Are you out of your mind?! Wait! Maura, what is this! What are you talking about? What? Know what? No. You two are the most important things in my life. I don't ever want to lose you. You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we? You don't have any doubts about me, do you? Ok... It doesn't matter to me. What do you mean by that? Aubrey! Aubrey?! Aubrey?! I think everything's ready. A friend? What are you talking about? Whoa there... It just disappeared. Literally. I'm being realistic. Look, I have a spiritual side. I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house. That should count for something. Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house. Oh come on! Who? There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something. Who knows? I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting. Well, I try to keep an open mind, but... Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened. So what are you saying? It was in the cellar. Weird. No. The heater's here. ...set up some more things. Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly. I just want to... No. Maybe it was Aubrey. I don't know. That's strange. What? God rest her soul. Or what she was worth. Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her? To our family. Whatever you say. Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura. It's over. You know that. Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it. She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment. What will Aubrey think? Oh come on... What's the matter? Who knows... we have to get used to living around here. Maybe good help is hard to find. The place is pretty dusty. Yeah I'll look into that tonight. Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here... We'll be there. Yes, they are. What's going to happen? I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did... The rain is letting up. It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey. Think about us. We're here for you, we love you... How long will it take! What are you getting at! So what does that have to do with Aubrey! Where is she! What...amulet? This isn't happening... We'll never know for sure. Good night. Thank you. Did you have dinner, father? We have plenty. What was she afraid of? How can I help you? And you...are? Well what is it! What? Not at all, if it can help. Runic? It was nailed to the cellar wall. Not really. Oh, wait a minute. So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here? And what would you do? Oh.
