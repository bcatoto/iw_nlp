Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood... surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp... Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?! You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together. Isn't that right...? They're reaching out to you, Rowan! With his hands! Two heartbeats. There are two. Are you alright...? You look pale. Lasher will act, Rowan. Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it. facing him alone... I don't like - But you've not told Michael. I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both. Thank you for this honor, my dear. Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane... geography seems irrelevant now. A spacial entity. An organized energy. something that precedes our definition of existence. Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith. Rowan... What are you talk--- Every day twice. Nothing was ever more false. Yes - and you have. Do you see...? He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could... What have the witches always asked of you...? Michael, Rowan should - Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you. Take off your gloves, Michael. There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid. what defines you in the landscape, Michael...? what anchors your life...? Your work...? Your creativity...? A spirit. Perhaps evil... ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him. Come. There is a lot to read I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated. A few hours. With her family. Rowan's mother died yesterday. Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael. At the cemetery by now, I would guess.I'll tell OR we're bringing - uh - then he - be just - - and he seemed okay. Just banged his - Parents say he - uh - fell -Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch! I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did. They made a deal with the devil. Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit. And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...' In certain cases, hell is the operative word.Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come. Your time is gone. Ju1ien was your father Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same... That is why he fought carlotta for your life. They want to come back. We have a pact - of mutual desire and consent. The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry. I have weaved you all together - from the start. I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne. He had genius in him. Scientific, precise. It was a perfect start. And on it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter... It was an accident. Gifford, too. Tell me what I am, Rowan. That is what you must discover. see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am. There was no thought. There was no act. That is not what I am. I do not understand... What is wrong...? Go on. Rowan. Go on. Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything... Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me... Then help me--- for his sake... --- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat. I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers... Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...? to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.? I did not choose to be such as this! Suzanne brought me here. She called to me! No, my love. I want nothing more of the dead. I want you to --- chang me. I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do... ...but Marguerite could not help me. Nor Julien... Do not tell me that! But I could understand. I want to understand! you crave what I might show you. What you can learn. What I can give you. So much more than Michael can. A girl...? From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me! suzann. and Deborah. Stella - Marguerite - Antha - Diedre - All of them. And you will have a child... If that were true, I would not be here. There is no one here but the dead. I bring her flowers too. I am only what you are --- what all of you have been. what do you think of yourself now, my love...? If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me. Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel... If you knew how I yearn for that... It is from love. Explain this to me --- violated...? I 1ove you, Rowan. I've always loved you. I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now. Always loved you.. I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be. Like this...? There are things you will not tell him. You do not love Michael How can you love - if you lie...?I am your son. I would not wound you. I could not - ever. 'Kill you...?' You are my mother. Do you think I would hurt you...? ENOUGH! He is dead. You are here for me now. Michael is gone! How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?Always loved you. Rowan. Always... Like this... LIKE THIS...? Rowan...You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back! He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child! Aaron - lieten to me... It's been Lasher - from the start! I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house. you'll check on her - every day...? Then tell me. Is it Lasher.... on't know what else to do. Maybe I just don't belong in her life. well - I'm already out of her life. "Go back, Michael. Do what you can..." NO! she's pregnant, Aaron. she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this. don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me... Listening to my heart, aren't you...? The Timex still ticking...? Don't tell Rowan about this. Rowan. No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...? A what...? I - r saw him as a child. Lots of times... But no one else did. You sound certifiable. Yon know that. Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family. How do you know about Rowan ...? I didn't --- Cemetery...?

I like seeing it that way, y'know...? I took off my gloves today - with Aaron - - and it was okay. You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house. Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor. You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...? Either do I. I love you, Ro. You know that.

Think of what's in that book. Think of last night! Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan! C'mon. Let's go to the ho--- Ro - you can't really believe that.

Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...? you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really - Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...? All I meant was - Doctor's orders- - -? Why don't you let at do that...? Okay. y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah. Ms. yin, and Mr. yang Aha! It's come to that, huh...? Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...? He fools around with his patients too. Too much... too fast...? Really...? Your family there...? Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's... The Man With The Eyes In His Hands... My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside. The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that. It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself. Like I'm fading away- You knelt there, helpless- You couldn't save him. There was so such anger in you-. Death infuriates you... What're you - a mindreader...? Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.? you're very --- different. Like this...? LIKE THIS...?! Rowan... You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...?

But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head- It won't go away God - if I could just understand it. My jury's still out on that, I don't remember you at all- You - you saved my life- Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...? 'Freak at the week.' That's what the TV crew. call it- people come right to the house.

That I could lose the gloves at some point. Go away, GODDAMNIT! On which planet...? Go home, Stu I'll call you. I just - hate it when they're - finished.But it doesn't make sense. They - they used Lasher... they conspired with him. But why would they do that...? Two what...? I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health. I'm the doctor. Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's. Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael. I can't bear to see anymore. He's not to know. Swear to me. I have seen him again. Last night. You've been shadowing the family for thirty years. It's only fitting you give one af us away. Michael - you loved that house as a child. You could work again! You could make it ours.

I know that you're evil. I LOVE MICHAEL. MICHAEL!! I LOVE him! What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand. It's too soon to know.

Pretty, huh...? Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever --- You're very clever, aren't you...? It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose. And you will feel that. Do you understand...?

No - I didn't kill him. Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...? Michael! Nobody makes a car like them Nasis... Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm... Mm-hmmm... Dropped it. A little wine...? So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...? Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence - That's GREAT! And I thought I was the mindreader. Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael. No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know. Than letts get rnarried, Michael. I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes. I don't think of us that way - ever. If we married, we'd shut him out forever. He can't hurt us, Michael. It's us - our love. He can't find a crack in it. He can't find a way in. Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff--- Everyone - this is Michael curry. You sure...? I'll bet she had a wonderful smile. They need doctors in New Orleans too. Michael - think what I could do with the money! I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch. I've come home, Michae1, for the first time. I want to stay here - with you. Do you love me, Michael...? I am! And so are you. You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause) Michael, if you don't want - Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon. And my life is not a cosmic whim! I am in charge of my life - - and I want to stay. Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me. Helpless. I should have been here. But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...? He's in there! Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?! where are you, goddamnit...?! Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...? God, Michael --- what am I...? Michael - I saw him! Twice! Carlotta said I --- killed Graham - with - with my anger. She - she said I - I was a --- You know...? Goodbye, Michael. I love you. Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans. Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me. I'll call you there. Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I - Listen. Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael... Michael! Jesus I've been trying - We're quite a pair, you and I. You could fly down tomorrow. I could be there the next day I think I can last that long without you. Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...? I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute In L.A., remember...? He said he'd see you. He was intrigned. Michael - this place is increadible. You - you're brilliant... The things you created... Stop it. I'm serious. You don't - Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...? We don't even know - You don't know what you meant - because you don't know me. Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there. Captain's orders. Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D. Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H. Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence. You look very deep when you do that. It's interesting. We're Complete opposites- I'd never just sit and wait for insparation. I'd skip my turn and swap some letters. you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging. Kinky...? He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings. Mm-hmm. Scared- I feel a little like the moth and the flame. Nope- My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth. El1ie was my only blood relation. so she brought me here... the day after I was born. I was born, in New Orleans, too- You still feel that crazy...? And whose houses do you design...? It's unbelievable that you can do that. My uncle. Graham. He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me. He - he - had a stroke- Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year. What else did you see- Michael...? I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you. Yessssss... HARDER! Harder... No. I'm not. Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things. You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body - Just one. The bar's closed. What do you see...? Do they keep everything 'out' ...? Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative. I'm in the life business - remember..? I'm glad you're around to say it. I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage. I guess so. The trick is remembering how to act like one. I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you. Why don't we go to my office... Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool. Aloof. Is that what you were doing...? I thought it was 'whistle while you work. I like him. He can stay. He's got great hands. I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...? Rowan Mayfair. I plan on liquidating almost evetything. No tax shelters. No funding. I want to fund the clinic - exclusively. The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic. I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction. I've decided not to open a practice here I want to set up a research clinic. For infant genetic disorder. Papers...?Yessss... Harder... Harder...That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash. That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that. Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could - Standard for a Mayfair marriage. Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael that is it's in the will - for centuries. Tradition enjoins, Rowan. of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into - We'd better get to work on the papers.A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville. Oh, sweet decadance. Left behind...? This about Rowan...? You okay...? Wow... That's a wasp. Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored- so - where is she...? Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time. How are the hands...? You can't just - Bullshit! Let me in! Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont. sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change. You always do. Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that. I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...? Is that a crack about our singing...? Hey - I love gloves- I look really great in gloves. You really love this guy...? Sut McKinley. Marry me.
