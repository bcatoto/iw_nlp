To friends. Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... Come on! You asked for my help. You asked for my help...come on... C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.Maybe we don�t have to know what he looks like. If he�s got that list, he�s going to want to check it. We should be looking for laptops. Nothing but civilians, Gene. What kind of show. But why tell us? What�s Hunt doing on the TGV? Only four more cars. What about him...? Same thing he wanted in Prague! Same thing he's always wanted! The NOC list! That's S.O.P.. So what do you suggest? Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.I always have, Claire.. Claire. Claire...Hey... Of course - I�m sorry to hear you say that Claire. You are my eyes. Stay with him. Kittridge is Job. Max delivered. How far is he from Luther? Is this the only way? I sent the message to Max. We�re on for tomorrow. He's expecting my call. I'm going to the station... And I'm going to call him. Kittridge... We did what we had to do. What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply. I lost the team. I just need you to be safe. I just need you to be safe. I didn't say that. It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away. May I come in? We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local. You're sure about this? I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job. I'm going to answer it. Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me. I'm going to get it for him. Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me. I've been disavowed. They think I killed Jim and everyone else. Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account. Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list. Who sent you?! Who sent you? Did they send you...Did they send you? That was four hours ago! Who sent you? Did they send you here? Where were you? Take off your God damn coat! Take off your coat. There was nobody on the bridge. Don't give me that! I was on the bridge. Shut up! I saw you. You were in the car. You were in the car! Don't move. Sarah's reconsidering. Claire, transport in five minutes. If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch. Talking's good, walking's better. Walk, just walk. Start walking. We got it. On your feet. If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse? Can I ask you something, Kittridge? I see you've been out visiting the folks. Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset. How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole. This whole operation was a molehunt. But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. The arms dealer. Let's see if you can follow me around this room. The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team. You're worried about me. Why ? Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight. Why was there another team? Who else is left? You mean I've lost enough agents for one night. Yeah. I follow you. Yeah. No sir. You�re in Prague? Yes. I don�t think so. Do you read me? The list is in the open ! They knew we were coming. Golitsyn�s dead too. The disk is gone. My team. Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- don�t know They�re dead. Go secure. Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way. He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough. Gotta catch my flight.. So. How's it feel being a solid citizen again? Just don't know why I'd be doing it. It's all one big negotiation, isn't it? You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing? You're more than that, Luther. They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it. They want you back in. Here's to you, Luther. To being off the disavowed list. Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys. About what? I'll get you close. Exactly, that's your job. Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. What's the range of this thing? Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it. Now I want you to hold onto it. Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down. Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses. May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you. You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks. This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of. What'd they used to call you? The Net Ranger? Phineas Phreak? The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom. Profitable. Information. What about Job? It doesn�t, dear girl. as long as you tell me where the money is. I wouldn't dream of it. I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money. How will you make sure Job will be there? Ten million. Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached. And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange. What was your deal with Job? Thanks, Max. Or is it Maxine? Okay, use it. But I suggest pack up first. Tell you what. How good's the RF scanner you used in the car? Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits. Because I can deliver the actual NOC list. The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location. Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction. That's the question I want to ask Job. I'm NOC. Was. Now disavowed. Like Job? The disk Job sold you is worthless. It's bait, part of an internal molehunt. Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That depends. Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand. I need one hundred thousand dollars. Let's move! Do you want to blow the fire through the whole building? I gotta go in there and shut it down! What sector's the air conditioning? What's the matter, you don't know this trick? My contact is extremely shy. We're not outta here yet. Time up. Zero body count. In Langley. IMF mainframe. Simple game. Four players. Exfil opens the pocket -- -- cyber ops lifts the wallet. Stairway, you�re wrapped, go to transport. In position. Jack open the door, let the package roll. He's got it. Saved your ass again Jack. Jack. Jack. Give me the God damn gum. Always. IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?! Jack. No, we�re going to recover the disk, understand?! Now move! Sarah eye on the package. Jim, I�m coming to you. Jim we can�t. Jim. Jim. He�s in the open. OK. Taking Golitsyn's exit. Jack, open the doors. Right, right. Good. Higher. Higher. I'd say you've got about two minutes. I'm willing to take the chance. I don't communicate very well through a shroud. Then what am I doing here? I thought I was going to see Max. Why? Jim, it�s over. You�re wrong about one thing. I�m not the only one who�s seen you alive. Aren�t you going to thank me Jim. Ten million is better than six. Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town? I knew about Jim. Before London. But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago. And get a doctor. Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash. I�ll call you from Paris. You�re probably right. Jim...? If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. I�ll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train. Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris. A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris. What he didn�t get in Prague. The NOC list. We don�t have to, Jim. He�ll come after us. How did Kittridge do it?.. Kitteridge. Oh my god! Kittridge is the mole? Jim, who do you think you're kidding? A doctor's gotta look at that. You can't sit up straight. I remember.. You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street. Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records - - and picked us up in the States - About two hundred yards from the bridge. Negative , Golitsyn�s on the move. Can you lose him? We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times. Sure. If the main character does. He won't be back in a hurry? Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? You're going to use Walter? How was Chicago? Why not? I guess. What problem? Tell you what? Oh? What's the problem? I thought I'd take some now. Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.Wait! Hold it - it's on. Let's go. Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off. Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.Roger that. Opening doors now. Give me a break, Pops. I didn't touch it. Just don't chew it. Sorry, am I interrupting? Just waiting for you, tubs. Claire. And a lonely ass. Too wicked to have a drink later? That's what we do isn't it? Why don't you take a look? What's going on? No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now? Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge. Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here. Can you hear me?Yes, Anatoly, yes. His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. You're right, of course. They'll kill me. I don't remember what happened! We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.Good idea. This is bullshit - we don�t even know what Max looks like. I don�t know. It didn�t say on the tickets. He�s putting on a show, Barnes. High speed train. No-one gets on. No- one gets off. High security. Good place for a pass off to Max. And if we don�t find him - we�ll search the whole train again. You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops. Understand? It never happened. Okay! Think , for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face! What does Ethan Hunt want ?! S.O.P.. Let's not waste time chasing him. Make him come to us. Everybody�s got pressure points. Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze. What can we do, Barnes? Put a guy at the airport? How many identities do you think Hunt has? How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries? These guys are trained to be ghosts. We taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake! The man's gone black, Barnes. He's under until he decides to surface. I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me? Certainly Ethan. It's Hunt. What do you need for a pinpoint? Been watching a little T.V., have you? Kittridge. Ethan, I can understand you're very upset. Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan. So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane... Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said. You survived. Correct the actual list is safe at Langley. "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours. That's right. Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314". The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations. We have a penetration. The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max." You're right. Maybe this'll save some time. I don't quite follow you. What? Yes. I see your point. You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan. We've lost enough agents for one night. Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley. Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects. Follow me? I can't tell you how sorry I am. I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan. Personally as well as professionally. One hour. Heard a lot about you, Hunt. Don�t disappoint me. Location green. One hour. I�ll be there myself. Don�t think , be sure . Are you clean? Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay? Were you followed? Are you intact ? Are you damaged? Who�s dead? Go ahead. This is Kittridge.Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you? Not while I'm holding this. May take a little time. If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox? I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA. Is he serious? That's not it. That's not the list. You're not going to any meeting without me. Merci. We'll see. Where exactly is it? Bank?Oh man...I don't know. I'm gonna miss being disreputable. You really liked Phelps, didn't you? Why don't you come back with me? I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it. Sure. They want me back in so I won't break in! They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it. Hey, I'm the flavour of the month! The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards. Reach your folks? How they feeling? It's hard to tell. I'm gonna have to be close. I'm not letting this list get out in the open. What makes you trust me? Krieger did have the NOC list. I can't just hack my way inside. There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone. I'd have to be physically at the terminal. And I get to keep the equipment when we're done. Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- with the artificial intelligence Risk chip -- You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto. Cray access. STU 3's -- There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that.. With that exceptional piece of work. What kind? What are we downloading?Forty-four. Forty-five. Very well. If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely. Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say. You misunderstood. No one sees Max. You wish to meet Max? This is the price of admission. Would you remove your hat please? It�s working. I always check the batteries. It�s not working. Connection denied. Yes... It�s him. Twenty minutes. Thirty-two and change. Twenty-six, twenty-seven. So far so good.Now we don�t have to eliminate him? You like that, don�t you Claire? Don�t you? Fold it. Fold it tight. Satisfied? Well Claire do you? Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them? Why the masquerade? Why take the risk? Well, Claire, you�ve asked the question and you are the answer. Two minutes til Krieger shows. This�ll have to be quicker than I�d like. Certainly quicker than you�d like. Course he did. Just exactly when he knew is something of a question. Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan? Ethan - I�ve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth. It can kill you. Sorry Ethan. Times up. Say goodbye. Don�t flatter yourself - six was for Eastern Europe . You made a lousy deal - ten for the world? What is that? But I needed you for the transfer with Max. I got a little extra change; and you got a little extra too. Keep counting Claire. But, he didn�t know about you. In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods. "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbour�s wife", Ethan. Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it. And like all the world�s lovers, he�s tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?" They stamped it, didn�t they? Those damn Gideons. Good luck. You got it. I usually am. - no. She can�t know about me. No one can. Not til this is over. There�s too much at stake, Ethan. I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking I�m dead and gone. God knows what she�s had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I.. Tight security. No guns. Real plus. Jesus, Ethan. Good for you. What�s going to make him do that? ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War. No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself. Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>. The son-of-a- bitch! How <i>dare</i> he? You realize it�s over, you�re an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, you�ve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year. Kittridge, we�ll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time! Yeah. I can sit up straight. I just can't..sit up straight very well. It's not important! I saw who shot me. Ethan, I saw the mole. It was Kittridge. <i>Kittridge!</i> Hey, I showed 'em to you! - so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy. - but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places.. ..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases. They�re covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications. Repeat. Cut all radio communications. Where are you? Abort. That�s an order. No. Abort. I�ve got a shadow. Jack's pinned down Sarah. Should be a second. Keep dancing. If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable? No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You think the plot'll work? Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. He's our guy. Wonderful. Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel. You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years? His wife's got a year old kid. So he says "All right. Who was it? My friend Harry?" She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy." She says it wasn't Sammy. "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou." "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!" Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out. Ethan, you can't burn out. Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here? When you started noticing your short term memory loss. What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev? I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again. You were in Kiev. You tell me. What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too. A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want. After this one.
