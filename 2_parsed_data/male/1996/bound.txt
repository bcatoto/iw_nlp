You planned this whole thing, didn't  you? Where's the fucking money? All part of the business. What choice? Thanks again for this opportunity,  Mr. Bianchinni.  Goodbye. Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky. Sure.  Come on in.  Give me a minute. Who? Oh, he went home to India, but as  far as I know he'll be back. Pretty much.  One day at a time. Good guess. Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this. A favor? Oh, I'm sorry -- Are they really? No, no trouble.  There's other work  to do. Yeah. Truck. '63 Chevy. I don't, really.  I was referred to  him. Do you know him? Caesar is your husband? Thanks. Well, well ... Been awhile, Cork. Five years, two months, sixteen days.   How you doing, Sue? Thanks. Yeah.  Some plumbing, painting and  shit. Not for me, Sue.  I'm straight and  narrow.  I'm just here to get laid  or drunk and hopefully both. Thanks for the beer. Hi. You know ...  that outfit would look  great on my bedroom floor. Nothing ...  yet. I don't think so. When you get tired of Cagney and  Lacey, come find me. Hello?  Oh, hi, Mr. Bianchinni ...   yes, everything is going fine.  I  got the tub drain all cleaned out. What apartment? All right, all right, I guess I could  take a look.  Yeah, you're welcome,  goodbye. Not exactly. He said you lost something. I told Bianchinni I would take a  look.  Is it that sink? Do you have a pot or a bucket? No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do  it.  I did it. Okay, one drink. A beer? No. Curious, maybe. Maybe. What are you doing? Why? You planned this whole thing? You dropped that earring down the  drain on purpose, didn't you? No. Violet? Violet, you home? What's this? What the fuck is this? What the fuck is going on? Oh, shit ... I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ...   it's fucking dark in here. Oh, right, right.  Don mentioned  that to me.  Hi, welcome to the  family. You're helping Rajeev? No.  Rajeev's in India. No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You  know he's a good friend of mine.   |Family, really. That's what Violet said. So, you just got out? What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal.   I know who Don hires.  Did you know  he did time himself? Thirteen fucking years.  See, there  ain't no secrets here. How many'd you do? Five. Not bad.  What for? You're right.  You don't have to  tell me, if you don't want to.  I  just hope you understand you're among  good people here. Come on, come on.  if you understand  what I'm talking about you're going  to take the money.  if you don't,  I'm going to have to worry about  you. Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers. I should be going. What?  How about a drink? My brushes, I have to clean my  brushes.  Thanks, though. Another time. Sure. What are you doing? What am I doing?  I'm fucking up,  that's what I'm doing. Look, I don't think this is a good  idea. Don't apologize, please.  I can't  stand women who apologize for wanting  sex. I can see again. Tell me about it. Caesar's Mafia, isn't he? No. How did you meet him? He's a launderer? How long have you been with him? Five years is a long time. The redistribution of wealth. Isn't that what you wanted to know?   What I did time for? That's what I tell someone when I'm  trying to get them in my bed. My cellmate would say she did her  time for getting caught.  She was  always more honest than me. I started stealing when I was little.   We were piss-poor, which is not an  excuse, just a fact. The first time I remember so vividly.   A bunch of us kids were at Waxman's  Drugstore, when Mr. Waxman, who was  a mean old prick, always worrying  about us robbing him, dropped a roll  of quarters. I can still hear that sound, those  quarters, because right then something  clicked inside of me.  Some instinct  took over and as everyone, including  Waxman, dove down, I reached up and  emptied the cash register. I gave most of the money to my mom.   I told her I found it at the  trainyard.  She was so happy she  cried, calling me her lucky charm.   Fifteen years later, I guess my luck  ran out. Sometimes I tell myself that I didn't  have a choice, that stealing was  surviving.  Usually I can admit that's  bullshit.  I did it because it was a  way out.  It was easy and I was good  at it, real good. I don't usually talk this much.  I  guess I have been rehabilitated. I guess I wanted to. So am I. Nothing. Shit, here we go. If there is one thing I can't stand  about sleeping with women, it's all  the fucking mind reading. I'm not afraid of anything. I know!  You can't understand, because  we're different, Violet.  We're  different. How can you sit in that bed and say  that? Let me guess.  This is where you  tell me that what matters is on the  inside.  That inside you, there is a  little dyke just like me? Is that what her daddy tells her? What are you saying?  That you don't  have sex with men? For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard  you!  Thin walls, remember? What the fuck was it? What was it then? What about that guy this morning? Don't tell me, you're a workaholic. I suppose he just wants to watch. I think so, too. Shit. Shut the fuck up!  You piece of shit! You're going to tell us!  You're  going to fuckin' tell us!  just a  matter of fuckin' time! Where is it?  Where the fuck is it?! You shit!  You piece of shit! Did that hurt?  News flash, fucko:  I'm just getting started. You got nerve trying to fuck us!   Nobody fucks me!  Nobody fucks my  father!  Nobody!  Nobody! Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making  too much noise. You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet! Here, put this in his mouth. Prick!  I can go all night!  All  night! What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one  of the good towels. Why?  'Cause you know him? You women are so fucking sensitive. But I don't want you to go.  I like  you here.  You know this isn't easy  for me, either. Now why don't you go watch some TV  or something? Are you okay, Violet? Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You  know how I feel about that fucking  psycho. Caesar, didn't I tell you to get  something? Sure, Mickey.  Sure. You shouldn't have to see this.  Why  don't you get out of here?  Go for a  walk. Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle  Caesar.  You just get out of here,  okay? Thanks, C.  Now let's end this thing. Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay. Prick. Shelly, I'm going to ask you ten  times.  You understand?  Ten times. One.  Where is our money? Aw ...  Christ. Violet?  Are you all right? Come on.  Let's go. Excuse me. Draft beer and a TNT. Even though he knew about you? He was in love with you, right? Sounds like he wanted to get caught. Mickey? For what? What choice? Not here. How much money? Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do  you have any idea what you are saying?   You are asking me to help you fuck  the mob. These people are serious, Violet.   If you want to know how serious, ask  Shelly.  They're worse than any cop  because they have lots of money and  no rules.  You fuck them, you've got  to do it right. I am, but ... All right, let's say for the moment  that I believe everything you are  saying. I didn't say that, but since you  did, let's say that you are.  It  would have been easy to set Shelly  up.  You could have got him killed  knowing that Caesar would bring the  money to the apartment. All you would need to keep yourself  clean would be someone unconnected,  someone like me. I'm just making a point.  You have  no idea what you're asking.  How  much trust two people need to do  something like this. For me, stealing is a lot like sex.   Two people that want the same thing  sit in a room and they talk, they  start to plan and it's like flirting,  a kind of foreplay, because the more  they talk about it, the wetter they  get. The difference is, I can have sex  with someone I just met, someone I  hardly know, but to steal I need to  know someone like I know myself. I think ... We're going to find out. But first, I want to see this money. Don't worry.  It ain't mine. It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable! Goddammit, look at this shirt!  It's  ruined! It started when Shelly took us to  the money.  I tell you, Mickey Malnato  knows his shit, he does.  Shelly  takes us right there. So Shelly's down on his knees and  he's pulling out this bag of money  from a safe in the floor and I'm  staring at it like "holy fuck!" I  mean, look at it -- And all I can think is how the fuck  did he do this when - Bang!  Johnnie  caps him.  Blood sprays everywhere,  all over the money.  We've no idea  if this is even all of it. And right then I go through the roof  and - Boom!  I belt the dumb fuck as  hard as I can.  I didn't care whose  son he was, I just wanted to hit him  again.  Knock some sense into that  dumb son of a bitch. Just look at this mess I got to deal  with. I told them to run it through the  cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans  for it because he's coming here  tomorrow night to pick this shit up. Where the hell's the laundry  detergent? Come to my place in the morning.   Early, okay? ...  no. You said he washed the money? Then what?  Exactly. What? Did he sleep? What sound? And where is it now? Does the case lock? Good. All right, now, tell me about Johnnie. It sounded like he and Caesar don't  like each other. Why? Who is Gino? Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone,  head of the Marzzone family? ...  shit. Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to  pick up the money? And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie  Marzzone? Sweet Jesus. It's perfect. Gino Marzzone is coming to your  apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't  it?  That means Caesar will be ready.   He doesn't want to look like an idiot.   Gino has been there before? What happened? Does Johnnie hit on you? Has Caesar ever seen him? It's getting better and better.   Keep going. What did Gino drink? All right ... I have an idea to make this work. You'll go back and get ready, take  your time, make it real. The more attractive you are, the  more believable it will be. What time did you say they would be  there? Any bodyguards? Fine. At some point Caesar is going to  quit.  I'd guess sometime around  six, making sure he's got time to  get ready. Un-fucking-believable, what this guy  did.  Shelly is one smart-ass  mothefucker, I mean, he was one smart- ass motherfucker. As soon as he is done, you'll be  right there to put a big drink in  his hand. We want him to come down, to relax,  feel in control again. You look good enough to eat. Waiting in the apartment next door. For the shower.  That will be our  signal. When he's done with his shower, you  will go to the bar. You'll get out the Scotch that Gino  drinks. And as you do, the bottle will slip  from your hands.  -- and shatter  against the hardwood floor. An accident. What happened?! V!  What the fuck was it?!  Violet? V, what?  You can't hear me? Oh, fucking Christ ...  You gotta be  kidding me! Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww  goddammit! There's no time. When you open the door, I'll be there. He won't. Trust me, Violet. If he does ... Then I won't have a choice, will I? When I'm inside, I will get the money. I'm going to need something ... ...  to fill the case. Yeah, you should hide it near the  desk before you leave. At that point -- There is no going back. The same way I'll know that you went  to Scotch.  Trust. Not Caesar. Because of what you are going to  tell him.  You have to make it as  real as you can.  The moment you  open the door with the Scotch in  your hand, you will be covered, and  that moment is the most important  moment in the plan. If it's real enough, he'll believe  it, because deep down he'll want to. What are you talking about? What are you, drunk? No!  They're still on their way. Why? What? It couldn't have been. It's impossible! But Gino's plane doesn't get in for  another half-hour. If Caesar hates Johnnie like you  say, then the second he opens the  case he'll know, in his gut, that  Johnnie just fucked him.  He'll  realize that he has no choice.  He  can't touch Gino or Johnnie.  There's  only one way out. He'll have to run. You'll be clean and we'll be rich. Thank you. Every job like this has moments where  things don't go so well and everyone  starts thinking about their own ass.   It's in those moments that everything  comes together or falls apart. I had a partner and she fucked me. I think we're going to find out. No no no no ... ...  I've been set up. That fuck!  That rat-fuck!  Little  shit rat-fuck! Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your  fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like  I hate him! I hate that little fuck!  I hate  him!  I hate him!  I should've done  him! So what?!  So fucking what?  Use  your head, Violet.  The money is  gone.  Gino is coming here to get  it.  You think he's going to believe  me if I tell him his piss-hole son  stole it!  Is that what you think?   I don't.  You know what I think?  I  think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in  the brain.  That's what I think! I know what he wants me to do.  He  wants me out of here.  He wants me  to run. If I run, then everyone will think I  took the money and he walks away  with two million clean. God, I can see him right now driving  to get Gino.  I can hear him laughing,  fucking laughing, laughing at me. Laughing at me!  Laughing at me! Don't touch me! Just leave me alone!  I got to think! Got to think this through ... Violet, please! Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just  leave me the fuck alone!  Please!   Leave!  Now! What happened? That's okay, as long as he believes  it was Johnnie. It's all right, Violet.  It's working.   All we got to do is wait him out and  see what he does. That means he probably will kill  Johnnie. Listen, if he doesn't run, all you  have to do is break down, go to your  bedroom and pack some things, start  crying, saying you love him but you  can't do it.  You're sorry but you  have to leave and just walk out. We're almost there, Violet.  just  hang on. I got it!  I know what I got to do!   I got to get the money. No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to  do is get it back. He didn't have that much time.  He  had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's  got it with him.  I bet it's in the  car. He didn't see you, did he? See, right now he doesn't know that  I know, that's why he put the paper  in the case.  He wants me to hand  the case to Gino.  Then there is no  doubt it was me.  Gino will put a  bullet in me himself.  But it ain't  going to happen.  I won't let it!   Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not  like this!  No way! What are you doing? You can't leave. I need you ... Violet, I won't let you leave. If you're not with me, Violet, then  I have to assume you're against me. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe  you dropped the Scotch by accident.   Maybe you didn't. It would have been so easy to let  him in as you went out. I've seen the way he looks at you.   He's always wanted you.  Maybe two  million dollars finally bought you. I'm sorry, Violet, but it has to be  this way. I hope you understand.  I want to  trust you, I want to believe you,  but I don't have any other choice. You sure you don't want a drink? You shouldn't have hit me. You want to get into this now? No, no, Caesar.  Not now. Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this  girl, or I find out! You are as radiant as ever, Violet. Glenlivet, right, Gino? I'll have whatever Violet's drinking. Then neither will I. Caesar, make that two TNTs. Salud, eh.  Roy, Violet, Pop, Caesar. No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones.   Not now. Pop? Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk  now.  You too, Johnnie. Caesar, look at me.  Johnnie tell me  what happened.  Caesar, you gotta do  me a favor, a personal favor.  For  me, eh?  You gotta start respecting  Johnnie the way you respect me.  You  understand?  Good. And you, Johnnie.  You gonna stop  acting stupid.  You gotta earn this  respect that Caesar's gonna give.   You understand?  Good.  Done.  Now,  where's my money? We know how this was done, eh? Yeah, I know. It won't happen again, eh? Good. Done.  We go now. Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours  until your plane leaves. Caesar! So Caesar, what did it total out at? Two point one seventy-six. Unbelievable.  Can you believe that,  Violet? Hey, Johnnie ... Come on, Pop, all I want to know is  one thing.  Just one thing after he  made such a big deal out of it.  I  bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it,  Caesar? What's that, Johnnie? The money I bet it was nothing to  get it clean, after you made such a  fucking big deal ... Johnnie, what did I say? Pop, this is important to me.  It's  a simple question.  if he would just  answer the question, that's the end  of it. Where is this going, Johnnie? Just admit it, Caesar. Admit what? That you overreacted.  That you lost  it.  Not me.  It was your mistake. All right, Johnnie, you want to play  it this way, I can play it this way.   You want to know who made a mistake,  why don't you open the case. Shut up, Violet!  This is between me  and Johnnie. You want to do this now, let's do  it.  Open the case.  Open the fucking  case. That's right, I know.  I fucking  know. Know what? Open the case! All right!  Where's the key? You don't need a key. How the fuck can I open it? The same way you did before. What are you talking about? There you go, Johnnie. Get me another. What the ... Don't!  Don't fucking move! Caesar?  What is this? Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son! What the fuck? You don't think I'll do it, do you? I think you're fucking crazy! Where is it? Where's what? The money! Caesar, I don't know what you're  thinking here, but if you don't put  down that gun -- Sit down! Caesar! Gino, your son stole this money to  set me up and I can prove it.  Violet! Tell them!  Tell them! This isn't happening ... The next one blows off your dick. You're a dead man!  A fucking dead  man! Where is it? Enough! No, Gino! You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know  who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You  understand? Sit down, Gino! No, Caesar, gimme the gun. Stay away! We're family, Caesar. No! Gimme the gun. I can't.  I can't. Give it to me. Good man. This is an emergency! I had to do it, Violet.  You saw it.   I had no choice.  It was Johnnie.   That lying fuck.  He made me do it. You lying rat-fuck.  You think you  can set me up?  Is that what you  think?  You stupid fuck. I'm a dead man?  I'm a dead man?   Guess again, fuck-face.  Who's dead?   Who's the dead lying rat-fuck?  Take  another guess, take another fucking  guess! ...  maybe three hours. What do you think we're going to do?   We have to find the money. Once we have the money, then none of  this ever happened. No I didn't.  Not if his body  disappears and not if the money is  still here.  Then they never showed  up. I don't know.  We may never know,  but I'm going to guess it was a job,  maybe the Karpoli family. All part of the business. We just got to find the money.  Once  we do, everything is going to be all  right. Fuck. They're just cops.  Stall them as  long as you can. Answer it! This is the police, ma'am. We had a report of gunfire, so if  you could -- No joke, ma'am.  Please open the  door. Ma'am, you have to open the door. Get me a wet towel. If you're thinking about doing  something stupid, remember I just  killed Gino Marzzone.  You understand  what that means? See?  We're for real. You did the right thing. Hey, hey, Chicago's finest. How's it going tonight, fellas? Pretty good, sir. Huh?  I'm sorry, I can only hear in  this ear. I'm Caesar and this here is my Violet. Violet said something about gunshots? Yes, sir, a neighbor in the building  called in. I think we know what happened. It was probably just the television. The television? Honey, why didn't you say something?   Turn it off. Fuck, this happened before.  It's  this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The  batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm  sorry. It's all right, sir. No big deal. Hey, can I get you guys a beer? Not on duty, sorry. Oh, right. But, uh, would you mind if I used  your bathroom? Yeah, why not?  It's right there. Thanks. I'm going to make myself a drink, if  that's okay? Go right ahead, sir. This is a beautiful place. Is this a condo? Okay, let's roll. Try to keep the extra batteries for  your aid around. Good idea. Let's go. ...  shit. Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! Get in. Get in!  It's got to be at his house.   That's the only other place it could  be. Violet!  Now! Two million dollars, Cork ...  Two  million dollars ... Okay, I come in ... I've got the money ... I can't wait to see the look on  Caesar's face when he finds out. Now I don't have much time ... Got to put it someplace safe ... ...  put it ... ...  got it ... Where did I put it? Where's my fucking money?!  Fucking  cocksuckers!  Where the fuck is it?! Ow. Where, then? We're going to need some time. Yeah? Hey, Mickey. Caesar?  What the fuck time is it? Mick, I know it's late, but there is  a problem.  They haven't shown up  yet. What?  They ain't there? No.  I don't know where they are.  I  even called over at Johnnie's, but  no answer. Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see  what I can do.  Don't go anywhere,  okay? Okay, sure, Mick. Caesar, you still got the money? Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money.   I'm staring right at it. Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you. I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in  Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic  bags ...  tape and rope ... I'm still here. You don't quit on me, Violet, and I  won't quit on you. I know, Violet.  I know. It's why I'm still here. Violet? Who was that? Who the fuck was that? Was that Mickey?  Did you call Mickey?   Did you?! Mickey?  Is that you? Who is that?  Who is over there?!   Tell me! Drop the fucking gun or die! Drop it! Turn around. You!?  Holy fucking Christ!  You  gotta be kidding me! Wake up!  Come on, you fucking dyke! Wake up! Good. I know everything now so I don't  want to hear any "I don't know"  bullshit, you understand? God, I should have seen this coming!   The second I met you, I knew it.   Everyone knows your kind can't be  trusted!  Fucking queers make me  sick. But you tried to fuck the wrong guy.   And I swear to you that I'm going to  kill you for it. Where is the money? Shut up, Violet! Violet! Now, where the fuck is my money? Lick me. Where is it? Either pull the trigger or get that  thing out of my face. Stupid cunt! Don't try to tell me what to do. Shut up, Violet. Shut the fuck up! What did you do to her?!  This isn't  my Violet! What did she do to you? You ungrateful bitch!  You had nothing  before I met you.  You were nothing! Who gave you this place?  This  apartment? Who gave us all of this?  I did!  I  gave you everything!  I gave you  this life!  I made you, Violet.  I  saved you. I saved you. You betrayed me! I had to.  You made me. Shut up! Okay, you want business, I'll give  you the fucking business. I'm going to make you beg just like  Shelly did.  Just like Shelly! Don't be sorry.  Help me. Oh, no no no. Hey, Violet, you remember these? I'm going to start with her so you'll  get a good idea what's coming. I'm going to ask you where the money  is.  Every time you don't give me an  answer, I'm going to cut off one  finger. No. When I reach ten, then I'll start  with you. Where is the money? ...  Mickey. I said where -- No!  I'll tell you! It's over there in the empty  apartment. I put it inside one of the paint  drums. I promised I would kill you. You can't kill me yet. Why? I could be lying. You're going to wish to God you hadn't  done that. Fuck. Son of a bitch ... Mickey will get in.  I know he will. Violet.  I can kill you right now if  that's what you want.  If you want  to live, then you have to help me.   I need you to make Mickey believe  that everything is normal. Tell me, do you want to live? Good girl. Jesus Christ! Holy fuck, Mickey!  You scared the  shit outta me. What is this?  what are you two doing,  sneaking in here with your peckers  in your hands?  You gonna do me,  Mick?  Is that it? No, Cease.  There was no answer. I thought I heard someone knocking. I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I  guess you couldn't hear me on account  of being in the shower. Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was  so wound up about Gino, she was trying  to help me relax. That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish  someone would help me relax. Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get  you a drink.  Sit down, Lou. We was worried about you, Cease. Me?  Why? We went over to Johnnie's place just  to check it out and it was busted  up, Bad. I started thinking maybe it's about  the money so I call you, but all I  get is the busy signal.  I figure  the phone is off the hook, that's  why I come rushing over here. Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a  fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't  it? Hey, if Violet was helping me relax,  I'd probably do the same thing. Cease, can I ask you something? Yeah. Why'd you move all the furniture  around? Let me guess.  That was Violet's  idea, too. Actually, yeah, she was nervous about  Gino coming, wanted everything to  look right.  You know women, Mick. Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid  things, don't they. Is that the money? Yeah, that's it. That fucking Shelly.  I gotta hand  it to the guy, but Jesus, if I were  him I would have bailed a long time  ago.  I mean, how much money does a  man need? I remember I was just staring at all  this goddamn money, Shelly down on  his knees, and the next thing I know,  Johnnie just blows his head off. What a fucking mess.  Johnnie's  laughing his ass off and that's when  Caesar lost it and - Boom.  He  coldcocked him.  Fucking coldcocks  Johnnie Marzzone. Hey, Caesar, where's the key? The key, yeah, the key's in my pants  in the bathroom. Fuck it, I don't need the key. I didn't need a key to get in here,  did I? Who the hell could that be? You gonna answer it? Hello? What? Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've  been going crazy over here, Gino! It's Gino!  It's Gino! Where in the hell is he? They were in a car accident. They're all fine.  Just bruises and  shit. Un-fucking-believable.  I called  those highway patrol dumb fucks. Ssh!  I can't hear Gino! I'm listening. Yes, I understand. Sure, Gino, sure. St.  Mary's off the Kennedy, sure.   Okay, Gino. Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They  were in a car accident. I think everything is okay. They're at St.  Mary's in the waiting  room. I can't fit them all in my car so  give me your keys.  You drive my  car, Lou. Sure, Mickey, sure.  Violet! Go grab my car keys from my pants in  the bathroom. Please, help us out, Mickey wants to  get going. They might want to go straight to  the airport and back to Miami, so I  better take this. You got the key? Oh yeah.  Violet! Violet! Violet! Thanks, V. Call me as soon as you get him. Leave your phone on the hook. Now that's teamwork. You know he would have done you,  too. I said I'd let you live and I will. Maybe. Time to find out if the dyke was  stupid enough to lie. Yes! No! Violet! Fuck! Goddammit, Violet!  Stop!  Now! Oh, you bitch.  You fucking bitch. Violet? All these years and you still don't  know me, Violet. But I know you. What are you going to do, V?  Shoot  me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't  think so.  I'll tell you why.  If  you had it in you to pull that  trigger, you would have done it a  long time ago.  If I was you, I would  have killed me the minute I brought  the money home.  But you didn't and  I know why, because you don't want  to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you?   No, I know you don't. I told you, the family doesn't want  the police around.  We want to take  care of it ourselves and we will.   I'll find him.  I swear I will. Sure you're going to be okay?  I  mean, if you're having second  thoughts, my offer still stands. Hey. How'd it go? I guess we should get out of here. Thought we might need a getaway car. You know what the difference is  between us, Violet? ...  Me neither.
