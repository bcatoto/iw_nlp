Scale the -- Dignan, I -- What? Dignan, I -- How? You're kidding. What's he in for? So how is it in there? We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs. Behind Bob's house. Oh, I'd say about -- It belongs to Bob's uncle. Nothing. Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he? We're not sure. We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed. Pretty much everything. I'm not kidding. Yeah. I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house. Like amnesia. Dignan, it's too late. There's not enough time. What are you talking about? What? Come on. You're kidding. Wait for Kumar. What are you doing? I don't know. It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm. Careful. Check his pulse. Get against the wall! Freeze! It's going back down. It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted. I don't know. I've got a great view up here. I can see all the -- Not at all. The place is totally deserted. I'm in position, Scarecrow. OK. Roger. Uh-huh? We all set? You're all clear. Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow. So do I. Yeah. As a girl. Do you like Inez? He was a nice guy. I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened. I don't want to be too much of a liability. I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow. Or I might end up with a broken nose. Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one. Yeah. It's pretty good. I did. Eleven fifteen. I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy. Shit, Dignan. Easy, Dignan. It's OK. No, Dignan. This isn't -- He doesn't want to fight. Dignan. Take it easy. He seems pretty good. You could give somebody a concussion. What time did he say to be here? What exactly is this place? Freezers? Who's Mr. Henry? What's Hinckley Cold Storage? What is it? You really hit a guy with a bottle? Sure. Who's in the car? When'd you get back? Shut up! I know that. But -- Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper. She needed it. $383. I had to give some to Inez. I know. We've got sixteen dollars. Our money situation is not good. I'm not. But there's -- I think we better go home. No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram. Yes, I do. Bob taught me. I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us. Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't. Shh. I don't know, Dignan. I just -- What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that. I don't think we can do that. What? We need a car. Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk -- I wish I'd been there. I can't believe he just jumped you. Why don't you come with us. We're going over to this bar if you feel like going. I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan. If you say so. Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't. Well, I didn't do it, did I? He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go. You were asleep. This morning. That's a long time to be in jail. He went back for his brother. Maybe he just went to the store. Where was it parked? But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died. After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again. This was in fourth grade. Don't worry about it, Bob. Bob? As long as he gets out OK. No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on. She's from Cuba. On the left. No. Not really. Inez speaks a little. No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English. What. What's the matter? Sure. Inez, this is -- This is Inez. Carmen. Anita. I thought you guys went to get your hair cut. No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that. Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right? Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up. It's not a plan. It's just -- I know. But once you get inside you're home free. It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it. Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts. Bob? OK. Go ahead. I'll just say it. Don't call me spoiled, Dignan. You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan. In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E. They obviously weren't designed for racing. Look at the treads on those. Dignan, those aren't running shoes. I keep it for emergencies. I don't want to use it. Because my mom gets the bill. I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan. Don't even say it, man. He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do. What do you think? Like he would find Dignan. One day. Like he meant it. What about what that guy said? Holy shit. Is that the manager? There's another stocker, right? Where's the manager? Calm down. Take a deep breath. Dignan! Stop! Dignan, calm down. No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours. Nothing. Go ahead. You think we're going to be chased? Just turn right here. Is it back in? But he didn't say anything. Eight dollars. Five, seven, eight dollars. It had an alarm. That sets it off. Dignan, it's got an alarm. Yeah, I saw it. That's not what I meant, Dignan. How was I ridiculing you? Where are you going? Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that? That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her. The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch." But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins? It's got a V-8, Dignan. She's really kind of hot. Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible. Who knows? That's why I filed it down. That's true. But what if they change the locks? Did you see what I meant about the window? No. This is he. He says. This is he. The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name. As part of his plan. I don't know why. No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones. He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode. Dignan, it's -- Right. The blond guy. Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser. Why'd you want to help us? Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry? Yeah. This is good. Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry? No. Bob did. Death. Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man. I don't want to die. Me? That sounds like Dignan. How'd he do? Did Dignan take the test? It feels good. That was a test? What do you mean? And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend. I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But -- What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person. I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe -- So do I. You mean a safecracker? I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage. You mean like techniques? Grammar. Thanks. It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle. Thanks. Nice to meet you. Temporarily. His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account. Who's got the car keys? Jesus, Bob. Let me see it. Did you drop it? What are you doing? Sure. Nothing. I was just asking. You OK, Bob? Give him a second. Yeah. Let's keep it -- Let's not even talk about it. Was Future Man adopted? Well, because you guys don't look alike. Were you adopted, Bob? I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality. Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper. Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend. At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days. I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank. It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down. Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea. No, I don't mind. Yes. You just got to stick with it. You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game. Why not? Bob, where you going? Is that OK? And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right? How long are they going to hold him? He looked too shaken-up. OK, Dad. Nobody does. Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil. Where you going? I hope not. There's a million places to hide around here. What was that? See you, Bob. Yeah. He said that. Let them fight. You could make your own cinnamon toast. Could you grow cinnamon? Hector woudn't do anything. In your backyard? How do you protect them? What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the -- Did you ever steal a car before? Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future. Future Man. God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does. What? What? God, yes. Like silk. Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States? Were you born in Mexico? It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you. Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms? Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you? How do you say nineteen? The front stairs. What do you mean? Abdul-Shabazz? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Yeah. Nice to meet you, Applejack.Where were you? Where'd they come from? Feel this. I can knock a man out with a six inch punch. Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz. S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco? Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery? I hear you're a good thief. You're Anthony? What? You don't celebrate til it's over. I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet. Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac. We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him. What's he doing here? That's your friend Anthony? Is that him? Is that Buckethead? That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail. Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.It's in the driveway. We think Mr. Henry maybe -- Yeah. I didn't do anything. No. My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on. No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake? No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean? Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch. Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail. It was stupid. Jesus Christ! No. No. I wasn't adopted. Why do you say that? Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell. Why were you drawing the Holy Mary? Sixty days? That's pretty complicated for a senior prank. I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. You think I'm improving? Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time. I'm not playing any more golf. What? Anthony, I -- I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail. You think he got my license plates? Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car. I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now. Move. Phil probably provoked him. Where's he going? Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy. What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them. You'll probably have them the rest of your life. See you. Are you serious? Let them fight. I don't know. Sure, I guess. But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark. It's private property. Plus I have Hector. Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening. Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive. Who? The one and only Little Richard. Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets. Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts. Are you a fag? Wait a second -- Hold on -- Do they let you -- Do you have your own cell? Do you have your own room? What's that? Applejack drove. He's stuck between two floors. The elevator broke. I didn't think there was an alarm. I think so. He's having a heart attack or something. I couldn't hear anything. It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here. Everything OK? Scarecrow? I know it, man. Hang on. That's OK. That's OK. I didn't have any choice. I don't want to fight you, Dignan. Bullshit. I never agreed to that. Man, I don't want to go into this. I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to -- It's too bad about what happened on the road. Come on in. What you been up to? Hey, Dignan. How's it going? Dignan. Let's go. It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan. What's his name? What is it? You don't even know his name. His name's not Future Man, Dignan. Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God -- Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt. Give me the keys, Dignan. Watch me. I'm going back. Come on, Dignan. Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there. Well, obviously, we got to go back. We'll have to see when we get back. I don't know. I was just going to use it to see how much I had. The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana. They also found my two beam scale in the garage. Well, the marijuana crop is a good start. They said he's a drug dealer. The weed. My brother's in jail. See you in a little while. You're the one who kept saying ram him. It's registered in my mother's name. Is he chasing us? He wouldn't move. There were more than that. I told you they were there. That's true. That would give me nightmares. I don't want to talk about it. You really think he'll remember you? Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag! How much is there? Did we get it? This is natural. What happened? What are you doing? That's too bad. His name was Swifty? He electrocuted someone? Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you? He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him. I paid for it. I just want to see how much bullets it takes. I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute. OK. That's my responsibility. I'm going to take a look at this. Let's just go. Maybe she turned. Well, don't blame me. I told you. No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic. I warned you, Dignan. I told you he's crazy. I can't believe you said that. Yeah, but don't tell anybody. Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants. Good question. You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard. As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed. I'll just drive my car. It's true, Dignan. Yes. I did. Can you use a coaster. If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one. That never would of -- My brother. They are. No. I'm not allowed to drive those. Well, what do you think? I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me. John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home. Yeah. Hey, Clay. I'm working on it. No. I didn't run away. I went out of town. He said what? I'm trying. Hey, Jackson. How's it going?Ground defense. Social issues. Crime prevention. 26 weeks.Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready? Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember: Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll -- When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard. Shhh. Wait for my instructions. No. I'm not. I think I may have found a way out of here. He stole a tractor. What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to. Does it float? Where? How big is it? You're living on a sailboat? What do you mean? Why? You think Applejack knew? The grandfather clock? What'd he get? You got to be kidding me. He did? So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything? Can't remember shit. CRS. I don't think so. Yes, there is. Let's get organized. I'll get him. I'll see you there. I'll see you there. Applejack's stuck in the elevator? Come on, Kumar. Let's go. Come on. Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him? Where's Kumar? Who tripped the alarm? Help me move him. Nobody move! Applejack! What's happening? Who did that? What the fuck is that? What's happening? What's going on? Check the fucking elevator. It's moving. Stand by, Bird Dog. Good. It's supposed to be. Any activity? Take your second position. Hang on a second. Roger. Go ahead, Bird Dog. Yes. I do. As a person? He was all right. Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared. I don't think you will. Did that hurt? Next week we'll be drinking pi�a coladas. It's like we've finally arrived. God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry. OK. Mark that down. OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it? I'm sorry, Bob. What the fuck are we doing out here? No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault. Get out of the way. Bob! What do you think? Let me feel that. Right now. Right. Freezers. Imported foods. You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up. Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information. It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage. I want you to look at this. Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way. That's Applejack. You want to meet him? Ah. Couple days ago. What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the -- You're in love with the fucking housekeeper! That's what she is! A $500 tip! For the housekeeper! You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem? How much? Where's the rest? Sixteen dollars. That's not correct. You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred -- You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to -- Don't panic, Anthony. Bob taught you how to get electrocuted. You don't know how to hotwire. No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better -- Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans. She doesn't need to know. I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and -- Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she? I have an idea for that. I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place. Would of been nice. Can you hand me those french fries. OK. No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later. Well, the world is a little bit colder today. If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped. I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead. So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just -- If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself? He told you and you let him do it. Where was I? When'd he tell you? We said 48 hours. He took his stuff. He's gone. I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character. That coward. Son of a bitch. Right here. He's gone. He stole the car. Yes... It's true. They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life. Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead. See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him. See, now we've got a plan. Obviously. That's a given. Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road. He needs to hire an attorney. No kidding. Which one was that? They don't? Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name? What the fuck is going on here? May I have a word with you, please? Jerry. And this is my associate Cornelius. Hi. No. We didn't. Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not? Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car. True. Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over. Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit. Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony. No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know. You owe me fifty bucks. On your marks... Get set go. I'll say it. You were spoiled rotten. That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled. Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes. Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those. What about them? Yes, they are. See if mine are in there. Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that... Well, then cut it in half. She's not going to notice, Anthony. Why not? Can I get that credit card from you? I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got -- Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved. What's wrong with him? Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you. Yeah. I swear to God. In a very quiet voice. Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you. We got it. We got it. Unlock that door. Check the aisles. We know there's another stocker. Where's the other stocker? You're right. You're right. You're out! I'm not working with either one of you! Anthony, give me the fucking gun! Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony! That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say -- OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be -- Loop around real fast. Yeah. Hang on a second. That's not bad. Holy shit. What'd I tell you? Yeah, I heard that. No, just do it real quick. I'll meet you down there. I don't think so. Just reach on in. I'm lookout. Did you see that? You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying. I don't appreciate you ridiculing me. Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it. Every valuable item in the house was on that list. I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that. Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at. What do you think the cops have? She's an attractive older woman. See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be -- Would they do that? Kind of. Except we've already got the keys. This is he? What does Starsky say? See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream. Why? I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony. Plus where's Huggie Bear? OK. That's wrong. Making Hutch David Soul? What color hair does he have? Bob! Get back in position! True. Well, this isn't really a party per se. Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack? Wait. Did he see us? Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going. Yeah. That's Anthony. Wait a second. We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this. Just settling an old score. You might say revenge. There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand. Now! Here we go. I don't really want to talk about it, Bob. No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl. We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells. That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit. I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease. Run. Run. Let's go. Where's Applejack? Take him to the car, Bob. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that? Is he breathing? Let's go! What's wrong with Applejack? Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position. Stand by. Bird Dog? Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there? Yeah? Jesus Christ. Come on, Bob. Look. We want you on the job. I'm sorry, Bob. It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother. Come on! All right! Backyard! Right now! Bob, you're lying! You said 48 hours! I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob? Right. It was extremely stupid. Yeah. It is. Not a whole lot, Bob. Not bad. Anthony. Bad news. You've got a beautiful walk, Bob. That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out. OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid. Just get in the car, Bob. Yes, I do. I know it's not. Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that. Don't threaten me, Bob. I can't do that, Bob. Good luck, since I got the keys. Not in that car you're not. Don't "Come on, Dignan" me. This could be a trap. Bob, that makes no sense. What do you mean get back? Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional. How long has he been in there? So tell them the truth. What do you use it for? Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale. That could be anybody's. I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man? But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man? What are you talking about? You can go first, Bob. Bob. Are you coming? What the fuck possessed you? I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates. I don't know. Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for? In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten? So it's my fault? Way to go, Bob! Bob, I've got nightmares. I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!" Bob, will you please listen? No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose. No. I was calm. Don't count it. Be cool, Bob. Be cool. Make that light. That's good. Keep it at forty. Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural. I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose. You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did. Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know. It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated. You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year. Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. God DAMMIT. What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead! Bob. That's your domain. Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway. I think we might of scared her. Where'd she go? I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her. I know that now. He's a fucking psycho. You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild. The guy is fucking insane. What did I say? What was that all about? You're paranoid, Bob. If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them? Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob. How much could you grow? Realistically. Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car? OK, Bob. You stole a Trans-Am. What are you talking about, Bob? Let's cut the bullshit. He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare. So who's going to know? I thought your parents were in Italy. Not even for emergencies? I don't know, Bob. What about one of those? Did you hear that? Hand to hand combat? And what does that cover? How long do you have to go? Well, I think -- Yes. We're just going over a few things. Is he good? Oh, yeah. The grammar? What do you mean grammar? I don't know. Are you in, Anthony? This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry. What can we do? What's the story? He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember? Don't worry about it. Who? Applejack? You got that? Where is he? Where is Rob? In the cash register. Step away from the door. Well, I left some money in there. Where's that guy going? It's locked. Mr. Henry? Right. Fuck you. You a Hoto. No. Just pool. What? Guess I'll get another Tecate. I don't know. Got a little lucky. Sure. No, my friend knows her. No. I just have short hair.I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section. Where? He left his sweater. We're closed, sir.Right. I'm sorry. You've got a reputation to think about. I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission. I might have mentioned it. Fancy seeing you here, Bob. Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting. How's that 700 bucks coming? Nice to meet you. Well, we'll see you later, Bob. What? John Mapplethorpe. How are you. Hi.He said you ran away from home. Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home. This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart. You keeping out of trouble? How you doing, Bob?Can't get it. It won't... Why did he go that way? Where did he go?No, it's not. Come on in! How's the weather down there? No. Me no Hoto. Tecate? You Hoto? Fight. You know. Si. Tecate. You like to fight? She is a good looking woman. Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita? You a good pool player. You like Chicanos? She Chicano, yes? Is that your chiquita? Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me. Absolutely. We're renegades from despair. It's an esoteric journey. But you're thieves. It's what you are. I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend. Anthony, I'm petrified. Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome. I love palindromes. The fear of death, The pain of consciousness. Did you mix this martini? Exactly. Woah. Are you afraid? No, that door over there. I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die? Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses. Yes, he did. How does that feel? Take a deep breath. The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score. Congratulations. You passed the test. Hold it. As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business? You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it. Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods up here. I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan? Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan? Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body. Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali. Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job? Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that? Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success? The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar. You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent. It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this. That's a sharp jacket. This is my business manager, Rowboat. No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this. Why? You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow? Join the party, fellas. He's damn good. You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged. Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys. The basic grammatical rules of robbing. Is he in? This is no good. Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack. Who are you?
