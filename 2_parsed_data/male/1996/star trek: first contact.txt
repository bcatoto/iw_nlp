I look forward to reading your report. It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over. Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment. Good hunting. Hayes out. The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own. But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?I believe so. The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow. No. There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range. No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it... Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty... No... no, please... you cannot... Yes... I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated. My creator did not intend for me to experience these things. I wish to... go back to the way I was. I... do not want this... That is not true. They have tried to help me. No. I will not betray my friends. It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure. I do not know what you are referring to. It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference. You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...? Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five. According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063. The vortex is collapsing, sir. I have helm control. It has entered Earth orbit. Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface. We are approaching the Terran System, Captain. The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective. Dispersive armor is holding. That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals. Who are you? I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed. No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I. I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse... Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer. The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology. So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage. Bag him. We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them. Is it Japanese? How long has he been unconscious? What did you do to the batteries? Outside, around back. Next to the water tank. I told you, there's no -- Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted. "APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing? Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help. Captain, the Enterprise! There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects! The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort. I'm on it... The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive. The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention. Ready to deploy the warp nacelles. Ignore it. We'll be fine. Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark... Entering the upper ionospere... Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms... What's still there? No... the door's too thick. Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go now . Captain -- Tell her to go back to Resurrection. Always am. They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings. It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel. Maybe... Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos. We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing. Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this... This used to be the throttle valve assembly. It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship. It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface. Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched. Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in... I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below. I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something. This must be it. I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters. Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.Initiate pre-ignition sequence. Main bus... ATR setting... I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it. It'll be tight, but we should make it.We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain. Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet? Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp. Absolutely. Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I... Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that. If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana. Not yet. How did Doctor Almack react to that? You actually performed surgery...? I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right? Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got. Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him. I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them. It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history. As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital... It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding. It's Cochrane. I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century. Yes... We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead. Montana. Energize. Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time. Give me a damage report on that missile silo. What year is it? Contact Starfleet Command. Where's the Sphere? What? Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship? Ready quantum torpedo. Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery. Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he? Where? Where's the battery room for the hospital? Juice? Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories. We're crossing the threshold! Their com system must still be down. Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me? One minute to warp threshold... Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second. Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot... Engage. Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading. As they used to say... all systems are go. There's a red light on the second intake valve. Altitude fifty kilometers... Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room... Then we'll just have to assume it's still there... It'll have to wait. Come on. This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence. She's a very... determined woman. Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in. We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed. Phoenix to control. Initiating five minute countdown... mark. Ready to make a little history? Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself? If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them. We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours... There must be some design schematics... blueprints... Can you reconstruct the throttle valve? Picard to Enterprise. Enterprise, please respond. There should be some kind of manual release... I have the password right here. There should be an access hatch nearby... Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive. How serious is the damage? Let's go. Understood. Keep me informed. I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man. From another planet. Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears. There is no invasion... Invasion. What do you want? Something wrong with that? I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst. Yes. I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing. It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer. There's a few of us left. California. San Francisco. Oh... here and there. You know how it is. Yes. Jean-Luc Picard. Oh... yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...? This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary. That's impossible. No... I'm from France. No. It's a lot further than that. I have to... I am not a thief... Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes. We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon. A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like. Some. Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's. We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and -- I'd say you already have. It can't wait until tomorrow... Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important. How did you know about that? Were the two of you... involved? Are you always sucha good judge of character? What makes you say that? What? I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in -- No... but sometimes I feel that way. What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs. I can try. Did you take any other pictures of the rocket? Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric. I'm very sorry. Cochrane? Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that -- Yes, he is. Track their weapons fire. We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line. Life signs? On screen. Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them. Onscreen. Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes. Fire! Go to manual. Intercept course, full impulse. Weapons status? Steady as she goes. Data, set a course for that vortex. Time travel... they're attempting time travel... Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command! Fire. Unless you'd like to stay. Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex? Return to our own time? I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge. Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian. In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship. Life signs? On screen. Report. They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history... Worf... torpedo... now!Ready. Active. Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again. What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect. Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.No, sir. Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back? Yes, sir. Good luck, sir. And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow. As First Officer I should be the one beaming down... Captain? Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line. Looks like they damaged the silo... We're still in Earth orbit. They did it... they assimilated Earth. We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex... Emergency override! Report! Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes! I'll keep that in mind. Right. Just a little queasy... I guess I'd better get it right the first time. Agreed. Options? They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications... Computer -- thermal enhancement. What are they doing? We have to cover both possibilities. We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in. We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective. What the hell is happening, Worf? What? Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible. Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious. Hold that thought. I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll... I remember it made me sick. Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...? Where the hell are they going? All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay. Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg. The Borg. Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship. Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields. Report.What the hell happened down there, Worf? Worf? Is something wrong? Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves? Riker here.I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off. We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done. Data... are you sure you're all right? Did you know her? But how? Western hemisphere... North American continent... Captain...? Population... thirty-five billion... All Borg. Incoming transmission from the Borg. Aye, sir. I have to admit there was a moment there when -- What are you suggesting? To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay... They're bypassing Engineering... Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with? Wil... Data was down there. Someone...? We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's -- They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period... Even Data? Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems? Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana. Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes. Aye, sir. Target locked! Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed. Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface. Hull integrity down to thirty percent... Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position. Aye, sir. Port battery, ready sir! Nothing. We've lost Bridge control! Understood! And Commander, whatever you do... do not vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant. Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship. Are you alright? The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation. You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation. There's only one torpedo left... Destroy the deflector dish. We have to stop them from sending that message. They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae... They're re-routing the deflector power conduits... They appear to be modifying the deflector dish. To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge. We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data. It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room. A ship-wide decompression has been initiated! I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success. Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes. Commander... we have a problem. Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back. Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room. There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless. Worf to Bridge. What kind of message? Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols... There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials. Target... No response. I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
