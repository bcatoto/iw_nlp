Okay, whatever you want. Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know? Do you wanna go to the van? Yeah. Mm. Hey, what are you doing now? Sounds like a bummer. Any gunshot victims? Your a nurse? You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something? I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit. Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it. A cloud. It's really not about anything. Yup. No I quit. Hey! Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming? Want a beer? Is Pony coming? God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow. See, I wasn't making shit up, man. Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there! Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead! It's bullshit. Look! Look! Yeah, man. That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit. Bullshit. Tim... She's dead? What? What she doin' in the van, man? Hey, man. What? Wait. Hey, man. Y- s-sure it did. Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man. No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say? Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica? I know, man. Oh, and guess who showed up. But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel. Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics... No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus. Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape. I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean... Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady. Yeah. Hey, you know me. Sure. Good. No. Life is too short. She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that. Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze? Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze? Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night. Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet? In the limo!!! Fuck it! You know what we should do? Go to the... Go! So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood. A long, long, long... A long, long, long, long, while. Yeah, a long while. A long, long while. Ah! Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it! Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk. I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan. Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that? Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge! You wanna bet he's with a girl? Sorry. Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh! That's the rock star thing. The dude wants it. Yes! Pony's coming here to the corner?! But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner? Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday! It's your birthday? You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy? Stuck with what guy? Stuck, who? What guy? Huh? Where are you-hoo? And your mom. Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls. Yo, your gettin' me all upset here. Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard. Needs some pizza in his diet. You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in. Hey, come on, man! Limo! Wait, what happened to the tree? Play it! Come on! Yeah. Yeah, right, publicist. Fuck her! Come on, let's go. Ah, you know people there? Hey, man. They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun. Great. Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city. Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man. Wait, so Pony's coming by here? Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend. You're fascist, man. Neofascist. I will. I can come visit? Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A. Yeah? Oh, how did you get burnt-out? Hey! Hey. Yes! Free concert! Buff. Mm, in a horizontal and wet way! So, then, you're, like, available? Shit. Well, that's one way of putting it. Mm. And your like, what else? Your his publicist? Yeah. Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...? Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A. You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay. Good. See you later. Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili. Glad it's okay. Are you talking to me? Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama! No, you don't belong here. We were here before you. You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it! Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors. It's safe, come on. We're your customers. We're not complaining. Hey, we're just having a conversation. Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God. He paid you man. Score! Yeah! Thanks, man! Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright. I didn't want to eat this much, man. A reel? Yes! Yeah. I could. "Closed, closed, closed." But with your music. Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now. Thanks. See man? No man. He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here. Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important. Whoa! I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm... Please. Well, play it, man. Yeah, we're all above that. Oh, So what about her? So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock? No, but I heard it was great. Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!Come on. Inside. Will you stand up for me? Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend. Okay, come on. Time to slow down. What's up guys?Uh-huh. Can you tell me what happened? Two-fifty? They go up?You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result. You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life. Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is. Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony. We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking. It was pretty bad, huh? I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab. Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink? How long were you in there? Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense. In Group? Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"? You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense. Can I have some? I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink. Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black! "Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think? Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck. I don't know. Uh, yeah, she should be coming by. Alright. 'Bye, Buff. No. Guess not. Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then! Oh, really? You wanna go look? No, no, no. Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer. Look, Tim confessed to me last night. She's dead. Buff... She's in the van. Look. Erica is in the van back there. No. It didn't, Buff. Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night? What, they're looking for her? You know? No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble. Buff, can you listen to me for a second? Buff, listen to me. Could you just- No. Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright? No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony? No, no. Uh, last night... Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious. No, I mean, no one. Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright? No, I'm not worried. No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried. No, no, I wasn't trying. No. No, no. You know what? Go with him. Just go with him. So you can do an album cover? ... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on! So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that? Okay. Okay, okay. Watch out for that tree. I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin. No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it. That sounds so depressing. That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon? I'd get bored. You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit. No, he's not with a girl. Jesus Christ. Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff. No, no. No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo. Don't let 'em fight. I don't know. Later. I don't know. Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea. He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna... Yeah. No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday. What? Shut up! Aw... No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets. No, I'm here. Where are you? Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars. Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie. You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile. Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi. Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake. Is that Bee-Bee? Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous. That, that's Indian? He's got a gun. He's got a gun. Just put it down. Will you just put the gun down? They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know? Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you. Just go home, alright? What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off. No. No. I don't know. The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking. You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again. Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser. Because I care, I'm a fucking fool? Why? Because I give a shit? Yes. No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life. You lied to me. They let you out? Oh fuck. Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious? You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her? What'd you do? Well, w-what happened? What? What'd you do? Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out. Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man! Yeah, fuck 'em. What? No. I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit. See ya later. Tim, what are you talking about? No, wait, no, I thought about New York. Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man. I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message. No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright? Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole? Wow, that must be pretty nice there. Sooze wants to see him. No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to... Nobody. Sooze. You don't need to sit next to me right now. Because I'm alienated. Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from. Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much. Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy. I don't know. I think she's breathing. Please? Nazeer what? Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff. No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name? That's right. Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me. I don't know. Why we're just standing here. I gave it to you. What? Just go. Just go. Go. Do your covers and all that shit. Oh, fuck it, man! Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out. Oh, no, no, no. No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say. Well, what about us? Wait. What, what are you saying? To his hotel? Wait, away? Where are you going? Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing? No, no, I have to talk to you. Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out. I, yeah. And I fig- and I figured something out. No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here. But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry. No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know. Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost. No, I just don't feel like it. That's all. No. No, no, no. So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead? FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert! No, I don't. No, I don't. No, I don't. Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down. Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should. I don't know. No, no. Mm-mm. So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better? Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine? Mm-hm. Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground. Nothing. No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal? And? Us. Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York? Sooze. ... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there. I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh... I would've stopped it. Yeah. Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something. It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt? Tim! Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start. Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play? Can I talk? Can I talk here? Let me talk. I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth! Yes, I stand for - No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest. No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit. Hey! One! Name one. Like what? About what? No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate? What are you trying to communicate? Tell us. Oh, well, then you better listen to him. No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent. "The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you. Your sure as hell right about that. Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am. No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life. Yes. Was that supposed to be me? Okay, so maybe later. Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now. Oh! Trim it! I know, I know, I know. God, I haven't seen you all day. I don't know. I don't know. Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes. I'm sorry. I, I gotta... I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly? No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah. No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey. No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know. W-wait a minute, wait a minute. Of course it does. Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special? Yeah, well, that's what I do too. Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you? So who are you? So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house? For a while. Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh... Great. Now? Really? Yeah, they could be songs. Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things. So you think I should? You know, I've thought about that, actually. I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know. Sorry. Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets. The prom. That's funny. Yeah, I crash there. Yeah. Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex. Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh? Yeah. Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall. No, it's not... Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo? Good, man. Hey, Pony.Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of. Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat." You're a drunk and an idiot. In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here. I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay. It's okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself. Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around. Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here. Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go! That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police. Please! Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain. This is private property, my friend. You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty. Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty. He causes problems. He was here earlier. He's drunk. Always two-fifty, my friend. Two-fifty. Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside. This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof! How is she? Look, look, just get off my property. Nazeer Chaudry! Okay. Nazeer, okay? Look, why do you care, huh? Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm? Oh, it's very complicated, huh? You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy. You know, this, what you're doing with your life... Look, your trespassing. Seven-twenty. No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility. This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah. What are you saying? Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming. Get off my roof! Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum! Look Pakeesa... Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police. Get off my property! Look, get down off my property. Please. Look... Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan. You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here. What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man. No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife. Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.I'll be in the car, okay? Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know? Wait, I'll get you some air. You okay, man? You okay? Yeah! I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel? Yeah! You could do it. You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed." You make videos? You know? I remember coming here with my parents. Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh. Hey, thanks, man. No, no, whoa! Don't drop the guitar, man. I just started it. No, no, no, no, no, it's new. See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about... Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that. Oh, thanks. Thanks. Oh, you were there? Erica, you coming? Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water. Um, mother-daughter. Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so... Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band. Funny shit, man. He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class. Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs. We were? I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom. Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home. Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff. Oh, sure. I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back. Hey, where's Erica? Burnfield. No place like it. Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over. Oh, yeah. Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff. George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff? Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food? Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really... You know what I'm saying? Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound? What? I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it. What do you mean? No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier. Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us. Well, not exactly. Yeah, maybe later. Hey! Hey! Yeah. Yeah, really. Yeah. You should show 'em to me. Like songs? What? No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit. So how's college? Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight. Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man? Yeah, good. The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show.

Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on. "It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man. Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life. You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life. Oh, yeah? Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.

They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me. This is my home. Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man. No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick. Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh? You don't know? Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it? Good, good. I, I hope he does. I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless. Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you? Oh, shit. Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool. Wow. You did that for me? You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless. Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit. Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts. Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore. I hit her. Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really... That chick, Erica? No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff. No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em! Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean? Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night.

Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places? Good. That's good. To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom. What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock? Ask your girlfriend. I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib. Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy? Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man. Wow, you're cute when you're angry. Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease. Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV. Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us. Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave? Who were you talking to? If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead? Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land. What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same. Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat. Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem. Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay. You're fucked now, pal! Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay. Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck. Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town! No, this has everything to do with you. I hope you're happy! Ready? Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here! You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on! Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened? Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do. Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself. Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can? Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine. Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem. Camel jockey. Well, what about this? Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right? Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right? Your manager? Yeah? What are you going to do? Hm? No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me. Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?! It's none of my business? Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road? Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to. Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock. She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel. About what? Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright. What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first. I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard? Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel. Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot. Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice. So, like, your dad's a big deal, right? Where do you get your ideas? I'm here. It's not the air force anymore, Scuff I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you? Yeah. Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow? Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel. There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash". Oh that's nice for you. Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole. Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze. Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals. Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas. Hey, your gonna regret this. Fucking drunk, huh? Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head. No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on. Why don't you go back to where you came from? I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac. Seriously? It's a great idea. Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
