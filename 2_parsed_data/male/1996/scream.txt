FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT! Where the fuck did she go? She can't get both of us. I thought she was dead. It's on the table. Get the gun. I'll untie Pops. And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending. What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone... Ready? You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today. Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath. And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid. Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him. It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die. Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn. I was hoping Sid and I could talk. You ready to party hard tonight? Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive. Duh... that's quick. Thanks, butt wart. You did good. How'd you do? You open your mouth and stupidity pours out. No one's saying you did. It's called tact, you fuckrag. No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff. Yes, sir. I just wanted to see her, that's all. I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother. You bitch -- where the fuck are you? Hello? Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out. Jesus... fuck, that hurt. We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something. Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive? We already played that game. You lost, remember? It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE! It's okay. Give me the gun. I'm alright. Gotta... get... help. You don't still think it was me? Yeah... and when I called no one answered. I called my dad. What? Are you serious? What? Sshh... it's okay. Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise. Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre. Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father. Oh Sidney... You lost your mom... So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry. Subtlety, Stu. Look it up. You have to move on, Sid. When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back. It's been a year since she died. Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy? Then what is it? Is there somebody else? Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me. See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember? The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid. Hey, hey, it's just me. I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay... What's that? I'm going... I'm going. No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff. Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television. And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you. It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window. Close call. I'll only stay a sec. You sleep in THAT? I'm sorry. Don't hate me.I'll call for backup. We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here? Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car. I don't think you're so bad. Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious. Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago. NO! I mean... I should probably take just you. Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town. A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road. Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me. Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out. Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose. What brings you out to these parts? Evening, ma'am. I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year. That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person. If you'll excuse me, ma'am. We haven't ruled out that possibil... No, not yet. We're tracking the cellular phone bill. Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice. I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am. You're not supposed to be here, ma'am. Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being. I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye? She's with me. I just wanted to check on things. Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise. A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me. What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law. Hold up a sec... Does mom know? You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene. What are you doing here? Not yet. Afraid not. Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid. You girls ready. I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself. Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas. I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him. Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls. Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything... We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry. He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel? You're sure it was the Hilton? You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit? Yes, sir. She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight. She's with my sister. Should I bring her in? You think he could still be in town? Have you contacted the bureau? Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned? Keeping my eye on Sidney. Yes, sir, sheriff. We haven't located her Dad yet. They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it? That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records. She's tough. Drive by patrol. I was first to respond. He's her boyfriend. We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis. It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.Casey! Casey! Where is she? Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit. Call the police. Casey? Casey? Jesus... That fish smelled strong.About thirty seconds. The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture. What's the plan? But it's so much easier when we make it up. When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge. You want to go live? What? What?Your call. There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live. What door am I at? Answer the question and I will. Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out. Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel. Afraid not. I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer. Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH. Then answer the question. Same category. But you're doing so well. Now for the real question. YES! What's his name? Come on, yes you do. Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters. Name the killer in HALLOWEEN. I'll even give you a warm up question. It's an easy category. Movie trivia. Come on. It'll be fun. Turn off the light. Which is it? Then he dies. Right now. I wanna play a game. That all depends on you. Guess. Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again. His name wouldn't be Steve, would it? I believe you... I'm getting scared. Sure... I thought you didn't have a boyfriend. Or else what? TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE. They'd never make it in time. More of a game, really. NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND? You getting scared? To talk. I told you not to hang up on me. Don't... Don't hang up on me. Wait... I thought we were gonna go out. What do you think I said? I want to now who I'm talking to. Because I want to know who I'm looking at. You never told me your name. Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend? So, you gotta boyfriend? Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary. Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers? Guess. You have to have a favorite. What's your favorite scary movie? Do you like scary movies? Really? What? I only eat popcorn at the movies. You're making popcorn? What's that noise? You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine. Why don't you want to talk to me? I want to talk to you for a second. Wait, wait, don't hang up. To apologize. I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number. Do I? I don't know. What number is this? Who is this? Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again. Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you. Hello Sidney. If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother. Uh-huh. Right here. That's the original part. Your front porch. The question is not who am I. The question is where am I? Maybe that's because I'm not Randy. Are you alone in the house? And why is that? What's your favorite scary movie? Do you like scary movies, Sidney? Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.Sleep tight, sweetie. ...so call if you need me. No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton... I heard screaming. Are you okay?Twice. Working, thank you. Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced. You got it. Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it. Don't shoot. It's me. She's the Scream Queen. No, Sid. Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one. Yeah. There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back." Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit. There goes my chance with Sid. What's Leatherface doing here? We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly. I had 'em hid in the foreign section. It's 1995 -- motives are incidental. You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect. So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition. Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict... Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me? Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him. There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience. Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited. You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead. If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section? Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know. Now that's poor taste. We had a run in the mass murder section. Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox. Besides -- "Takes a man to do something like that." It would certainly improve your high school Q. And are the police aware you dated the victim? Before she dumped him for Steve. That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here. Did you ride past Casey Becker's house? And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too? You rode your bike out there? Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight? Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out. Hold off for now. Just stay close to her. He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney? They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house. There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man. Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed. Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy? She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around. She staying with you? Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know. What about the cellular phone bill? Have to be. The shit she's gone through. How is she? What were you doing out here? Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus... How is everything?I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep. I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'. Odds are -- she'll miss anyway. She looked dead. Still does. No, it's not. That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy. Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel. Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead... Yeah... This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last? That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules. Nope. Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun. And if you get it right -- you die. You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night. Oh yeah. Dude. What are you doing here? You know it. Oh... I was just asking. Why are you always at me? So you gonna try and make up with Sid? Piece of cake. She'll be there. Sorry. Owwww... I didn't kill anybody. Sorry. What? She asked. Come on, Sid. Give me the gun. His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho. I'll be right back. Wanna another beer? I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts? Like you had one. He came to make up. I can cry on cue. I thought everything was checked out. And what would be your motive? Which is you... I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass? She's saving herself for you. So what's his reason? Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend? The why'd the police let him go? It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything. What? You coming tonight? Jesus, this place is packed. I'm gonna gut your ass in a second. What are you saying? That I killed her or something? For about two seconds. Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that. Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive. The official term is "psychotic". It's all part of the game. Guess, I won't be needing this anymore. You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever. Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food. Remember, there's safety in numbers. My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'. And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house. Are you kidding? This is like Christmas. You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up. Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY? I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage. With that set of lungs -- she should be. Where you guys been? We had to start without you. Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you. Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened? Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it. I did. He's full of shit. Because there's no way a girl could have killed them. I don't know, they just did.
