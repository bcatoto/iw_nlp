Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill! Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference. Well, it's not gonna happen! What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'? Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher. That's better. Yes? Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again. Deep and hard. Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands... Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit? You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away? You see what I see, Bork? Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers? Yes. You can never be too careful Bork. Did you give him a full cavity search? Talk ta me, Bork. Dammit!
