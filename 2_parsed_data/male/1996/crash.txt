I'm looking for James. Has anybody  seen James Ballard? You know who I  mean? The producer of this epic. I think I saw him in the camera  department. James? James, are you in there? Could  we please get your stamp of approval  on our little tracking shot? Of course. Be there in a minute. Where were you? Did you come? We were interrupted. I had to go  back to the set... I've been thinking about that, about  you and Karen. Thank you. They consider this to be the airport  hospital. This ward is reserved for  air-crash victims. The beds are kept  waiting. I'll listen for you buzzing over. Is that a gift from Wendel? It has  an aeronautical feel to it. That's going well, then. And her husband? What was he? No smoking, please. Are you this gentleman's wife? Mrs  Ballard? You can stay for this, then. Where's the car? What!? They brought the car here? Have you seen it? It's about time. After being bombarded endlessly by  road-safety propaganda, it's almost  a relief to have found myself in an  actual accident. James Ballard? Yes? Crash victim? Yes. We'll deal with these later. Dr. Remington...? You should have gone to the funeral. What about his wife? The woman doctor?  Have you visited her yet? I can't sit on this balcony forever.  I'm beginning to feel like a potted  plant. Is the traffic heavier now? There  seem to be three times as many cars  as there were before the accident. I thought she might come along.  Handling a car again might be more  tiring than I imagine. You're not envious? No. There's still a patch of blood there  on the road. Did you see it? You were the last one I saw just  before the accident. Do you remember?  We made love. I can drive. I'm not thinking about the crash at  all. It's not here. Maybe the police are  still holding it. Their forensic  people... You'll tear your gloves. I don't think we should have come  here. I'm surprised the police don't  make it more difficult. Can I give you a lift? I somehow find myself driving again. You haven't told me where we're going. The airport? Why? Are you leaving? I take it you're not wearing white  to reassure them. So -- why the airport? Look at all this traffic. I'm not  sure I can deal with it. Are we imagining it? The Road Research Laboratory? Where  they simulate car crashes? Isn't that rather too close...? What is it? Really? What kind of exhibition is  it? You're kidding. You're not jealous, are you? You  have to understand... Helen and I  had this strange, intense...  experience together. 'Don't worry, that guy's gotta see  us!' These were the confident last  words of the brilliant young Hollywood  star James Dean as he piloted his  Porsche 550 Spyder race car toward a  date with death on a lonely stretch  of California two-lane blacktop,  Route 466. 'Don't worry, that guy's  gotta see us.' The year, 1955; the  day, September thirtieth; the time:  now. It's strange -- I thought all this  would be far more popular. The first star of our show is 'Little  Bastard', James Dean's racing Porsche.  He named it after himself, and had  his racing number, 130, painted on  it. Who is that? The announcer. Do I  know him? Oh, yes. I thought he was a medical  photographer, doing some sort of  accident research. He wanted every  conceivable detail about our crash. The second star is stuntman and former  race driver -- Colin Seagrave, who  will drive our replica of James Dean's  car. I myself shall play the role of James  Dean's racing mechanic, Rolf  W�therich, sent over from the Porsche  factory in Zuffenhausen, Germany.  This mechanic was himself fated to  die in a car crash in Germany twenty- six years later. And the third and  in some ways most important party,  the college student Donald Turnupseed,  played by movie stuntman Brett Trask. Turnupseed was on his way back to  his home in Fresno for the weekend.  James Dean was on his way to an  automobile race in Salinas, a dusty  town in northern California. The two  would only meet for one moment, but  it was a moment that would create a  Hollywood legend. You'll notice that we are not wearing  helmets or safety padding of any  kind, and our cars are not equipped  with roll cages or seat-belts. We  depend solely on the skill of our  drivers for our safety, so that we  can bring you the ultimate in  authenticity. All right, here we go.  The fatal crash of James Dean! Is that part of the act or are they  really hurt? Rolf W�therich was thrown from the  Porsche and spent a year in the  hospital recovering from his injuries.  Donald Turnupseed was found wandering  around in a daze, basically unhurt.  James Dean died of a broken neck and  became immortal. Hold me. I'm dizzy. I can't stand  up. This is an illegal and unauthorized  automotive demonstration which is in  contravention of the Highway Traffic  Act. You are all liable to fines and  possible arrest and confinement...  Disperse at once! Disperse at once! Hit his head, I think. His balance  is off. Why are the police taking this all  so seriously? It's not the police. It's the  Department of Transport. Internal  politics. It's a joke. They have no  idea who we really are. That was glib, wasn't it? 'James  Dean died of a broken neck and became  immortal.' But I couldn't resist. I'd really like to work out the  details of the Jayne Mansfield crash  with you. We could do the decapitation --  her head embedded in the windshield --  and the little dead dog thing as  well. You know, the Chihuahuas in  the back seat. I've got it figured  out. You know I'll be ready, Vaughan. But  I'll want to wear really big tits --  out to here -- so the crowd can see  them get cut up and crushed on the  dashboard. Don't leave yet, Ballard. I want you  to help me. Do you live here? With Seagrave? I live in my car. This is my workshop. And this is the new project, Ballard. What kind of help can I possibly be  to you? You seem to be everywhere at  once as it is. What exactly is your project, Vaughan?  A book of crashes? A medical study?  A sensational documentary? Global  traffic? It's something we're all intimately  involved in: the reshaping of the  human body by modern technology. Vaughan, what the hell are you doing?  Are you trying to create your own  Famous Crash? It excited her, Ballard. Your wife,  Catherine. She enjoyed it. Ask her. It does. He's very pale. Covered with scars. No. But when he's in that car... I think it's badly scarred too. From  a motorcycle accident. Please finish your story. And you had sex with all of these  men in cars? Only in cars? And did you fantasize that Vaughan  was photographing all these sex acts?  As though they were traffic accidents? Get all the paper you can, Ballard.  Some of the stuff they're giving  away is terrific: 'Mechanisms of  Occupant Ejection', 'Tolerances of  the Human Face in Crash Impacts'... I've always wanted to drive a crashed  car. You could get your wish at any moment. No, I mean a crash with a history.  Camus's Facel Vega, or Nathaniel  West's station wagon, Grace Kelly's  Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to  get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't  touch anything else. Is that why you drive this car? I  take it that you see Kennedy's  assassination as a special kind of  car crash? The case could be made. Take a look at this and tell me what  you think. It's very... satisfying. I'm not  sure I understand why. It's the future, Ballard, and you're  already part of it. For the first  time, a benevolent psychopathology  beckons towards us. For example, the  car crash is a fertilizing rather  than a destructive event -- a  liberation of sexual energy that  mediates the sexuality of those who  have died with an intensity impossible  in any other form. To fully understand  that, and to live that... that is my  project. What about the reshaping of the human  body by modern technology? I thought  that was your project. A crude sci-fi concept that floats  on the surface and doesn't threaten  anybody. I use it to test the  resilience of my potential partners  in psychopathology. You drive. Let's get rid of that. I don't want  you blowing it up my urethra. Hard to say. No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan. Vaughan isn't interested in  pedestrians. At home. I couldn't face all this  traffic. It's Seagrave. He was worried that  we would never do Jayne Mansfield's  crash, now that the police were  cracking down. So he did it himself. The dog -- God, the dog is brilliant,  perfect. I wonder where he got it? Come with me, James. I have to  document it. We must have driven through a pool  of blood. If the police stop you  again, they may impound the car while  they have the blood analyzed. You're right, Ballard. There's an  all-night car-wash in the airport  service area. Is there something here that interests  you? Somebody named Vaughan. Do you want  it? Hello? Ballard. I need to see you, Ballard. I need  to talk to you about the project. Where are you? You're making it too clean. Medical tattoos are supposed to be  clean. This isn't a medical tattoo. This is  a prophetic tattoo. Prophesy is dirty  and ragged. Make it dirty and ragged. Prophetic? Is this personal prophesy  or global prophesy? There's no difference. James -- I  want you to let her give you this  one. Where do you think that one should  go? It should go here. I thought that was you, up there. What? Tell me. One of your suitors? It's Vaughan. He's courting you.  Let's go find him. The traffic... where is everyone?  They've all gone away. Not yet. It's only beginning. Vera! Vera Seagrave! Are you leaving, Vera? Listen, I'm  trying to find Vaughan. I think he'll be waiting for us at  the airport. I'd like to register a claim for the  black 1963 Lincoln, the one that  came in a couple of days ago. Is  there a form I can fill out? There certainly is, but you'll have  to come back between 7:30 and 4:30  to get one. What's your attachment  to that thing? A close friend owned it. Well, it's got to be a total write- off. I don't see what you could  possibly do with it. Catherine. Are you all right? Are  you hurt? Maybe the next one, darling... Maybe  the next one...
