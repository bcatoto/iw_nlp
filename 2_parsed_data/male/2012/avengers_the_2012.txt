How bad is it? NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test phase. What are the energy levels now? How long to get everyone out? Do better. We should tell them to go back to sleep? I need you to make sure that PHASE 2 prototypes are shipped out. Sir, is that really a priority right now? Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone. Yes, sir. (to standing agents) With me. Talk to me, doctor. Is there anything we know for certain? Is that supposed to be funny? How soon until you pull the plug? We've prepared for this, doctor. Harnessing energy from space. That can be harmful. Where's Barton? Agent Barton, report. I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things. Well, I see better from a distance. Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off? Doctor, it's spiking again. No one's come or gone. It's oven is clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end. At this end? Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides. Sir, please put down the spear! You have heart. Please don't. I still need that. This doesn't have to get any messier. Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose. We have no quarrel with your people. An ant has no quarrel with a boot. You planning to step on us? I come with glad tidings, of a world made free. Free from what? Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart... You will know peace. Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing. Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us. Like The Pharaohs of Odin. Well, then... (pointing to the Loki team) Need these vehicles. He didn't tell me. (through the walkie talkie) Hill, do you copy?! Barton is... He's got the Tesseract! Track it down! Director? Director Fury, do you copy? The Tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill? Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that brief case. Roger that. Coulson, get back to base. This is a LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at war. What do we do? Ya? (looks at LUCHKOV) It's for you. Calm down. What's wrong? Is he like them? Should have got paid up front, Banner. Avoiding stress isn't the secret. You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded? And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young? Who are you? Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone. SHIELD. How did they find me? Why? What if I said no? And what if the... other guy says no? I don't always get what I want. Well, those I actively try to avoid. What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it? So Fury isn't after the monster? And he tells you everything? He needs me in a cage? I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha... Just you and me? You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control? Not Asgard. Loki. Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us. PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team. This isn't about The Avengers. I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need. No, it's won by soldiers. This guy is still alive! Trouble sleeping? I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill. Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost. We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently. You here with a mission, sir? I am. Trying to get me back in the world? Trying to save it. Hydra's secret weapon. Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs. Who took it from you? He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know. At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me. Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now? You should have left it in the ocean. You're good on this end. The rest is up to you. Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy. I assume. Light her up. Like Christmas, but with more... me. Pepper, you're killing me. Remember? Enjoy the moment. Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line. I'm not in. I'm actually out. Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting. Close the line Jarvis. I got a date. Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius? What do you mean? All this came from you. Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit. An argument can be made for fifteen. Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you. My private elevator... ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I? I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower. ...Call your mom, can you bunk over? Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten. You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message. Then leave it urgently. Security breach. That's on you. Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent. Which is why he can't stay. I don't like being handed things. Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday. The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify. Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others. Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? You know, I thought we were having a moment. How did you notice? Why is he Phil? This is, uh... This. Tomorrow. Well, what if I didn't? Yeah. Square deal. It's the last date. We're about forty minutes out from base, sir. So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me? Didn't really go his way, did it? Well, I hope I'm the man for the job. The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned? The Chitauri grow restless. Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle. Battle? Against the meager might of Earth? Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim. You question us? You question HIM? He, who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated? I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard! Betrayed! Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil. You don't have the Tesseract yet. I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words. You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain. Ma'am? Trading cards? Dr. Banner. Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming. Word is you can find the cube. Is that the only word on me? Only word I care about. (takes in the sentiment) Must be strange for you, all of this. Well, this is actually kind of familiar. Is this is a submarine? Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container? Good. Let's vanish. Gentlemen. Doctor, thank you for coming. Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying? Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear. Where are you with that? You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to? How many are there? Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please. SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor. Is this the stuff you need? Especially if SHIELD knows you need it. I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton? My next target. Tell me what you need. I'll need a distraction. (grabs his bow) And an eyeball. No, no. It's fine. Captain, you're up. Kneel before me. I said. KNEEL!!! Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel. There are no men like me. Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing. The soldier. A man out of time. I'm not the one who's out of time. Kneel. Not today! Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? Make your move, Reindeer Games. Good move. Mr. Stark. Captain. I don't like it. What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily? I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop. Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates? What? It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle. Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in. Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you. What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning? I'm not overly fond of what follows. Now there's that guy. Think the guy's a friendly? Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Stark, we need a plan of attack! I have a plan. Attack. I don't see how I can. There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that. Where is the Tesseract? I missed you too. Do I look to be in a gaming mood?! Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth. I thought you dead. Did you mourn? We all did. Our father... Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that? I remember a shadow. Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king! So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki. And you're doing a marvelous job with that. The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you idly threat. I mean to rule them. And why should I not? You think yourself above them. Well, yes. Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill. I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it... Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king? I am a king! Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home. I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where. You listen well, brother. I... I'm listening. Do not touch me again! Then don't take my stuff. You have no idea what you're dealing with. Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes? This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice! He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist. Okay. Power at 400% capacity. How about that? Hey! That's enough! (comes down; looks at Thor) Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here. I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes! Then prove it! Put the hammer down. Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer! You want me to put the hammer down? Are we done here? In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass. Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?! Ant. Boot. It's an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me. Built for something a lot stronger than you. Oh, I've heard. The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you? How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control.LOKI Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is. Well, you let me know if Real Power wants a magazine or something. He really grows on you, doesn't he? Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what's his play? He has an army called the Chitauri. They're not of Asgard or any world known. He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract. An army? From outer space? (walks in with Coulson; to No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing. (referring to the Iridium) Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants. Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top sails. That man is playing GALAGA! Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did. (covering his eye, looks Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube. Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading? Does Loki need any particular kind of power source? He's got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier. Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect. Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet. Finally, someone who speaks English. Is that what just happened? It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. Thanks. Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you might join him. Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon. I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. Monkeys? I do not understand. I do! I understood that reference. Shall we play, doctor? Let's play some. The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process. If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops. All I packed was a tooth brush. You know, you should come by STARK TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land. Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem. Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Nothing? Hey! Are you nuts? You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed? Is everything a joke to you? Funny things are. Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny. No offense, doctor. No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things. You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut. And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark. You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables. You think Fury's hiding something? He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. (points to Banner) It's bugging him too, isn't it? (bobbling the words) Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and... Doctor? 'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube. I heard it. (pointing at Tony) Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news. The Stark Tower? That big ugly (Tony gives him a look) ...building in New York? (referring to Tony) (taken by that) (holds out a bag of blueberries) I think Loki's trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them. Following is not really my style. And you're all about style, aren't you? (a nerve hit) Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use? Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? Just find the cube. That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice. The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us. What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit. It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does. And I'll read all about it. Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us. Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare. You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege. But you can control it. Because I learned how. It's different. Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you. So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life?BANNER That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what? I guess we'll find out. You might not like that. You just might. Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man. They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we...we come here battling like BILCHSTEIM. BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those? They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path. When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is? I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him. A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops. What are you asking me to do? I'm asking. What are you prepared to do? Loki is a prisoner. Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here? There's not many people that can sneak up on me. (turns to see NATASHA After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate. What is it you want? Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? DRAKOV'S daughter? S�O PAULO? THE HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer... PATHETIC! I won't touch Barton. Not until I make him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In every way he knows you fear! And when he'll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams, I'll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim! No, you brought the monster. What? What are you doing, Mr. Stark? Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you. You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract. We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile. And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2? PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons. Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow. (trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're... I'm sorry, Nick. What were you lying? I was wrong, director. The world hasn't changed a bit. Did you know about this? I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed. And you've been doing what exactly? Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction. Because of him. (pointing at Thor) Me? I thought humans were more evolved than this. Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up? Did you always give your champions such mistrust? (to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one Arms to ammunition, over. You speak of control, yet you court chaos. It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're... we're a time-bomb. You need to step away. (puts his arm around Steve) Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam? (pushes Tony off) You know damn well why! Back off! (comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me. Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you? Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.STEVE The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you. I think I would just cut the wire. Always a way out... You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero. (that did it) A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle! Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds. You people are so petty... and tiny. Yeah, this is a tee... Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr.Banner back to his... Where? You rented my room. The cell was just in case... In case you needed to kill me, but you can't! I know! I tried! I got low. I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out! So I moved on. I focused on helping other people. I was good, until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk! You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm? Doctor Banner... put down the scepter. Got it. Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my little party trick after all. Located the Tesseract? I can get there faster. Look, all of us... The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it. You're not going alone! You gonna stop me? Put on the suit, let's find out. I'm not afraid to hit an old man. Put on the suit. Oh, my God! Put on the suit! Yep! Hill?! (points to monitor) Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but it's impossible to get out there and make repairs while we're in the air. Stark! You copy that?! Coulson! Initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory! Move out! Get that engine down! Detention! Get him through the dark! Come with me. Find engine three. I'll meet you there. Your life? Bring the carrier inwards and head south. Take us to the water. Why water? Navigations recalibrated after the engine failure. Is the sun coming up?! Yes, sir. Then put it on the left! Get us over water! One more turbine goes down and we drop. Stark, I'm here! Good. See what we got. I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris. I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position. What's it look like in there? It seems to run on some form of electricity. Well, you're not wrong. We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to think! Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push. Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded! Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag... Speak English! See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word. We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay. Get his attention. Target acquired. Target engaged. (pulls the trigger; fires guns at HULK) They are not getting through here, so what the hell... It's Barton. He took out our systems. He's headed for the detention level. Does anybody copy? Yeah. Noticed. Are you ever not going to fall for that? (smiles; walks over to the The humans think us immortal. Should we test that? Nooo! Natasha... Am I? Your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky...where is my disadvantage? I don't think I... Cap, I need the lever! Lever. Now! Just stay awake. EYES ON ME! Not an option. These were in Phil Coulson's jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them. We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming. Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes. Well, it's an old fashioned notion. You fell out of the sky. Did I hurt anybody? There's nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though. Lucky. Or just good aim. You were awake when you fell. You saw? The whole thing, right through the ceiling. Big and green and buck ass nude. Here... I didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella. Thank you. Are you an alien? What? From outer space, an alien? No. Well then, son, you've got a condition. You know that? Is that what you know? I got...I gotta go in though. I gotta flush him out. I don't understand. Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and send something else in? Do you know what it's like to be unmade? (Natasha unfastens the But you don't. You're a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you? Was he married? No. There was a uh...cellist, I think. I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man. He was an idiot. Why? For believing? For taking on Loki alone. He was doing his job. He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have... (turns around sharply) (looking at the blood stained Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard. Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered... Sonofabitch! Time to go. I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets? I can. You got a suit? Yeah. Then suit up. Son... just don't. Agent Hill? They needed the push. (holding Coulson's cards) They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything. Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The device is already self-sustained. Shut it down, Dr. Selvig. Okay. The barrier is pure energy. It's unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready to be deployed. Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock. Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity. Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you. You should have left your armor on for that. Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? Stalling me won't change anything. No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one. The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear? Yes, I've met them. Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them. That was the plan. Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you. I have an army. We have a HULK. I thought the beast had wandered off. You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it. (slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you? It should work. Well, performance issues. You know? Jarvis. Anytime now. You will all fall before me. And there's one other person you pissed off! His name was Phil. Right. Army. Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it! You can't. There is no stopping it. There is only the war! So be it. What, did you stop for drive-thru? Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out for you. Sir, we have more incoming. Fine. Let's keep them occupied. Yeah. See them. Stark, are you seeing this? I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet? Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot. Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule? (tries to look away) It's too late. It's too late to stopit. No. We can. Together. Sentiment. Those people need assistance down there. We got this. It's good. Go! You think you can hold them off? Captain. (pulls a trigger on his bow; a narrow is mechanically Just like BUDAPEST all over again! You and I remember Budapest verydifferently. We need to get out! They gotta bring the National Guard! National Guard? Does the army know what's happening here? Do we? I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire. You take them through the basement or through the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th. Why the hell should I take orders from you? I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th. We got his attention. What the hell is step two?! What's the story upstairs? The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable. How do we do this? As a team. I have unfinished business with Loki. Yeah, get in line. Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us... So, this all seems horrible. I've seen worse. Sorry. No. We could use a little worse. Stark? We got him. Just like you said. Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you. I... I don't see how that's a party... Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good time for you to get angry. That's my secret, Captain. I'm always angry. Send the rest. Guys. Call it, Cap. Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we're gonna use containment. Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or your turn it to ash. Wanna give me a lift? Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS. Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck that portal. Slow them down. You've got the lightning. Light the bastards up. (Thor flies up; to Natasha) You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH. Stark. You got a lot of strings sticking to your tail. Just try and keep them off the streets. Well, they can't bank worth a damn. Find a tight corner. I will roger that. Nice call. What else you got? And he didn't invite me? Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal. Our biggest guns couldn't touch it. Well, maybe it's not about guns. (gestures the flying You wanna get up there, you're gonna need a ride. I got a ride. I could use a lift though. Are you sure about this? Yeah. It's gonna be fun. Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON, they caught a lot of civilians there. I'm on it. Everyone! Clear out! I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision, I've elected to ignore it. That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. Until I'm certain my team can't hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population. I send that bird out, we already have. Oh. You. Nat, what are you doing? I've got him. Doctor. It's not your fault. You didn't know what you were doing. Loki's scepter. And I'm looking right at it. Sir, we will lose power before you cut through that shell. JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of Jonah? I wouldn't consider him a role model. 7 ALPHA 11, confirmed. Prepare to takeoff. Stark, you hearing me? We have a missile headed straight for the city. Three minutes, at best. Stay low and wipe out the missile. Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters! I just did. Destination is in 2 minutes, 30 seconds mark. You ready for another bout? What? You gettin' sleepy? I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I can shut the portal down! Do it! Stark, these things are still coming! I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute. And I know just where to put it. Save the rest for return, J. Sir. Shall I call Miss Potts? You might as well. Come on, Stark... (to BLACK WIDOW) Close it. Son of a gun! He's not slowing down. What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me? We won. Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it. (looking up at Stark Tower) We're not finished yet. And then shawarma after. If it's all the same to you. I'll have that drink. These so called heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to the city. This was their fight. Where are they now? I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a leave of absence. The Tesseract is where it belongs: out of our reach. I didn't make it. I just didn't argue with the god that did. Oh, I think he will be. They surely are. And the whole world knows it. Every world knows it. A promise. They'll come back. I am. Because we'll need them to.
