Good girl . . . good girl, Pava. Agafia Mishaylovna says dinner's like to spoil. . . . her father's colour. Worth coming home for, Konstantin Dmitrich! I stayed too long in Moscow. . . . She's a beauty. That's twelve cows sired by Berkut! What should I do with this? In your hat. Your Excellency. Sergei Alexeyich is doing very well, Your Excellency. Telegram. Should I send up the barber? Don't worry, sir, things will shape them- selves, you'll see. Some man came without an appointment, Your Excellency . . . waiting outside. I'm very anxious to see you. I need your advice. Hard at what exactly? Oh--paperwork. Forgive me, but I find that incomprehen- sible . . . As though I'd leave this restaurant and steal a roll from a baker's shop. But I'm talking about love, and you're talk- ing about . . . your appetite. Who? No. Why? Who is he? Potage aux choux a la Russe, as the gentle- man ordered. It's what I wanted. Understand that for me, tonight is a ques- tion of life and death. Dolly said that? I've always thought your Dolly's a gem. I'll come back. I'm too early. Princess Ekaterina! Delighted, delighted! Kitty . . . you look . . . you look-- I don't know. It depends on you. What I mean to say--I came with only one purpose--I want to--will you be my wife? I'm sorry--sorry--wrong moment--but will you? Yes. It was impossible. Yes. How do you know? Count Vronsky? Yes. Princess Kitty . . . It's been so long, and yet it seems like yesterday. It's Kostya. God, look at him! You look like a capitalist! What do you want? Nothing. I came to see you. Good evening, miss . . . madame . . . Don't talk to her like that. It frightens her. You sound like a magistrate. (shouts at her) More vodka for my brother, quick about it. I don't want anything. I'm all right. Who told you where to find me? A colonel in the Third Department. They're watching you. Good. They must think I'm dangerous. What have you got to smile about? Nothing. That's right. The day is coming. I gave up my birthright for it. You're on the wrong side of history. Not because privilege is immoral but because it's irrational. Let go or I'll beat your lights out. I took Mary Nikolova from a brothel but I consider her my wife. If her presence offends you you're free to leave. Are you married? No. Why not? Are you waiting to fall in love? No. Good. Romantic love will be the last illu- sion of the old order. You should marry one of your peasants. Yes. I damn well should! (toasts, casually) The brotherhood of man. Nikolai, you have to see a doctor. Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe till you get your health back. With my wife? If you . . . or go abroad to a spa. I'll send you more if that's what you . . . What about the brotherhood of brothers? Hello, what's this? Austrian royalty on their honeymoon. I've got them for four days. Bad luck. What do they like? Art? Food. Here's the train. Second carriage, Your Excellency. I'll see to the Countess's luggage and bring it on to the house. Yes, of course. Oblonsky's sister . . . Karenina. . . . You stayed longer in St. Petersburg. I can't think what you're referring to, Maman. Excuse me for not recognizing you before. That must have been very boring for you. Keep your people inside until this has been cleared up. Wait for me, Maman. . . . no, Your Excellency . . . He's just gone up. . . . The Princess retired early . . . Is there a message? No. Will you go to confession? God will forgive you. God forgive us then, for committing the act of love. "Not according to my deserts, O Lord, but according to thy mercy"--that's a fine prayer. But I'm full of doubt. Sometimes I even doubt that God exists. I don't know. One day science will tell us. Well, I won't go to confession. What would you like? Kitty! May I have a waltz? You're my first conquest. . . . this vile, idiotic matchmaking of yours . . . Levin is a thousand times better than this Petersburg fop. If he had royal blood my daughter wouldn't need him! No. You look . . . as lovely as ever, Princess Kitty. . . . we were shut up in the train for an hour! Dance with me. I dare say, but if I'm not to dance with you, I'm getting out of this operetta and going home. Bologoye! Fifteen minutes. Can I be of service to you? You know why. I have to be where you are. I can't not. I'll never forget a single thing about you, not a word, not a gesture-- Take the luggage home. Did you have a good night? I'll announce myself. Forgive me, Princess, but I must . . . Am I the only one who knows what's wrong with her? Possibly, Princess, possibly! At your service, Your Excellencies. Where is the patient? Come, come, Princess, we are not backward people--I handle naked bodies every day. Deep breath now . . . By God. I'll challenge the scoundrel! It's the modern way . . . Her symptoms . . . loss of appetite, fast Well, whose pulse wouldn't be fast if some brute of a-- Nervous palpitations. We must treat the nerves. A tubercular cavity is suspected, too soon to tell. Soden water every two hours. I must see her again tomorrow. Prince! Princess! Don't you fret, my little Kate! You'll wake up one fine morning and say to yourself--"I feel well and happy and I'll go out for a walk with Papa!" Here's the thing, Vronsky. A posting has come up and there's a promotion in it for you. Thank you, sir. The garrison in Tashkent. Tashkent? But . . . I would like to stay in Peter, sir, if you don't mind. I don't mind. But your mother . . . I had to see my Commanding Officer. I'm afraid I am becoming ridiculous. I'm Anna's friend . . . but this making-up- one's-mind-to-it in public is not polite to a distinguished man like Karenin. I'm losing hope. And how is Tuskevich? No--you're right. She won't come. I'm going home. Turn round! Wasn't Nilsson glorious? One sees that she has studied Kaulbach, of course . . . There's something Louis Quinze about Tuskevich . . . as if he came with the furniture . . . Ices are being served. Courage! When? Where? And who was responsible for that? Were you glad to see me or not? What do you want me to do? No, that's not what you want. Moscow? I can do better than that. Tonight I refused a posting to Tashkent. I can change my mind, and you'll never see me again. I have no peace to give. There can be no peace for us--only misery or the greatest happiness. You are my whole life now. Do you want me to go to Tashkent? So I'll go to Tashkent. Anna . . . Anna . . . how can I not remem- ber? You're my happiness. I thought that had been done. I gave the order. What can you do with these people? Of Babylon? No. All right, go on, then. Have you stopped stealing bread rolls? So, nothing new to tell me. How is--how are the Shcherbatskys? I . . . Is she engaged now? Oh yes, as if I had time in the summer! And I've got extra land this year at Kashin for the haymaking. Especially not then. I humiliated myself once. Her heart told her no. Did you come to shoot snipe or criticize me? For you, getting married is . . . a social engage- ment. Not for me. For me, it's the condition of personal happiness and living the right way. I'll never again be carried away by passion. I renounce it. I'll have to find another way . . . You should care. You're not supposed to. Everybody. Doctors. Anyway, someone might be watching. I'm not. I'm blessed. Yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. This much. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Alyosha . . . a message from Maman. Her friend Princess Sorokina has a house here, and a virgin daughter, that's not part of the Gentlemen--I give you--the regiment! I heard you turned down a promotion. That was Maman interfering. Yes. And now she's come up with a princess for you. Alexei--we're brothers, so don't take offence. Getting married puts the pack on your back--it leaves your hands free for climbing the ladder. Getting serious about a married woman is like carrying your pack in your arms. So they talk about me. I'm leaving, Sasha. An assignation? Come on, I'll introduce you. Beautiful. A man would come to no harm. Do you think you'll win tomorrow? Makhotin's Gladiator is favourite, sixteen hands--Frou-Frou looks dainty beside him, but she's got heart. Haven't you, my darling? Anna. I couldn't bear not to see you before the race. What were you thinking about? Tell me. Ah . . . My love. Well, love was never a game to us. Here's an end to living in corners, existing day to day on lies. Yes, now we can be together. Tell Karenin everything. Leave him. Yes. Run away. What, then? I'll never forgive myself for your unhappiness. Her back's broken! What's happened? No, you cannot. Their Excellencies Minister Karenin and Madame Karenin! Not in front of the Princess. Konstantin Dmitrich, you'll know your rows when the field's all done! How many mowers is it, Theodore? Forty-two, master. In your father's time it was work for two days for thirty men . . . . . . though he never picked up a scythe himself. It's true I was looking at him. At his wife too, I dare say. They look happier than I've ever been. Is it living simply that I'm looking for? He's some kind of prince at home. Exhaust- ing. Where is Tuskevitch this evening? Captain Makhotin . . . I must leave you. I'm on duty tonight. I am expected. It's punishment enough that I'm on escort duty, without . . . You wrote that you were ill. Stop. There, it was only a bad dream. That's all nonsense! Your note said your husband would be out. But it was awkward . . . a matter of your honour. You made an agreement. Your demon again! Anna . . . I need your advice . . . Am I late? Who is here? Come into the fold . . . Since you saw me, but I saw you not so long ago. You were driving to Ergoshovo . . . I was at Kashin for the haymaking. I'm so glad to see you. You're just the same. Months and months ago! No. I haven't. It was a matter of honour, defending a woman's honour . . . I would. But not for my neighbour's wife. An impure love is not love, to me. To admire another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but sensual desire indulged for its own sake is greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of something sacred which is given to us so that we may choose the one person with whom to fulfill our humanness. Otherwise we might as well be cattle. Since we last met, there is something I have often wanted to ask you. This. I know what it says. Then. But now? Can You. Can you Forgive. And Forget. I never stopped . . . She's dying. Please let me stay. Thank God! She talks only of you. More ice. Whatever you think of me, please believe me, I love her--I could not have done other- wise than what I . . . what I did. I would like you to go, Maman. In Petersburg? (he taps his breastbone) I'm finished here. . . . no, I'll go to her and tell her it's not too late to stop this business! Better now than when we're married and she realises she doesn't love me! How can she? I mean, look at me! Suppose she's only marrying me to get married? Suppose she's still in love with Vronsky? She's making a terrible mistake! I'll go to her and tell her she's free, that's what I must do . . . Your coat, sir. I have to talk to Kitty. You can't love me. Think it over! Let people say what they like! Yes. If you don't love me. Do you? Well, I love you! Princess Elisabeth Federovna Tverskaya, Your Excellency. You look like a boy. But so pale. We'll go south . . . to the sea air and sunshine . . . This is Agafia, and Vasili, the steward . . . My wife, Ekaterina Alexandrovna Levin. And that was Kuzma. Come inside! Careful--door's still a bit . . . (to Levin's look) it's all right, it'll be dry tomorrow . . . Is it all right? Sit down a minute. A moment. It's me, Konstantin. Yes, good. The doctor here is useless--get me a doctor from Moscow. Where did you go? I asked for you every- where, when I was getting married. Yes. My wife . . . You can't stay now. Yes--yes . . . She's going. Did the doctor see her? I will nurse him with Agafia . . . The woman will find somewhere in the village. You won't see her. She knows it's impossible for you to meet her. It is a torment to me that I have brought you under the same roof I'm going . . . Thank you, Father . . . and how much . . . ? At your benevolence. It is a custom, not a levy, Your Excellency . . . Jesus overturned the money-tables outside the temple, but . . . It's your fault for letting her in!--you should be sacked. I've had enough of this--it's my job to get the boy out of bed before His Excellency comes . . . Why are you in the dark? Yashvin is going to call . . . you remember him. (about her clothes) Are you going out? What's the matter? But I told you yesterday . . . My brother . . . What's happened? Well . . . Alexander agreed to everything. Mother's house in Moscow will go to him, and the country estate will be our new home . . . as soon as the divorce . . . Karenin hasn't answered your letter yet? It's wonderful to have you both returned. But perhaps you'll meet at the opera tonight? Madame, your box is number four! You'll find me there with Princess Myagkaya. Will you come, Vronsky? You know you can't go to the theatre? For heaven's sake-- Anna--I implore you--don't you know . . . ? It's because I love you and care about you. That would make it worse. You'll come up to see us afterwards . . . ? Talk to Varya. Will you call on Anna? For God's sake, Anna isn't a criminal! Of course. Please . . . I would be honoured if you would take mine . . . Catullus, printed in Venice, 1501 . . . remarkable. A thousand apologies, Princess, but . . . Captain Makhotin . . . As far as I'm concerned, she's my wife. We're going to Moscow, and then to my place in the country. But for a day or two, Anna will be at home, at my flat. Then, I'll say goodbye now. Either one. Yes, it was my fault. I know how to make you sleep. Good! I'm bored here. When should we go? I didn't say you bore me. Moscow bores me. When should we go? . . . Tomorrow? Anna . . . Anna . . . Stop. I put off our departure for a day or two, and you tell me I don't love you. I'll telegraph Maman. We'll go on Sunday. I'll do anything you want. I don't want to. I love you. You can't ask why about love. So--will you be all packed? I'll be out today making the arrangements. No. I'll be with my lawyers. I'm waiting for some documents. Then I'm having dinner to say goodbye to old comrades. My God, this is unendurable. I can invite them here if you like. I didn't show it to you, because Stiva keeps telegraphing what we already know. Kare- nin promises nothing, but will consider . . . I hide nothing from you. Until we're married, our daughter is legally Karenin's. I care about it because we need to be free to marry. But we aren't talking about-- Is there anything you wish to say to me? She brought papers from Maman. Anna? Count Vronsky had already left, Your Excel- lency. He took a cab to the station . . . to the Countess. No, Your Excellency, both princesses are at the house of Countess Vronsky. I'm waiting I'll be buying in feed before winter's over. Well, you don't press people hard, but you live rightly, for your soul, not your belly. My soul! What's that? I know what my belly is. How do we know what's rightly? I believe in reason. Reason? And was it reason that made you chose a wife? No. You're a great one for reasoning, Konstantin Dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your mathematic--that's what's rightly about it! Where's Ekaterina Alexandrovna? I came looking for you . . . I understood something . . . He smiled at me.
