This is the island of New Penzance. Sixteen miles long. Forested with old- growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by shallow tidal creeks. An important seabird habitat. There are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from Stone Cove. The year is 1965. We are on the far edge of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the ferocious and well-documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of September -- in three day's time. Morning, sir. I don't know. I think I skipped a stitch. Safety-test, sir. Come again? The vehicle appears to be in good working order. I'm just checking if -- Reckless cycling. Second warning. Next time, I take away the keys. Watch my line, Edgar. Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Over. Morning, Randy. What can I do for you? Over. What does that mean? Over. 9. Any idea why? Over. I guess we better notify his folks. Over. Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp. There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll find him. We're just notifying you as a matter of protocol and so on. I'm confused by that statement. You can't invite him back? Am I speaking to Sam's father? Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. We're notifying you as a matter of protocol. You say you can't invite him back? You say he's an orphan? Well, I don't understand how that works. What am I supposed to do with him? What's your real job, sir? I'm a math teacher. What grade? Eighth. Why? What if he resists? Who? Shakusky. Are we allowed to use force on him? No, you're not. This is a non-violent rescue effort. Your instructions are to find him, not to hurt him. Under any circumstances. Do I make myself understood? I heard he ran away because his family died. I heard he never had any family in the first place. That's probably why he's crazy. I'll tell you one thing: if we find him, I'm not going to be the one who forgot to bring a weapon. Most likely not. I disagree, Counsellor. It'd take him three days, at least. Be that as it may, will you let me know if you see anything unusual? What kind of bird are you? No, I said, "What kind of bird are you?" I'll be leaving soon. What happened to your hand? Really. How'd that happen? Sam. What's yours? Were you followed? Good. Did you bring a cat? Can you read a map? I do cartography. I feel we should go halfway today and halfway tomorrow, since you're a less experienced hiker, and you're wearing Sunday-school shoes. (pointing on the map) Here's where we are right now. I'd like to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred (which means four o'clock). How does that sound? You want some beef jerky? Let's go. Are you thirsty? Well, if your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it. You can quench your thirst with the spit, supposedly. Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It cools your head down. True, but this adds camouflage. Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air, and you can see which direction the wind's blowing. Unknown. I guess it doesn't really matter, as long as we cover our tracks. These might be poisonous. Not bad. Anyway, they're good for survival. I agree. Why do you say that? You smell like perfume. I brought water, too. Should we catch him? Trout bait. We need worms. You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe I've got a licorice whip. How strong of a swimmer are you? OK. Well, I'm not that strong of a swimmer, so I wear a life-preserver. I think it's a good policy to get in the habit, anyway. Watch out for turtles. They'll bite you, if you put your fingers in their mouths. Let me see if I can catch this one. Somebody wrote on him. You got one! Fish on hook! Reel him in! Slowly. You're doing good. This is for fishing. I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained for. Anyway, I used to be. We can feed your cat the guts and eyeballs. What else did you bring? We should make an inventory. Go ahead. That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't you get the packing list I sent you in my last letter? That's OK. We can share. These are all library books. In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time. Some of these are going to be overdue. Do you steal? Why? You're not poor. Are you depressed? How come? Does that mean you? To me, it is. I'm sorry. I'm on your side. Which one's the best? I don't know, but she borrowed my record player for ten days without asking. What does that mean? That's a loaded question. Good evening. Sorry to startle you. I was I know, that's what I'm saying. The search party's not over yet. In other OK. Where'd she -- I don't know, but just for the record: ninety-five percent of all runaways return home within six hours. That doesn't do you any good right now. It's just a statistic -- but in all likelihood Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at her best friend's house playing Chinese Checkers at this very moment, as we speak. How's Laura? How's Laura? Mrs. Bishop, I mean. Is she upset? I got to get this spot-light fixed. Sam Shakusky. That's my escaped Khaki Scout. His family died. What does he say? I think he's onto us. Of course, he is. Of course, he is? Why aren't we worried about that, then? Well, I didn't know. Or, anyway, I thought I was wrong. Did you hit him? All right. We know they're together. We know they're within a certain radius of this spot. I'm declaring the case with the county right now. Until help arrives: I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one, and the kid with the curly hair to come with me in the station wagon. Randy, you drop-in and head up-river with the rest of your troop, then split-up on foot. Becky, call Jed and tell him to circle over this end of the island and fly low. (angry at himself) Rats! I should've put more pine needles on it. Let's go. We're almost there. What do you creeps want? We're looking for you. Why? Because you're a fugitive. No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts. You're still in uniform. Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. You don't have that authority. We've been deputized. Now are you going to come along peacefully or not? Listen to some reason: I don't like you. You don't like me. Why don't you stupid idiots just let us disappear? It's tempting, but I can't allow it. You shouldn't be friends with him. Because he's crazy. We know him a lot better than you. He's emotionally disturbed because his family died. Nickleby, tie him up. Do not cross this stick. You're doomed, Shakusky. It was him or us. They got Snoopy through the neck. No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue. Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to make it. They're after us. We got to move. It's too late! He's already gone! I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're panicking. The first rule in any emergency is you never -- Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to die. She stabbed Redford in the back with lefty scissors! Puncture wound. Lower lumbar. Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit! Where's Snoopy? Clear the dock, Edgar! No, she's in the woods with Shakusky. Where'm I going? The infirmary at Fort Lebanon. We'll be right behind you. Warm up the motor. I'll be right back. Walt, it's very clear: the two of them conspired in this together. Stop. I do blame him -- (pointing to Scout Master Ward) -- but I also blame myself and both of you. With all due respect: you can't let your children stab people. What are you talking about? Well, I am! Easy does it. Calm down, Laura. As some of you know, I taught Sam for the cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a smart boy, and he expressed a keen interest in the history of the island's indigenous peoples. In particular, I recall his fascination with the idea of retracing the original path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration. What I'm getting at is this: I think I know where they're going. I know! On three! Me, neither. Let's change it. What should it be? I made you some jewelry. Are your ears pierced? Do you mind? Tilt your head sideways. Why do you always use binoculars? That sounds like poetry. Poems don't always have to rhyme, you know. They're just supposed to be creative. What do you want to be? When you grow up. Go on adventures, too. Not get stuck, too. I guess that sounds almost like I'm just repeating what you just said, but I couldn't think of anything as good as it. On the other hand, maybe we'll get blown up by an atom bomb. You can't predict the exact future. It's possible I may wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean. I wish I didn't have to mention it, but just in case. I don't want to make you be offended. Some people frown on these problems. It's not an accomplishment. I inherited it from my mother. It's actually not meant for a male to wear -- but I don't give a damn. I don't think so. We're getting to know each other better. I feel like I'm in a family now. Not like yours, but similar to one. I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about. I don't know. You said ten days or less. Didn't you ever think about what would happen next? Not to my recollection. You're a traitor to our family. Give him his mail. They can't invite me back. I gave them too much aggravation. Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social Services. I'm calling in reference to Sam Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand he's in your custody. That's correct. What's his condition? Has he suffered any injury or trauma of any kind? He's OK. Very good. How do I get to you? The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can bring you in with the mail. I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's acceptable to you. Is someone able to 60. Uh-huh. Is that a yes? Uh-huh. Very good. I'll contact you again before the end of the day. Wait a second. Yes? Social Services? Captain Sharp. What's going to happen to him? Well, normally, we'd try to place him in another foster home, but that option is no longer available to us, in my opinion, with his case history -- which means he'll go to Juvenile Refuge. Who's speaking? Right. An orphanage -- but the first step is the admissions panel requires a psychological evaluation to determine whether or not the boy's a candidate for institutional treatment or electroshock therapy. Beyond that -- Excuse me. Shock therapy? Why would that be necessary? He's not violent. The report describes an assault with scissors. That was the girl! Who did that. Well, maybe she needs help, too -- but that's not our job. OK? OK. -- and why is it still happening? We women are more emotional. You have to I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway -- but something also happened which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other. Something happened to us. I agree with you. That's eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying -- but I don't have to, because you're twelve years old. Look, let's face it, you're probably a much more intelligent person than I am. In fact, I guarantee it -- but even smart kids sometimes stick their fingers in electrical sockets, if you see what I mean. It takes time to figure things out. It's been proven by history: all mankind makes mistakes. It's our job to try to protect you from the dangerous ones. If we can. You want a slug? What's the rush? You've got your whole life in front of yourself. Ahead of you, I mean. Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor. What does that have to do with it? So are you. That's true. Did you love someone ever? Yes, I did. What happened? She didn't love me back. Ah. I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's what people say. Thanks. What happened? A drunk truck driver smashed into them. Good grief. I heard he's going to reform school. I heard they're going to take out a piece of his brain and send him to an insane asylum. I like his girl. That's not true. He just felt her up. Over-shirt or under-shirt? What do you need? In other words, it's over. Until further notice. I understand. Except me. Well, I hope you can. I think you will. You're doing the right thing. No, you won't. I admire them, you know? There's a purity to it. I only feel bad because they both seem like such unhappy, lonely, miserable people -- but maybe that's romantic. I don't see it that way. Get out of my chimney. No, thanks. It's worthless to me. There's no point. Not without Suzy. How'd you get here? Diversion tactics. Good thinking. Did you leave another note for Lionel? That's true. This is the island of St. Jack Wood, extending far north from Land's End along the deep-water channel that leads to Broken Rock. A low flood-plain separates the beach from the town-ship above. A small but prosperous community. The barometer reads twenty-seven inches and dropping. Strong winds, as you can see, already at twenty-two knots. (checks his watch) The time is now four thirty-five A.M. Did the judge consider your application for leniency? Rogers vs. Yentob. Half of those were self-inflicted. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Why? Well, I'll be damned. Who is this bimbo? Who's your unit leader? I don't care how they do it where you come from. You want pop? You want candy? You want a snake-bite kit? Get some money. Come back in five minutes. Is this him? Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, resigned. He's hot. Almost too hot. What's in the can? Give it to me. You badge in seamanship? Yes, sir. Good. There's cold-water crabber moored off Broken Rock. The skipper owes me an I.O.U. We'll see if he can take you on as a claw cracker. It won't be an easy life, but it's better than shock therapy. Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the chapel tent? Back there, but the padre's home with the mumps. Why do you ask? I want to bring my wife. You his girl? Technically, I'm a civil-law scrivener. I'm authorized to declare births, deaths, and marriages. You're kind of young. You got a license? I can't offer you a legally binding union. It won't hold up in the state, the county, or, frankly, any courtroom in the world due to your age, lack of a license, and failure to get parental consent -- but the ritual does carry a very important moral weight within yourselves. You can't enter into this lightly. Do you love each other? Are you sure you're ready for this? Let me rephrase it. Spit out the gum, sister. In fact, everybody. I don't like the snappy attitude. This is the most important decision you've made in your lives. Now go over by that trampoline and talk it through before you give me another quick answer. I guess we better try to pretend we're struggling over our decision for a minute before we go back over there and tell him -- What? Why? How? I don't know what to say. I guess they're probably just trying to pretend they're struggling over their decision, but at least -- OK. Let's do a blood test. -- which we hereby consecrate on this day, the fifth of September, 1965. That's the end of the short-form. Do any of the witnesses have objections or remarks? Usually, they don't. Skotak. That's my fee. Nobody knows. Let's take a vote. That's my fee. You're just like your brothers. OK, give them the tennis ball can. Sign here -- and initial here and here. Take the carbon. Leave the Bible. Let's go. He's going to work on a shrimper, if I understand correctly. Me, too. Me, too. I think they're coming back. Be quick, sailor! She left her binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent. Just leave them. We can't. It's her magic power! You killed your dog, by the way. Snoopy? Well, it couldn't be helped. Why do you consider me your enemy? Because your girlfriend stabbed me in the back with lefty scissors. She's my wife now. Congratulations. I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago. From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm trying to understand. Why don't you like me? Why should I? Nobody else does. He's here! The fugitive! Stop him! I'm OK. Follow me! Captain Sharp, we've located the missing troop. They just fled camp. We're in 85. Stand by, Commander Pierce. Jed, re-route to St. Jack Wood. Tell Social Services the boy's been spotted at Fort Lebanon. Becky, notify the Bishops: Suzy's there. Randy? You monitoring? Tower control, this is Jed. Confirm co- ordinates for new destination: alpha-two- two-seven-one-fiver. Looking pretty soupy up here. Wouldn't mind setting down before the pot boils over. (to Social Services) Hang on, Social Services. 87. You find them? No, sir. (to the entourage) Prepare to mobilize to higher ground. St. Jack Church is the designated storm shelter. (to Secretary McIntire) Notify all scouts to muster outside my tent on the double. Attention, company! Prepare for -- Who's that? You call yourself a Khaki Scout? I'm sorry, sir? Where's your goddamn troop? They could get killed out there! You don't have them? You're a liability to us. I'm field-stripping you of your command. Attention, company! Prepare for emergency evacuation! I'll be right back. Affirmative, sir! Who's in charge here? Randy! What happened? Where's the boy? We don't know yet. That's not acceptable. (pretending to be irritated) What do you want me to say, lady? (to no one in particular) Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee. You're Captain Sharp? That's right. I'm Social Services. I remanded the boy to your personal custody. You're responsible for his safety. I'm told he was just struck by lightning. That's the first I heard of it. It's true. Scout Master Ward, I presume? Your reputation precedes you. You two are the most appallingly incompetent custodial guardians Social Services has ever had the misfortune to -- in a twenty-seven year career! What do you have to say for yourselves? You can't do this. They'll eat him alive in there. Where? (aside, to Scout Master Ward) What's the name of the place again? Juvenile refuge? Juvenile refuge. That sounds like jail. Just find the boy -- and deliver him -- (motioning to herself) -- to Social Services. Nothing else is in your power. I'm sorry. Suzy's still out there. Who are you? The parents of the stabber? I want the details. Where's the scout she knifed? Field Mate Redford, sir. (through the oxygen mask) What's his condition? Let's go! Nobody's going anywhere. He's not getting shock therapy. That's it! I'm citing you for gross misconduct! You are hereby summoned to appear before the board of -- I'm writing you up back! Be notified that you stand accused of the mistreatment and What are you talking about? I won't let you do it! Look! They're gone. Who? Suzy? Sam? Gadge! Lazy-eye! Skotak! They're here? Where'd they go? Answer me! Halt! Stop! Stay there! Where you going? What are you doing? Come down! Social Services? Do you read me? Over! How deep is it? I didn't bring my life jacket. OK. Counsellors? What's the legal perspective? Over! I concur. Open with article fifteen of the Codes of Civic Jurisdiction. No party, under any circumstance, shall be denied due and proper consideration... Wait. Just in case this is a suicide, or 100. they capture us, and we never see each other again anymore -- thank you for marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you, Suzy. Let's jump. Goddammit! Tell him! Over! Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky? What do you think, pal? We're coming down! Over and out. Don't let go. The Black Beacon storm was considered by the U.S. Department of Inclement Weather to be the region's most destructive 102. meteorological event of the second half of the twentieth century. It lingered through six high-tides and inundated the islands with punishing winds and extreme high waters. On St. Jack Wood, powerful surges broke the arcade boardwalk and demolished the village bandstand and casino. The coastal areas of New Penzance were battered and changed forever. But harvest yields the following autumn far exceeded any previously recorded, and the quality of the crops was said to be extraordinary. See you tomorrow.
