(to the townsfolk) Hello. Hello. Good evening, ma'am. Ma'am? Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me where I am? Hello! Hello! Yes! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 4. Ah, finally! Arghbal... Ach! How many times have I told you to knock? Warga blarghgha! What...? The Globe? Shoo with your pointy heads. Why are you always under boot? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 5. What is this? Have you checked the axis? Is rotation balanced? Wardle bawddrel. Can it be? (then calls off) Dingle! Make preparations! We are going to have company. Des Moines, we've got a cuspid at 23 Maple. Head out! Sandy, thank you for coming. I know, I know, but I obviously wouldn't have called you all here unless it was serious. The Boogie Man was here - at the Pole. Yes! There was black sand covering the globe. And then a shadow! Well, ah, not exactly... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 10. Look, he is up to something very bad. I feel it, in my belly. Please. Bunny. Easter is not Christmas. Why are rabbits always so nervous. (turning his attention) Tooth! Can't you see we're trying to argue. Aah! Man in Moon! Sandy, why didn't you say something? (to Man in Moon) It's been a long time old friend! What is big news? (back up to the moon) Manny...what must we do? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 13. He's choosing a new Guardian. Must be big deal! Manny thinks we need help! Jack Frost. Guardian. (tongue stuck to frozen Ah, now that, that was fun. Hey wind... Take me home! Woooooohoooooooooo! SNOOOOOWWWW DAAAAYYYYYY!!! Whoa, whoa. Huh, that looks interesting. Good book? You're welcome! (goes running after them) Hey guys, wait up! Are you guys coming to the egg hunt Sunday? Yeah, free candy! I hope we can find the eggs with all this snow! Stop! No, you stop! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 17. Whoa, it says here that they found Big Foot hair samples and DNA, in Michigan. That's like, super close! Here we go again. You saw the video too Claude, he's out there! That's what you said about aliens. And the Easter Bunny. (grabs his sled) Wow, the Easter Bunny is real! Oh he's real alright. Real annoying, real grumpy, and really full of himself. Come on, you guys believe anything. Mom! Sophie fell again! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 18. Are we sledding or what? Who's Jack Frost? (smile drops - offended) Hey. Who's Jack Frost? Okay, who threw that? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 19. Well, wasn't bigfoot kiddo. Ow! You struck first! Oh! Free for all! Alright, who needs ammo? Look at that. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 20. She hit Cupcake. You hit Cupcake? Oh! Did you throw that? No. Hey, come on. Stop! You can't catch me. Ooh, little slippery! Whooaaooah!!! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 21. Whoaaa. Jamie, watch out! Stop! Aha, whoa! Jamie! Turn, turn! That's the street! What are you doing? Stop! There's traffic! Whoa! Whoa, don't worry kid, I gotcha. Hold on. It's gonna be alright. Ahhhh. No, no, no, no... Keep up with me kid! Take a left. Whoa, no, no, no, no... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 22. Yeah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... There you go! No! No! Whoa. AAAAHHHHHHHH! Yeah! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 23. Wow, that looks serious! Jamie! Jamie, are you alright? Is he okay? Whoaaa! Did you guys see that? It was amazing! I slid - I did a jump and I slid under a carï¿½-ERF!! Whoops. Ooooh! Cool! A Tooth! Dude, that means cash! Tooth Fairy cash! I love the Tooth Fairy! (his fun cut short) Oh, no... That's totally awesome. You lucky bug! Lucky! No! I gotta put this under my pillow! I wish I lost my tooth. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 24. Ah, wait a minute! Come on, hold on, hold on! What about all that fun we just had? That wasn't the Tooth Fairy, that was me! I lost two teeth in one day once - remember that?! What are you gonna spend your money on? What are you gonna buy? How much do you think she's going to leave? Let's go...I'm cooold! My ears are freezing. I can't feel my toes. Ah, it's hot cocoa time. What's a guy gotta do to get a little attention around here! -- and then BAM! The sofa hit me, and, and see? (opens mouth, tries to say `my tooth came out!) Ah hoo hay ow! Yeah. I'm ready. But I can do it this time! You wanna help me, Soph? We can hide and see the Tooth Fairy! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 26. Mom... If there's something I'm doing wrong, can you, can you just tell me what it is? Because I've tried everything, and no one ever sees me. You put me here, the least you can do is tell me, tell me why. Right on time, Sandman. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 27. Ohhhh, I thought I heard the clippity-clop of a unicorn. What an adorable dream! (leans down to Cupcake) And look. At. Her. Precious child. So sweet, so full of hope and wonder. Why, there's only one thing missing...a touch of fear. Hahaha! That never gets old! Feel your fear. Come on. Come on, that's right. Yesss. What a pretty little Nightmare. Now, I want you to go tell the others the wait is over. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 28. Don't look at me like that, old friend. You must have known this day would come. My Nightmares are finally ready. Are your Guardians? Whoa! Did you leave the windows open again? The garage door is wide open. Bunny? You're not still mad about that...are yah? Hey! Durbha wahla. Put me down! What the... Durtal bardla burdlew. Dwbard urghwetee. Bwardla arghl. Ahhhhhhhhh! Quiet. Hey, there he is! Jack Frost! Wow, you gotta be kidding me. Hey, hey. Whoa, put me down. I hope the yetis treated you well? Oh, yeah. I love being shoved in a sack and tossed through a magic portal. Oh, good! That was my idea! You know Bunny, obviously. Obviously. And the Tooth Fairy? My, my what? And Sandman. (sees Sandy is snoozing) Sandy! Sandy! Wake up! Hey! Ho! Anyone wanna tell me why I'm here? That's not really helping. But thanks, little man. I musta done something really bad to get you four together. Am I on the naughty list? On naughty list? You hold record! But no matter. We overlook. Now we are wiping clean the slate. How come? How come? I tell you how come! Because now...you are Guardian! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 33. What are you doing! Get, get that offa me! This is the best part! Huh? What makes you think I want to be a Guardian? Of course you do! (to the elves) Music! No music! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 34. Look, this is all very flattering, but ah...you don't want me. You're all hard work and deadlines, and I'm snowballs and fun times. I'm not a Guardian. A child who believes. And good or bad, naughty or nice, we protect them. Tooth...fingers out of mouth. Okay, no more wishy-washy! Pitch is out there doing who knows what! You mean the Boogeyman? Yes! When Pitch threatens us, he threatens them as well. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 35. All the more reason to pick someone more qualified! Pick? You think we pick? No, you were chosen like we were all chosen. By Man in Moon. (stares, dumbstruck) What? The Man in the Moon, he talks to you? You see, you can not say no. It is destiny. But why, why wouldn't he tell me that himself? After 300 years this is his answer? To spend eternity like you guys cooped up in some, some hideout thinking of, of new ways to bribe kids? No no, that's not for me. No offense. Uhh, you ever hear of a snow day? I know it's no hard-boiled egg, but kids like what I do. No, the kangaroo's right. Oh. And this whole time I thought you were. If you're not a kangaroo, what are you? Jack. Walk with me. It's nothing personal, North. What you all do, it's just, it's not my thing. Man in Moon says it is your thing. We will see! Slow down, wouldja? I've been trying to bust in here for years, I want a good look. (peeved - still rushing) What do you mean, "bust in?" Oh, don't worry, I never got past the yetis. Rwwarrrrrr. Oh, hey Phil. Keep up, Jack! Keep up! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 38. Whoa! I always thought the elves made the toys. We just let them believe that. Very nice! Keep up good work! I don't like it. Paint it red. Step it up, everybody. Fruit cake? Ah, no, thanks. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 39. Now we get down to tacks of brass! Tacks of brass? Who are you, Jack Frost? What is your center? My center? If Man in Moon chose you to be a Guardian, you must have something very special inside. Hmmmm? Here. This is how you see me, no? Very big, intimidating. But if you get to know me a little-- (hands the doll to Jack) Well, go on. You are downright jolly. Ah, but not just jolly... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 40. I am also mysterious. (twist - smaller doll) And fearless. (twist - smaller doll) And caring. And at my center... There's a tiny wooden baby? Look closer. What do you see? You have big eyes? Yes! Big eyes. Very big. Because they are full! Of wonder! That is my center. It is what I was born with. Eyes that have always seen the wonder in everything! Eyes that see lights in the trees, and magic in the air! This wonder is what I put into the world, and what I protect in children. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 41. It is what makes me a Guardian. It is my center. What is yours? I don't know. North, North! I told you, I'm not going with you guys! There is no way I'm climbing into some rickety old... ...sleigh. Whoa! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 42. Hey! Moi deti, moi deti. Quiet, quiet. Okay, one ride, but that's it. Everyone loves the sleigh. Bunny, what are you waiting for? Ah, get in. (hoists Bunnymund up) Buckle up! That was just expression! Are we ready? Good! Let's go! Clear! (cracks the reigns) Hyah! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 43. Out of the way! Hyah! I hope you like the loopty loops! Here we go! WOOO-HOOOOOO!!!!!! Klasno! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 44. Whoa! Hey, Bunny-- Check out this view-- Awww...you do care. Hold on everyone, I know a shortcut. I say, Tooth Palace. Hyah! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 45. What!? What are they!? They're taking the tooth fairies! Hey little Baby Tooth, you okay? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 46. Here, take over! Hyah! Yah! Jack, look out! Aaaahhhh! Tooth! Are you alright? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 47. The Big Four, all in one place. I'm a little star-struck. Did you like my show on the globe, North? Got you all together, didn't I? You'll stick a quarter under my pillow? Why are you doing this? Maybe I want what you have. To be believed in. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 48. Maybe I'm tired of hiding under beds. Ah, go suck an egg, rabbit! Since when are you all so chummy? We're not. Oh good. A neutral party. Then I'm going to ignore you. But, you must be used to that by now. Whoa! Hey, easy, girl. Easy. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 49. Look familiar, Sandman? Took me a while to perfect this little trick. Turning dreams into Nightmares. Don't be nervous, it only riles them up more. They smell fear you know. Oh, the Dark Ages. Everyone frightened. Miserable. Such happy times for me. Oh, the power I wielded! Well that's all about to change. Oh look, it's happening already. What is? What's going on? Didn't they tell you, Jack? It's great being a Guardian -- but there's a catch. If enough kids stop believing, everything your friends protect - wonder, hopes and dreams - it all goes away. And little by little, so do they. No Christmas, or Easter, or little fairies that come in the night. There will be nothing. But fear and darkness and me! It's your turn not to be believed in! He's gone. I'm sorry, about the fairies. Why would Pitch take the teeth? What do you mean? My memories? But, I wasn't anyone before I was Jack Frost. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 53. What? You should've seen Bunny. That night at the pond...I just, why I assumed...Are you saying, are you saying I had a life before that? With a home? And a family? All these years, and the answers were right here. If I find my memories, then I'll know why I'm here. You have to show me. Then we have to get them back! No! No! No such thing as too late! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Idea!! HAHH!! We will collect the teeth! We get teeth! Children keep believing in you! Give me break! You know how many toys I deliver in one night? And Jack, if you help us, we will get you your memories. I'm in. Quickly! Quickly! Hop to it rabbit, I'm five teeth ahead! Is that a challenge, cottontail? A race? Is it a race?? This is going to be... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 56. EPIC!! Ah, you okay? How long is a long time? Hmm... Yipa!! Is piece of pie! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 58. That's my tooth! Sandy! Sandy! Yes! No! The lights...why aren't they going out? They're collecting the teeth? Oh pipe down, or I'll stuff a pillow with you! Fine, have your last hurrah. For tomorrow, all you pathetic scrambling will be for nothing. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 62. Kids, huh? It's a little different up close, huh? Yeah, well, look let's just get you taken care of. Then it's Pitch's turn, huh? Here you are! Oh, what gives slowpokes!? How you feeling, Toothy? Haha! That's what I want to hear. SSSHHHHHHHHH!!! You think I need help to beat a bunny? Check it out, Peter Cottontail. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 64. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! This is about Tooth. It's not a competition! But if it was -- (reveals even larger sack) I win. YEEEEEHAAAHH! Oh no... Santa Claus? The Easter Bunny?...Sandman...The Tooth Fairy! I knew you'd come! He can see us? Huh? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 65. No, stop that's the Easter Bunny. What are you doing, Abbey? Down! But that's a um, that's a greyhound. Do you know what greyhounds do to rabbits? Stop! Sit! Down girl, down! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 66. Sandy, Sandy! Ah! Candy canes... Whoaaaaaaaaaa! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 67. Whoops... Oh, I really wish I had a camera right now. Sandy, c'mon! We can find Pitch. Whuh-huh...? Wahooo! Haha! Yes! Waaahahoooo! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 69. HAAAH! I got it! Sandy! Sandy, did you see that?!? Look at this thing! Frost? You know, for a "neutral party" you spend an awful lot of time with those weirdos. This isn't your fight, Jack. You made it my fight when you stole those teeth. Teeth? Why do you care about the teeth? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 70. Now this is who I'm looking for-- Whoa--?? Remind me not to get on your bad side. (looks up, pleading) Okay, easy! You can't blame me for trying, Sandy. You don't know what it's like to be weak and hated. It was stupid of me to mess with your dreams. So I'll tell you what- You can have `em back! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 71. You take the ones on the left, I'll take the ones on the right? Boo! Ah! Ha. Ha. Ha. Come on! Aaaaaaaah! We gotta help Sandy! Hyah! Noooo! Jack! Hahahahaha!...Don't fight the fear, little man. Hurry, hurry! I'd say sweet dreams, but there aren't any left. Sandy... No...NOOOOOO!!!! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 75. Ahhhhhh!!!!! AAAHH!!!! Jack! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 76. I, I didn't know I could. Finally! Someone who knows how to have a little FUN! Are you alright? I just, I wish I could've done something. Done something? Jack, you stood up to Pitch. You saved us. But Sandy wo-- (putting his hand on Would be proud of what you did. I don't know who you were in your past life, but in this life you are Guardian. But how can I know who I am, until I find out who I was? You will. I feel it, in my belly. It's fear. He's tipped the balance. Bunny is right. As much as it pains me to say old friend, this time Easter is more important than Christmas! We must hurry to the Warren. Everyone, to the sleigh! Shostakovich! "Buckle up." Is very funny. Sophie? Ah, snow globe. Don't look at me, I'm invisible, remember? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 80. Blood and gums? When was the last time you guys actually hung out with kids? We are very busy bringing joy to children! We don't have time... ...for children. If one little kid can ruin Easter, then...we're in worse shape than I thought. Rimsky Korsakov! That's a lot of eggs. Uh, how much time do we have? Single file! Okay, that's little strange. Not bad. Look, I'm sorry about that whole, you know, the "kangaroo" thing. How about I take her home? --no match for this. (twirls his staff) Trust me, I'll be quick as a bunny. We should get back. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 86. Jack... That voice, I know that voice... Don't worry, there's still time. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 87. (waving Baby Tooth off) Baby Tooth, Baby...come on! I have to find out what that is. Shhhh! keep it down. (leaps to another cage) I'm gonna get you out of here, just as soon as I -- (under his breath) As I can -- Afraid? I'm not afraid of you! Maybe not. But you are afraid of something. You think so, huh? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 89. I know so. It's the one thing I always know. People's greatest fears. Yours is that no one will ever believe in you. Well fear not, for the answer to that... Is right here. Do you want them, Jack? Your memories? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 90. ...in this little box. Why did you end up like this? Unseen. Unable to reach out to anyone. You want the answers so badly. You want to grab them, and fly off with them. But you're afraid of what the Guardians will think. You're afraid of disappointing them. Well let me ease your mind about one thing. They'll never accept you. Not really. (trying to scramble away) Stop it! Stop it! After all, you're not one of them. You don't know what I am! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 91. Of course I do. You're Jack Frost. You make a mess wherever you go. Why, you're doing it right now. What did you do? More to the point Jack, what did you do? Baby Tooth! No. There are no eggs. There's none anywhere. I give up. Come on, let's go. I don't understand. I checked everywhere! There's nothing! There's no such thing. I know. Now come on. I don't understand. Why wouldn't he come? Let's get out of here. Easter Bunny, where are you? This is the worst Easter ever. The Nightmares attacked the tunnels. They smashed every egg, crushed every basket. Nothing made it to the surface. I was...it's... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 94. That is why you weren't here? You were with Pitch? No, listen, listen...I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. He has to go. What? Whoaaa, whoa, whoa...aaaah! Let's check the park again. Really? For what, the Easter Bunny? Guys, I told you - I saw him! He's way bigger than I thought, and he's got these cool boomerang-things- Grow up, Jamie. Ah man, seriously. What's happened to you guys? It was a dream. You should be happy you still get dreams like that and not... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 96. He really is real! I know he is. They never really believed in you. I was just trying to show you that. But I understand. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 97. You don't understand anything! No? I don't know what it's like to be cast out? All those years in the shadows I thought, no one else knows what this feels like. But now I see I was wrong. We don't have to be alone, Jack. I believe in you. And I know children will too. In me? Yes! Look at what we can do! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 98. What goes together better than cold and dark? We can make them believe. We'll give them a world where everything, everything is... Pitch black... And Jack Frost too. They'll believe in both of us. No, they'll fear both of us. And that's not what I want. Now for the last time, leave me alone. Very well. You want to be left alone? Done. But first... Baby Tooth! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 99. The staff, Jack. You have a bad habit of interfering. Now hand it over. And I'll let her go. (re: Baby Tooth) Alright, now let her go. No. You said you wanted to be alone. So be alone! No! Baby Tooth! You alright? Sorry, all I can do is keep you cold. Pitch was right - I make a mess of everything. Hey? We will. (calm, serious) It's okay. It's okay. Don't look down, just look at me. I know, I know...but you're gonna be alright. You're not gonna fall in. We're gonna have a little fun instead. Would I trick you? Well, alright. Well, not, not this time. I promise. I promise, you're gonna be...you're gonna be fine. You have to believe in me. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 103. (casual, playfully) You wanna play a game? We're going to play Hopscotch! Like we play every day! It's as easy as...one...whoaaaa... Two... (the next jump) Three! Alright... Now it's your turn. One... That's it, that's it...two... Three. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 104. Whoa... Did you -- did you see that? It -- it was me! I had a family! I had a sister! I saved her! (whispers up to Manny) That's why you chose me. I'm, I'm a Guardian. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 105. We have to get out of here. Come on Baby Tooth! I owe you one. Come on, let's go. What's wrong?! None of you can fly? The lights... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 106. You're all free to go! We won't be needing any Christmas toys this year, thank you! Nor ever again! They're all going out... Only six left! Six precious children who still believe in the Guardians with all their h-- (a lights blinks out) Make that, five. Oo! Four! Three! TWO! One. Jamie! Okay look, you and I are obviously at what they call a crossroads, so here's what's gonna happen - If it wasn't a dream and if you are real, then you have to prove it. Like right now. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 108. (desperation creeping in) I've believed in you for a long time, okay? Like my whole life in fact. So you kinda owe me now. You don't have to do much, just a little sign so I know. Anything. Anything at all. I knew it. (seeing the window) Huh? He's real. Whoa... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 109. Whoa! Snow? Jack Frost? (a stunned beat) Did he just say--? Jack Frost. He said it again. He said -- You said... Jack Frost. That's right! But-but that's me! Jack Frost! That's my name! You said my name! Wait, can you hear me? Can you... Can you see me? He sees me. He sees me! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 110. You just made it snow. I know! In my room. I know! You're real? Yeah! Who do you think brings you all the blizzards and snow days, and you remember when you went flying on that sled the other day?! That was you? That was me! Cool! Right?! But what about the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy I mean-- Real-real-real! Every one of us is real! I knew it! Um...Jack Frost. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 111. Ah, moi deti! Come back! Is official. My powers are kaput. You okay? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 112. What are you doing here? Same as you. The last light! (to North and Tooth) Wow! It is you! I mean it is you! I knew it wasn't a dream. Jack! He sees you! Wait, but, where's Bunny? Losing Easter took its toll on all of us. Bunny most of all. Oh...no... That's the Easter Bunny? What happened to him? He used to be huge and cool! And now he's cute. No! Actually he told me you were real. Just when I started to think that maybe you weren't. (to the others) Get Jamie out of here. Be careful, Jack! Jack Frost! Let's end this, shall we? That little trick doesn't work on me anymore. Jack! That was good try, Jack! A for effort! (groaning in pain) He's stronger. I can't beat him. Very well. There are other ways to snuff out a light. (laughing, genuinely) Look how fluffy you are! Would you like a scratch behind the ears? I can't tell you how happy it makes me to see you all like this. You look awful. Jack, I'm scared. We're gonnna have a little fun, instead. That's it. That's my center. So what do you think, Jamie? Do you believe in the Boogiema... Now let's go get your friends. Yeah! Come on! Whoa! Cool! Jack Frost! Come on, we need your help! Huh?! Cupcake? Yeah! The Easter Bunny's real! And Santa! Whoa, yeaaaaaaaah!!! (sees Pitch, makes U-Turn) Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! You think a few children can help you? Against this! They're just bad dreams, Jamie. Aww, you'll protect them. But who will protect you? I will. I'll try. Still think there's no such thing as the boogeyman? I do believe in you. I'm just not afraid of you. Whoa...whoaaaa! Whoa, yeah! No! Get them! Do your jobs! Whoa! Aaaaaahhhhhh! Thanks, Tooth! Hyah! Wrong roof. Look at that! (gets an idea) I got it. (off their confused looks) Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 125. I know what we have to do! Guys, come on! It's over Pitch! There's no place to hide. Man, this is so cool! Yeah, alright! Wahoo! Wow! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 126. Welcome back, old friend! Sandy. Yeah! Yeah! Oh yeah? Bring it on! Your center? It took awhile, but I figured it out. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 128. You're all on naughty list. Bunny, think fast! No. You dare have fun in my presence! I am the Boogeyman! AND YOU WILL Noooo! (under his breathe) No. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 129. Leaving the party so soon? A quarter? You can't get rid of me! Not forever! There will always be fear! So what? As long as one child believes, we will be here to fight fear! Really? Then what are they doing here? They can't be my Nightmares, I'm not afraid. Looks like it's your fear they smell. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 130. Ahhh, no....AAAAAHHHHHH!! No, no, nooooooo! Are you ready now, Jack? To make it official. Then is time you take Oath. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 131. "Will you, Jack Frost...vow to watch over the children of the world? To guard them with your life - their hopes, their wishes, and their dreams? For they are all that we have, all that we are and all that we will ever be." I will. Then congratulations, Jack Frost - for you are now and forevermore...a Guardian. Oh man! Woo! Yeah, Jack! Yeah, Jack! Yeah! Wooo! Yippa! Alright! Yeah! Go, Jack! Alright! Woo. Alright! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 132. Klasno! Alright Jack. Yeah! Awesome! Jack! You did it Jack! Wooo!

Ohh...can you believe this? Whoa, did you guys see that? That's awesome! Wow! Whoa! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 133. Wow! Look at that! So totally insane! Time to go. Whoa! It's beautiful. Wow, that was awesome! You're leaving? But, what if Pitch comes back? What if we stop believing again? If I can't see you -- Hey, hey, slow down, slow down. You telling me you stop believing in the moon when the sun comes up? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 134. (considers, then) No. Okay, well do you stop believing in the sun when clouds block it out? No. We'll always be there, Jamie. And now...we'll always be here. (points to Jamie's heart) Which kind of makes you a Guardian too. I can't keep my eyes open. I think I gotta go home. Let's go home. What time is it? I'm sleepy. Jack! Hyah! Woooo! Yeah! Yay! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 135.
