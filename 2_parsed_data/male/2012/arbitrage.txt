They lived through the Depression, Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they didn't think bad things might happen; they knew they would happen. When I was a kid my favorite teacher was Mr. James. Mr. James said that world events always revolve around five things: (extending his fingers one- M-O-N-E-Y. This was fifth-grade econ. (smiles, off her laugh) But this is something we've seen over and over again, time and time again, that competition for this-- limited amount of dollars out there, can make even the best of us manic. So it's not surprising that we see these asset bubbles, but when reality sets in of course, they burst. (handing him the coffee) Here you go... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 3. You're disappointed. Quants? Derivatives structures? What was that about? It makes no sense. That's what you said last week. Why'd we go down there? To sign. And did we sign? No. No. We did not. Instead I fly two thousand miles for a marketing meeting... And where was Mayfield? What was this "emergency"? What was that about? (after a beat) Did you speak to the auditors? Why? What if... we don't don't close this week... Hi, guys! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 5. It's my job! It's my job. You guys turned out fine! (to Peter, as they hug and (hugging her, happy) No, no that's okay. Where's my drink, is this mine, here? HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY! Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, I didn't even know it was my birthday! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 6. What did Mark Twain say about? He said-- old age... is clearly a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter. I've done a lot of things in my life, worked very hard, but being here, looking around-- at all these shining, radiant faces, I know that my best work is right here in this room, right now... I'm deeply proud of all of you. That's the best gift your mother and I could have hoped for, so, thank you... ...and to have sold the company to Standard this morning! That, too, Peter, but- no business tonight-- no business! Although your one-track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too! Now, I'm aware that may seem uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me sixty years to realize what's truly important -- and it's you guys so thank you all very much. (as they applaud) Hear, hear! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 7. Kids are wild. No, no no, you should have-- I want more "you's" around. Yeah, yeah yeah... What? Yeah, well... I just... wanted it to be about the family tonight. (shakes his head) Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel about that. Trash can. (sits back, takes a drink) Well, you gonna keep skirting around it? My darling, you are still in your 20's. I am 60. That's a big difference in point of view. It catches up alright. And maybe there's some other things I'd like to do. Maybe I would like to spend a little more time with you guys... outside the office. What? Office. Yeah I gotta finish up that thing. I'll be back as soon as I can. (into his phone) Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh... When you get this -- I want you to call Chris Vogler at Fremaut, tell him I need to see him right away, okay? Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm always late-- you know that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm always saying I'm sorry about being late. (crosses to her) It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather be here with you. The show's gonna be beautiful. (slight beat, then Oh wow, that's great. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 11. You made this? This is amazing. One candle, thank you very... Thank you, Diane. So? I'm here. Guess what's not? Jeffrey, I told you, I'm... "...working on it," yeah. Well, while you're doing that, lemme tell you what's not working... Jeffrey... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 12. ...what's not working is my four hundred twelve million dollars that's sitting in your account so you can pass your audit, the four hundred twelve million that you needed, you said, for two weeks, and which has been languishing now for (looks down at paper) thirty-two days, while it could be elsewhere invested, earning an actual return, instead of couching the absurd lie that you're spinning. What do you want me to say? That you're gonna get a signature from Mayfield, and that my hostage money and my fee are going to be sent to me promptly, say... by tomorrow? I am solving the problem. I am getting you your money and your fee. You will have them very shortly. When? As soon as they sign the contract. You know, I'm not the one with the liability, pal. I just made a loan. You're looking at jail for a thousand years for fraudulent conveyance and... ...Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that!... I didn't get you into this mess! You were a friend of mine!... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 13. ...remember when you asked me if it was a good idea to divert half your liquid assets into a fucking copper mine? What did I tell you? (stands, heading to door Are we done here? I think we're done here. Friday morning I take my money back. You can't do that... ...the fuck I can't, it's in an escrow bill with one-day call rights... ...I need the money there until they sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again? That's really not my problem, is it? (stares, fumes) Not your fuckin problem... Let's go. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 14. The DOW continues its uptick this morning on new housing starts to rise 132 points. Asian markets fared less well, especially in Russia, where further nationalization plans caused foreign investment to sputter, leading to various... What? (calming a little) Good. Very good. Is this too blue? Ay, yay yay. I look old. They haven't signed the papers. (rubbing his eyes) So did I, but for some reason they're stalling. I didn't get any sleep on the plane and... What plan is that? You sound like a fortune cookie. Then you married an idiot. There hasn't been time. I don't wanna be in the cemetery! I'm taking care of it. I've had to move some things around for the merger. (walks up to her, laughs) Only two million? You remember-- Riccio's? Full meals... two bucks... all you can eat... three bucks... (as he heads out, smiling) I don't know what you're talking about... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 17. (sotto, to Gavin) Where the hell is Mayfield? (as they sit) Mr. Miller, thank you for coming. We were just getting acquainted with Brooke and Peter here. I hope they didn't beat you up too much. Dad, we've been talking about operations. Tim thinks once we consolidate we can save about fifty percent on our back-office. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 18. I'd love to hear about that, but... I had thought Mr. Mayfield planned to join us tonight. I was just telling Brooke: now that we can market your quants' track records, we have access to a host of new capital that... ...assuming we shed debt through some small liquidations, I'd say... I'm sorry, gentlemen, we've been here nearly two hours now. Where is Mr. Mayfield? Detained where? Alright, I think I can leave you with my family? Of course. Again, Mr. Miller, a privilege. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 19. Yeah, yeah yeah. This is the bullshit way you try to close a deal? No. What's up? What is it? What kind of entries? Alright, come by about eleven tomorrow and we'll look at it then. And Brooke? See if you can find out what happened to Mayfield. How're they doing? Great. Everyone loves them. Yeah, but how are they doing? So-so. He scans the party further. No Julie. Where's Julie? She's in the back. Hey, Julie. Oh, really? Painter? Yeah, that's great. (as he notices Julie leave, to the group) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 22. I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk to you about them in a second. What? Why are you doing this? I will take those two. And the Rubik's cube on the back wall. (pointing to list) Right there, number seven. Don't tell her it was me. (off her nod) I mean it. You got it. ...fucking Dalwood wouldn't know a Van Gogh from a Van Eyck. And they call it a "State of Contemporism..." I'm in your bedroom. Can you get those people out of here? Look down the hall. Do you see me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 24. Okay, so I'm serious. I thought we should talk... ...I was working, do you understand? I'm under enormous pressure, I have obligations... I was there! I was there! I was late, but I was there. And I'm here now. I'm sorry. Because I liked them. Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why would you fail? You know, I'm not the kinda guy who wants to throw money away but if you wanna start a business, you have to project a certain image. Success. The market's a disaster right now; nobody's moving anything. That's why you gotta show sales. People look at you then and they say "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and that's what they remember. Always. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 26. Come away with me. Let's just take your car and go... There's a place upstate. Very beautiful, on the water. We can wake up there together- just you and me. I'd like that. Yes, I wanna make it collect... Your name, sir? Lawrence Grant. Jimmy, it's me. I want you to listen to me very closely... You gotta be fucking kidding me. Catching detective wants us to rule before he calls it. We've been having the same fuckin' argument for twenty years. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 29. They can't handle one drunk motorist kills herself? I'm not so sure about this... Car roll had multiple impacts, but she was here and her feet were down there. ... So who kicked out the door? Let's go. You gonna tell me what this is? It's better you don't ask. So all you're sayin' is, you need a ride somewhere. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 30. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 31. What'd you say? I told her I had to run out a minute. Do you trust her? Is this the kinda shit you used to do to my dad? Do you trust her? Yes, I fucking trust her! Good. So you're at home, and I'm at home. My wife gets up at five am for Pilates -- I will be there next to her, where I've been all night. And you'll do the same with yours. This is some pretty fucked up shit. Jimmy... No, man, come on, I don't hear from you since the fuckin' funeral, you call me up out of the blue, using my father's name, ask me... ...what do you want, you want money? I will give you five thousand dollars! I will give you ten thousand dollars! I'll give you whatever you fuckin'... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 32. You wanna talk to me like that you can get the fuck outta my car and you can walk! You want that?! You wanna fuckin' walk home?! (after a beat) Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not myself. I need your help. You alright? Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital. No, I just... have to get home... I'll deal with it in a couple of hours. What if you don't make it a couple of hours? Then I don't make it. (through the window) Call me, alright, and let me know it's okay. (as he exits) Better we don't talk for a while. (can't believe it-- through the window) So what you get in a bind and just call up the only nigger you know? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 33. I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just go home. Yeah, alright, man. Take care of that. Everything okay, sir? I'm fine, Glen. Go back to bed. What? I just went to... eat some ice cream. (pained, shifting his body) Yes... Ellen... Do you still love me? Hypothetically, the situation you're describing would be involuntary manslaughter. And such a person... ...would be in a lot of trouble, especially if that person was closing a merger with a large public bank where any publicity or arrest could delay or derail the transaction. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 35. But that's only if there was some evidence that could link him to the crime. Fingerprints, DNA? Very hard to collect after an explosion. The real world's different from television. What about cell phone records? Did this person make any calls from the area? Not from a cell phone, no. Then they won't be able to place him there. What would you advise such a person to do? To confess immediately. Failing which? To put as much distance between himself and the event as possible, if possible. But let me tell you something, and I'm speaking to you as a friend now: there are about fifty things that person wouldn't have thought of. And the more time that passes, the more lies that are told, the worse it gets for him. Robert... Yeah. They're going to come to you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 36. I know. An accident's not the worst trouble. If we talk to them now we can probably work it out. You tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close, and I gotta tell my investors about our real losses? Nothing good. And what'd you say about the Justice Department? Depending on what they decide to arrest me on-- fraud conviction gets me twenty years? I did. (laughs in pain) What choice do I really have? You're aware Congress plans to extend the audit requirements for private funds. Of course I am aware. I gave testimony to the committee. You know this. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 37. Well, Standard wants to prepare for it now. So I was asked to go through every one of your trading books and reconfirm their assets. No. Absolutely not. That's impossible. Don't worry. I put the team on different books and I left "Old Hill" for myself. Anyway, I'm here to tell you-- I cleared it. The audit's cleared? The report will be issued today. Actually, I'm calling it my "swan song." You're leaving? Yeah, on Friday, it's a five-year clock. And why? Uhh.. To prevent exactly what we're doing. But honestly, there's nothing left to worry about. It's -- great. Get out. What? What? What the fuck are you talking about? Oh... Oh, it was fine... He's here? Where? He called? Maybe he's settling in. You think we're dealing with a fucking idiot? I spoke to legal. They said Standard will sign once they get the audit report. That's being issued now. Never mind that, just find out why Mayfield hasn't called us. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 39. Do I have to do every Goddamn thing myself? JUST FIND OUT! WILL YOU Reconcile what? Of course I'm listening. Okay, those trades are in the special book. They don't get audited on the same balance sheet. May I help you? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 40. Detective Bryer. I was hoping to see Mr. Miller. Possibly. That's ridiculous. That can't be right. Okay, I'll look into it. I promise you I'll look into it. Yeah. (stiffens, then into phone) Give me two minutes, then send him in... Yes, my other meeting just got here early. We'll have to pick this up later. Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 41. Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You can sit there. We just heard about it. Really terrible. Okay, so you were an investor in her gallery? Correct. How'd you meet her? Through... I think it was a charity function. My wife and I have a foundation. Uh-huh. When'd you last see her? Last night, at the gallery. Did you stay till the doors closed? No, I think I left about ten. Where'd you go? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 42. Home. You go straight home? Yeah. You stay home? Yeah. Your wife home? Yes. Okay. Okay, so now, back to the gallery. Did you see her with anyone? See her with anyone-- what do you mean? You know like a boyfriend, someone she might've left with? Not that I noticed. No. No, no. Reason I ask, is, that we haven't located the driver. The driver? Yeah, someone else was driving. Sometimes, the driver, will go for help-- and he'll die tryin', you know... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 43. (after a beat) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 44. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 45. (nods, stands as Robert Sure. Thanks. What happened to your head? What? That's a nasty cut; I've been looking at that for the last five minutes. Does it hurt you? (touching the cut) Oh, no, I just hit it on the medicine cabinet. Last night? This morning. Hate when that happens. Yeah. Me, too. Well, thanks for the chat. No problem. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 46. (calling after her) Mrs. Miller? (shows his badge) Detective Bryer. Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you. (turning on the charm) Just take a couple a seconds. It's about your husband. How'd it go? Well, the wife blew me off-- which was interesting. And he didn't admit to the affair, but then he wouldn't, would he? Why didn't you pick him up? He's a very rich man. What happened with the pay phones? Got about fifteen calls in a three- mile. Two of `em look a little strange: got an incoming-- that's probably a local drug deal... And the one we care about? Collect call. About a minute and a half. Made from the Chevron station on West Lake Road. Who'd he call? Cellphone in Harlem. Still waiting on the address. (thinks, gets up and and you're a billionaire, right? You're a billionaire-- so whaddya do...? (Mills shrugs for the (out of breath) Robert, I just heard about Julie... I'm so sorry. Her Gallery called. Her mom's flying in today. (managing a nod) Her Mom...? Service here? Tomorrow at nine am. Well we should pick up the expenses for that. Whatever she wants. You'll take care of that personally, for me? Of course... Are you okay? You reach Mayfield? Not yet, but we'll get him... Robert, I... Thanks. Appreciate your concern. Let's flash him. Mr. Grant? Yes? NYPD Homicide, would you mind stepping into the car? What's this about? (through the window) Just get in the car, Jimmy. Am I under arrest? (through the window) You wanna be? So let's do this again. Man, for what? My answers ain't gonna change. You were asleep. Right. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 51. And your phone rings. Right. And it's a wrong number. Why do you accept the charges on a collect call from a wrong number? I don't think I wanna answer any more questions. And you stay on the phone a minute and a half on a wrong number? What the fuck do you talk about, area codes? I want to talk to my lawyer. Listen, kid, we know you went out there. We ID'd your photo with your neighbor who saw you getting into your truck ten minutes after this call was made. Well if you got all that, what the fuck you need me for, officer? I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation here, Jimmy. This is a homicide. Lawyer. You're gonna sign him out? I called in Earl Monroe. The basketball player? Civil rights attorney. You remember Crown Heights? He's the best? He's the best above 96th Street- and that doesn't make him any cheaper. You've gotta get Jimmy out of this. It might not be that easy. If he doesn't cooperate they're likely to indict him on obstruction. What would he be looking at? Hard to say. With his prior... Five years, maybe ten. This is not going to go away. I'll call you tomorrow if there's any news. Don't worry about anything. And don't talk to anyone else. You take care. Come on, get in. All you said was you wanted a fucking ride! You didn't tell me you killed that girl! Jimmy... I'm trying to put my life back together. Okay, I appreciate you helped us, but now you're pushing it too far. It's gonna be okay. Like it was your ass sitting in there? Like you know a fucking thing about how it's gonna be? We've got you the best criminal lawyer-- --Don't you got your own son for this? Why the hell you didn't call him? Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay? Well I'm sorry your son's a fuckin' idiot, but that ain't my fault. This isn't productive. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 54. Oh, okay. So tell us then, Syd, what happens now? We meet with Earl and we go from there. I understand that right now they don't have enough to charge you with anything. Your under suspicion. Under suspicion? Motherfucker, I'm Black! I am aware of that. And what exactly would you like me to do about it? (BUZZING the driver) Gentlemen, my driver will take you where you wanna go, but I cannot be a party to this conversation, so this is where I get out... Why couldn't you have just stayed? I couldn't. Why not? Because I have responsibilities. And if I stayed there, a lot of people would've been hurt. Somebody was hurt. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 55. Other people, Jimmy. I've got business troubles, you understand...? People rely on me. Listen... I want to talk to you a second. Come here. I wanna show you something. Now, you know, your father asked me to look after you. Yeah. Yeah, I know I messed up, alright? I'm sorry. But I do want to help you, you know that. (handing Jimmy the folder) So I've been able to set up a situation for you. What's that? It's a trust. In your name, assets of $2 Million dollars. Take a look at that. Are you serious? You think money's gonna fix this? What else is there? (to the driver) Yo, yo man, pull over. (stares at him) What are you gonna do? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56. I look like a fucking snitch to you? I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know. Are you? Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Just-- read it. Just take it home and read it. It's not gonna hurt you. What? Yeah, put him through... (he hears Chris come on) Chris... What...? Chris... Chris? CHRIS! Goddamnit, Chris! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 57. What are you doing in my office? Hello? Explain what? You don't know what you're saying. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 58. Brooke nods, heads to the door. Ben put his arm on her shoulder to stop her. Brooke... Can't you just leave it alone? She stares at him. He drops his arm. She exits and turns. You can't fire me. Who do you think asked me to make those changes? She stares, then approaches him. He was doing a little dealing a while back, but it looks like he stopped. Nah, they're all dead. Well, he had an excellent lawyer. We pulled his parents' tax returns. Guess where his father worked for twenty years? So far he won't budge. What the fuck...? Tell me what is going on. I can't. Tell me what's going on! I can't! Why not?! It's not me! What do you mean it's not...? THE AUDIT PASSED! (slackening his grip) The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed? It passed! It passed a week ago! Like I said. Everything's fine! We confirmed the money, it's all straight and done. Then... why did you tell me that it didn't? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 61. Because they asked me to hold it. They? Who's they? (thrashes him again) Who is they?! Mayfield. Mayfield? What? They're negotiating. He wants a better price. Sherry Netherland...? Yes, James Mayfield, please... (as he enters his car) Mr. Mayfield... I think it's time we had a talk. The warrant doesn't need to hold. It just needs to scare him into giving up Miller. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 62. This is about Judge Rittenband, isn't it? It's cause he's running again? I'm getting a piece of new evidence that'll seal it a hundred percent. I'll have it before you go in the jury room... Look, Ray. We like this kid. I don't wanna lose him. Think about it: if we flip him, you get Robert Miller. What's that worth to Rittenband, and to you for that matter...? Twenty years, Ray. Twenty fucking years, we watch these guys- they out-lawyer us, they out-buy us. I'm fucking sick of it. Where's the consequence? The guy did it. He does not get to walk just cause he's on CNBC. Yeah... I need a serious fuckin' favor... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 63. Did we have a meeting? Sweetie, you okay? What's wrong? You wanna sit? I did. (beat, then real fast) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 65. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 66. Yes. You don't have to lie. You didn't know about it. What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt? Is that what you wanted? For people to get really hurt? Because it's my job! You are not my partner! You work for me! (off her bewildered stare) That's right. You work for me! Everybody works for me! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 67. Brooke. Brooke. Come here. Please? Please. Just, just come here. Just for a second and sit down. There's something I wanna tell you. And whatever you decide I won't blame you... (she turns to look at him) I'm on my own path. It's up to you to move with it or against it. But I'm the patriarch; that's my role. And I have to play it. I'm sorry. Oh, man, what? Jimmy, take a ride with me. Where? Back to the station? No man, just get in the car. What if I say no? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 68. I'm not threatening you. I'm just asking you -- take a ride with me. Alright, man, what? Look, it's pretty fuckin' simple. I know you went to pick him up. This is what you wanna talk about? I told you I ain't makin' no more statements. And I know why. Somebody cares? Take a look at this. (hands him a case folder) I've got his phone calls, I got his text messages. I've got the relationship with the girl. And they were fucking, by the way. And then I've got you. I've got the time log from the pay phone. I've a got a fucking tollbooth photograph of you driving your car through the Triborough. Where you got that...? That's bullshit, cause I didn't do it. That's impossible. Really? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 69. You lied to me. You lied to the police. You obstructed justice. Talk to Earl, Detective. Fuck Earl! You see this? (holds up the grand jury Look: I know you think Miller's your friend. Who's Miller? I know about your father. (beat, then hard) You don't know a Goddamn thing about my father. I know Miller paid his bills while he was dying. I know he got Syd Felder to get you out of trouble on your gun charge. That doesn't add up to this. You done? Okay, he's driving, he crashes- he runs away- who does he call? Calls you. Why do you think that is? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 70. `Cause you're disposable- you're the one person he could call that just doesn't fuckin' matter. You're a- you're a throwaway. You're just another part of his transaction. (tries to open the locked door) Will you open the door? So what, what? You're his new nigger now? Open-- OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR! You didn't kill that girl. He did. (containing his rage) Will you -- open -- the door? He's using you. I know it - you know it. Do the right thing. Now get outta my fuckin' car. He's gonna walk. You're certain? Courts aren't for certainty, but he says he was at home, why shouldn't he be? A phone call doesn't make him a liar. (off Robert's nod) But what's baffling to me, though, despite your sentimental history together, is why you would put your family's future in this kid's hands. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 71. He's not like us. Is that a good thing? (laughs, plays with his I don't know. How's Ellen? She's good. Fine. (stops packing, looks up) Why? I heard something... Yes...? She met with Gil Deuchman. The estate lawyer? Yeah. Has she mentioned anything? Not to me. Yes. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 72. Yes. It was a wrong number. No. I'm not lying. This is crazy. (whispers in Jimmy's ear) You're gonna have to answer that. April 11th, two thirty-three am. D D G five five four two. Yes. Yes. I can't. No. This is not my car in this picture. I don't know how you all did that, but this is not my car. That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito. Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that? They're lying! Okay, now here's what... I can halt the decision. We need a minute, Detective. What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute? Cause if you do we could... You can get the fuck outta my face. How `bout that?. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 75. So you wanna keep playing games? Or you ready to tell me something? Detective, I need to talk to my client. Now if you would just please... How you- How you all just gonna lie like that? Huh? How you all just gonna lie?! We didn't lie. You lied. That wasn't my car. ...Jimmy, don't say anything else. Sure it wasn't. And it was a telemarketer called you from the pay phone? He stopped at the Chevron to make a late night sale? That picture was some bullshit... ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's going on? Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy. Tell him. See how the boss'll like this one. Last chance. (rising, to Jimmy) Wait here. Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce you to Julie's mom, Sandrine. I am so, so sorry. (shaking his head softly) No... It's just... not fair, is it? This shouldn't have happened. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 77. You keep sending people to my office to "do business." They're just getting acquainted. With the intricacies of my operation so that you can... not buy it? (to a waitress as he sits) Just coffee, please. You remember what it was like on our side of the fence. Everything just moves... a little slower. Plus this whole audit mess doesn't help. You know, clearing that all up... Fuck you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 80. (sotto from the waitress pouring his coffee) (returns to volume) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 81. Your price is too high. You have a nice day, James. Four hundred. Five-fifty. Four-fifty. Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no? And if it's no, send any further communication right to my trash can. (extending his hand) It's a deal. One other thing -- six months and I'm gonna be gone. I'm outta here. My daughter's gonna take it over. You know her, you trust her. Alright. And you're gonna have to make my son a VP. Robert... No, no. He doesn't have to do anything, he just gets the salary, he gets the office. Both of `em on five-year employment contracts, and my lawyers draft them. Yes or no? Yes. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 82. What are you doing? I'm writing the deal. Are you serious? (ripping off the tablecloth) I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it. I'll send over a draft of the press release. Are you all right? I'm fine... Before I go -- how much would you have paid...? Six hundred. And you would've taken...? Four seventy-five. So we made a good deal. (as he heads away) Yeah. Actually, I lied. I would've taken four. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 83. ...Anyway I will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night. But as the sale's official as of this afternoon, you are now free to talk about it. Any questions? Will we get new business cards? Yes, everyone but you. Alright, it's a great day. Your hard work made it happen So how'd you make Mayfield come around? I met his price. I just took it out of your share. Robert? Yeah. Good work. Well, thank you. Now go get me that fucking hospital check. Yeah. Hello. You want something to drink? What you got? Not much. You got any milk? No. I'll take a water. Where are you going? What? The boxes. I was planning on Virginia, but it looks like I'm not going anymore. You waiting for me to say something? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 85. (off his silence) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 86. (as Jimmy sits) (off his silence) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 87. It was an accident. And yeah, I know, all the people counting on you, whatever, but -- you told me Earl was gonna make this right. Now you know I care about you, all the things you did for us, and for my father, but Earl said they're offering me a deal, no charges at all. I walk away. They just want to know who I went to pick up. Why are you putting me in this position, man? Why are you putting me in this situation? Can you just hang tight? Just a little longer? Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's on the table for twenty-four hours. After that, they're filing the case, and Earl says we're gonna lose. (nods, stands) Alright I hear you. I'll be back with you as soon as I can. Just hang with me a little bit. You said take the money. What can he offer me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 88. He says he didn't take the toll. (after a beat) Does Standard have clawback? Let's just say I decide to go in... No, just listen, listen to me. If I were to surrender, now, could they roll back the deal? Four years, you think? Call the DA, get it started. Yeah, Glen. Did Mrs. Miller say where she was going tonight...? Aha... No, I'm sure... I'll try her cell. Syd...? Yeah- Did you make that call to the DA yet...? Thank God. No, no, no. No. Listen to me, call Earl, tell him to get his car, tell him to meet us at my house in twenty minutes... And, Syd...? Bring a notary. Hi I'm Brent Owens, the night supervisor. How can I help you? (handing him some papers) Hello, Brent. I'm Earl Monroe. I'm executing a criminal evidence request. I need to get a look at one of your lane tapes. Brent looks over the papers, confused. I don't understand. This says you want to look at a tape made ten minutes ago...? (holding up his hand) Wait. Wait. Just wait. A RAPPING noise on the window startles Syd, who rolls it down, sees Earl, and opens the door. Earl climbs inside, removing a FOLIO from his breast pocket as he talks. Okay, they won't release tapes without a court order, but they did give me a print out, the same kind they used at Jimmy's indictment. Earl reaches inside the folio and removes the PHOTOGRAPH he got from the toll authority. He lays it on the counter. It's from a toll camera, showing his car and license plate. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 91. The Lexus- that's your car, your plate? You got Jimmy's? Son of a bitch. Your honor... We don't know where it is. It's not in the evidence locker. We don't know. (after a beat) We lost it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93. This case is dismissed with prejudice and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON, Detective. (Bryer stops.) If you have another suspect in the automobile death then you are to present him, but Mr. Grant is free from any further inquiry in this matter. This is over. Do I have your understanding? Thank you. I'm sorry? Oh, okay. (approaches the judge) So let me get this straight: What you're telling me is I'm supposed to sit around with my thumb up my ass and my fingers crossed hoping that one of these fucking days, somewhere down the line, one of these rich assholes is gonna say the wrong thing LOUD enough so that we can't choose to ignore it anymore? Yes, your honor. (on the phone) Well when do you expect her...? When do you expect her? Okay, well so I don't have to call a ninth time, will you take down what I'm sayin', word for word...? Okay, you got a pencil? You ready? Okay, here goes: "Mrs. Miller- Exactly how fuckin' stupid do you really think I am?" You didn't hurt anybody. You helped a lot of people. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 95. And this piece of paper makes everything okay? No, it makes it easier. You worried I'm gonna say something? No. Robert, look: you asked me to come meet you and I'm here, but I came because I wanted to get something straight between us: we're even. Okay, we're even. But just for the record though, what you did... (picks up the trust document) Was way beyond the money. Nothing's beyond money for you. Thanks a lot. (pointing to the document) And if I take this, then what does that say about me? Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money and do something good with it. Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna get there...? I don't wanna get there too soon... (tying his tie) You okay? What is it? Did she tell you that? Yeah, I explained to Brooke that... Yes. What? (he's had enough) What about me? What about the complaints? The unhappiness? The drinking? The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. How do you think I've paid for them? It's cause you didn't want to give `em up! No, I kept her out. What is this? "All ownership and voting rights transfer to the Miller Charitable Foundation, to be administered by Brooke Miller?" Did you really expect me to sign this thing? Apparently not, no. No. Yeah, this leaves me with nothing. This is fuckin' crazy. You're out of your mind. I am not signing that. I will not sign that! That's fucking ridiculous! What... (crosses close to her) Are you trying to blackmail me? You're not gonna win that one. There's no fucking way. Fucking lawyer... Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this! You won't do it. You won't do this. You won't do it to the kids. It's how it all works, Ellen. You know that. She'll be better for it. The world is cold. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 101. Speak, John. Who authorized this? (after a beat) And what did you conclude? I didn't ask you what the paper said, John. I asked you what you thought. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 102. I think... I think... that I don't see anything wrong here.
