I'm a Love Rhino... Maybe. I may have an important call coming in too, so... They both know he has no important call coming in. What the shit?? Does this tooth look dark? Like a little darker than the rest? I wasn't smoking, I just found it. I think it's beautiful. A beat passes. Then, Jesse pulls over. Well, your appointment is not until noon and this is that place with the deadstock vintage Italian fabric. I thought it would be good for the guest room windows. Celeste is truly touched by the gesture. Whassup, muthafucka?? Celeste rolls her eyes and gets out of the car to look at fabric. (covering the phone) Sorry, I'm on the phone. It's important. Really? I just...don't know what to say. Thank you so much for calling me. Well, sometimes things are just meant to work out. No, but Celeste... Why shower? Right, right. Aw, so wrong. Love you too. He promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature "C and J" hand sign. She flashes it back. He zooms off. Did you end up going to see that band at Spaceland last week? Oh, The Injured Saint? Yeah, dude. They are real. You know what? They should be your wedding band. They're loud but they're affordable. I told you, I'm not doing it. Swing is so late 90's, honey. Yawh. But I em murdering zeh creme brulee alooooone. No sharrrrring. Ve know zeh end of zat story. Yawh we doooooo! Yeah, what do you mean? Beth... It's weird. Let's not play charades anymore. Yeah, you guys should be thrilled about this. You'll never have to pick sides. Bett iz zo angry. Yeah, you guys are weird. I can't do this. It's fucked up. Tucker gets up and leaves. Jesse and Celeste watch him leave and sip their wine quietly. C, look...uhhhh! Celeste looks at him. She joins in. She reaches over and pushes in on the tube. Vaseline comes out of the top. This looks a lot like a penis ejaculating. Crazy. No, of course not. You're my best friend. Yeah, that was 6 weeks of torture. I mean, the anti-gravity training was insane but I missed you. Me too. Celeste walks to her front door with her key and Jesse heads towards the side gate with his key. It is now obvious that he is living in her guest house. Oh, it's fine. I'm fine. He keeps walking. He turns again to Celeste. For me too. Got it. Night. Love you. Large coffee, please. Oh. Sorry, I didn't know. I'm in a rush. Well, she was looking at the pastries, I didn't think she was ready to order. Have a nice day. Who's that? You're only done when you're done. You and Jesse are clearly not ready to let each other go. And there's nothing wrong with that. Well, to be honest... Celeste looks at an e-mail her blackberry and interrupts. Yeah, that's why I wanted you to come in. It's a huge account.. Well, you and I may not have a company if we don't take Riley Banks. Recession, remember? She is releasing a new album. She wants us to do the branding and merchandising. We need to take this account. If you are looking for my opinion, I do think you should start dating. No one has a 25 year plan. Except for my mortgage company. I'm fascinated with the mentally ill. Well, do me a favor and get your fuck on before you meet the next guy. Celeste looks at Scott in shock. Sorry, I was trying to be your saucy gay friend. It didn't feel good. The economic climate is real bad, man. And I think my business is taking the hardest hit of all. It's brutal. And no one's talking about it. You sell pot. Not for long, dude. Have you been to those weed pharmacies? They're killing me. I gotta branch out. Maybe start working in methamphetamines? Or maybe teach pre-school. I always wanted to do that. I love kids. Skillz is distracted by something. I don't think it's over. What? Her butt? No, it will never be over. It goes on forever. It's like space. So great. No, Celeste and I. I think she's just confused and overwhelmed right now about everything. But she'll come around. She always does. Uh oh. It's been a while now. I think it's over, bro. It may be time to accept that and move on. Call that dime Veronica. That was a one time thing, a couple months after Celeste and I broke up. Celeste does not know about that. And we will keep it that way. Didn't know that was a hit and run. Sounded like you liked her. Well, she's not Celeste. It's always been Celeste. I'm not ready to give up. Okay, but remember, you can't re- heat a souffle. Huh? Also, there's Bettys everywhere. It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind Celeste that you can pull wool. Make her sweat a little bit. It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go out with somebody. They reach the front of the line. Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I don't want to start all over again. I want everything that I believed to have been true to be true. I also want a goji berry/green tea swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity Pebbles. Please. (to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go out on a date with my friend here. Well...we're separated. Yeah. Matthias' wife died in a car accident last year. And he dedicated his gold medal to her. The human spirit is...unbreakable. Jesse is choked up, can barely speak. Huh? Oh yeah, I'm almost done. I'm working on it. I think you'll really like it. Celeste, can you sit down for a minute? I have something really important to tell you. I don't know how to tell you this but...I have a date tonight. I'm gonna start dating. People. It is? You don't... That doesn't bother you? Wow, okay. Well, it's actually the Yogurt Girl. From Yoga Yurt? Super young. Her body is all-time. Well, it's just a date. Thanks? Huh? Yeah, sure. What? Oh. I don't know, is it weird? Anyway, this is what we're doing right? We're getting divorced and we're friends and we're also dating people? That's what we're doing? Okay mom. There you guys are...you're on Oprah's Book List?? That's so great! Veronica? Good, good. You look great. Slowly, but it's going. No, that's means a lot, thank you. Oh sorry, Veronica, this is Beth and Tucker and Celeste. Oh you too. Take care. That was uh...Veronica. No story. Just this girl I met a while ago. Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what I neeeeeed... And you say he's just a friend, and you say he's just a friend.... Oh baby youuuuu.... Oh baby youuuuu.... Jesse's iPhone rings. A very flirty picture of Celeste comes up. No, no, no. Ignore for sure. Uh, I just need to...(picks up) Hey. (whispering) Nooooo! (talking to Celeste) Uh huh. Okay. Okay. No, I'm not busy. (hangs up) Uh, I'm gonna go home. Come on, after the show it's the after party. There's an Ikea dresser that she needs me to "build." Skillz takes this in. He is impressed. Huh. Really, cowboy? Are you guys... I told you pal, I know what I'm know I'm doing. She just needed time. Oh baby youuuuu.... Well, how hard can it be? It's a dresser, right? Fuck me!!! Do you think they intentionally pick a random piece of furniture to make totally unbuildable, just to fuck with you??! Wait. I got it. Fucking lay-up. We reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling that should have been the dresser. They both slide to the floor in satisfaction. They look at their "artwork." They laugh; they are pretty drunk. ...meets Serra meets Corky from "Life Goes On." Cherish. That is so cute. They share a laugh. I love you. Celeste does not respond. She pops up out of bed. We should talk about this. Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I love you. Only to...god, I'm so stupid. He realizes how pathetic it sounds. You thought what? You know, there's a guy that you can call, from Ikea, that will build you're dresser. You should call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck you too. I'm a fucking idiot. Hello. I said hello. (a little too loud) How was your practice? I see you in class a lot. You have a great warrior two. Are you single? Yeah, I can't believe it either. I don't do this, it's just happening, I can't stop...it...what do you do? Paul. Here's my card. Look, you're really pretty. I'm not good at this. Help. Not really. It's not cool. Did you ever tell me what you did for a living? Well, will you? I'd love to know. Trend forecaster. Really? Huh. They have reached the parking lot. Celeste turns to him with purpose. (on the phone) Hey. You're back. I want to talk to you. Really? Like subtitles or dubbed? Wait, actually, I'm really close to your house right now. Can I come by for a minute? It's....important. Okay. I have to tell you something. No, not gay. He takes a really deep breath. I'm having a baby. I'm having a baby. I am having a baby. Yes. With another person. With Veronica. You actually met her. That day at the book store. Well, the truth is, I slept with Veronica three months ago. It was just a one night thing. But she's pregnant. No, you don't have to do anything. Yeah I know her. I mean, I'm getting to know her. And I really want to make it work with her. I've actually been seeing her, well, a lot, recently. And I think I really like her. The universe is fucking weird, Celeste. I slept with her months ago and never called her after. But we started hanging recently and she told me she was pregnant with my child. I know it's crazy, but it just feels...right. It was like this really weird retroactive gift. I don't know... Right. Look, I know this is so sudden. And so weird. I've been holding on to us, this idea of us, for so long. And I know you've wanted me to let go. So I'm sorry. You were right, we're friends. We will always be friends. And I need that now. Thank you. Love you. Jesse gives Celeste a big, long hug. Hello? What are you doing? I don't...know what that means. Okay saucy. You don't have to be so saucy. Whoa. Wow. Did you even know he was seeing someone? I don't know what to say. I am so sorry, Celeste. Are you? Well, it's great that you're so resolved about this but it's also okay for you to have feelings. It's very sudden. Um...that's great. Who's the guy? I agree, go be admired. Who knows, you may actually even simulate human emotion. Well, actually I... Suddenly, Celeste catches a glimpse of Jesse, sitting at the bar, by himself, watching tv. She is not prepared for this. Wait, what? I don't think...really? I just wanted to say hi. I'm Jesse. Max. Max. Nice to meet you, Max. Cool. The puttanesca special is the thing to get. Good to know. I ordered that. Oh, just here alone. Watching the Lakers. Kobe-LeBron tonight, right? Yes. Epic. So psyched I tivo'ed it. Nice to meet you, man. Good to see you, C. He's cool. How was that? Are you okay? What? Bread? Um, yeah, I like bread. Um, I don't think we should. No, I think you may need some time. To get over, you know, your divorce. It took me a long time to start dating after mine. Well, have a good night. Good luck. Max gets in his car and is gone. Celeste stands there, confused and alone. She shakes him off. I wrote that for my mum. He provides me with the happy smoky green treats. Hello, Special One. Ugh. My hair is so dry. It looks like straw. Savannah quickly pops a pill. Then offers one to Riley. No, that shit makes me feel like a robot. Speaking of robot, who the hell designed this place? It's like Spock and his eyebrows are about to walk around the corner. Hey. Wow, you're pretty. Ugh, maybe it's my skin regime. Sorry? Thanks, Scrabble. Nice to meet you. Celeste has some ideas for the logo which are looking really great. He looks to Celeste who is not paying attention. She is busy learning that she was right and Riley was wrong. Celeste looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at Riley. Riley catches her and looks away uncomfortably. Hello, Special One. Sounds so awful. Wait, wait. You've never met Nick, right? Nick Moran? Yeah, we went to school together. This could be perfect. (he sings back) Trust meeeee. You will liiiiike hiiiim. Also, I love cooo-ooock. I waited seven hours. Three of them soaking in my own pee. But I finally got the shot of Ahmadinejad. He hands her a photograph. He is. I think the piss stain running down my jeans made him laugh. I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I didn't win. (looking at his watch) Oh my god, we missed our reservation. It was at 8:30. Should I call down and see if they can still take us? Perfect. Um, yeah. So, what are you doing for the rest of your life? (whisper)What do you think I'm doing? Shhhhh. Celeste pulls away slowly, shaking her head, "no." Nick keeps going. Eyes closed. Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhh! Nick recovers from his climax and looks around to realize she's gone. Hi. What's up? I'll get the veganchilada with the cashew cheese sauce on the side. Oh can I look at the seaweed menu? She hands him a tiny piece of recycled paper. How are you? You look great. Oh yeah, they're vegan. A lot of pilates. Yeah, well, Veronica's a dancer and has equipment at our house, so... Good. Great. Celeste, I never wanted to hurt you. Look, I actually wanted to see you because...apparently there's some kind of hold up on your side with the divorce papers and Veronica's actually not a citizen so.. Uh, Belgium. What? Point is, we need to...get married. I'm sorry. I really need you to sign those papers. I'm sorry. I know. I guess I'll have to figure it out. Veronica is really supportive of my work. That's true. And thank you. You had reservations about having kids. Well, ditto. I think Veronica will be a really good mother. Um, yeah. I do. We're doing Car Bombs in the kitchen. Wanna come? What are you? (doesn't get it) Huh. Paul (from yoga) enters to grab some ice from the freezer. He is wearing a black shirt covered in mini cereal boxes with plastic knives through them. Celeste is mid-Car Bomb and wasted. Celeste? Yeah, I haven't seen you there for a while. I can see that's important to you. (referring to the Car Bomb in her White trash? Um, a cereal killer, obviously. By the way, you were right. About me. All of it, the car, the phone, the yoga. Except that I did go to an Ivy League school. Cornell. I know. At parties. (Playful) Sorry about that day at the gym. I feel really open after yoga... I'm kidding. I only go to yoga to meet girls. Speaking of, what's the deal with you and me? Is this happening? Or... I'm sorry, that sounds tough. And you're right. Now what? Well do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? No one has ever given a more self- righteous monologue wearing only a trash bag. Except for maybe the homeless guy outside my dry cleaners. (yells to Celeste) Call me! What? Why did you say that? Veronica studies Jesse's face. No one's ever said that to me. This is...so weird but I just realized...what's your middle name? I don't even know it. They laugh a little. Goldleaf? Sweet. Mine's Mordechai. Means I'm really Jewish. Veronica giggles. They're getting to know each other. It's awkward...but sweet. Celeste? What...are you doing? But why were you in the trash can? In the trash can? You've met Veronica, right? Is that mine? Uh, I live in Westwood. In a condo. You are gonna love this place. You've never felt so relaxed in your life. Cherry and Lucky enter, the masseuses. They all exchange quiet hellos and head nods. Cherry and Lucky get to work. Lucky takes Celeste's leg and pushes it all the way over her head, not the most comfortable position. Yeah, I take all my dates here. You are. They all are. Celeste giggles. Paul takes a deep exhale as Cherry rams her elbow into his shoulderblade. You know what? I'm happy you did. At that moment, CRACK! Lucky has Celeste in a bear hug and it looks like she may have broken her back. Just wait. Trust me, you need this right now. But how do you feel? Celeste takes a beat to see how she feels. So shut up then. Don't try to control me. You need to let go. In yoga, we call it vairyaga. He strikes a reverse triangle yoga pose in the parking lot. You sound surprised. I'll get us beers. Celeste takes in the atmosphere for a moment. She is happy to be out. She takes her hair down, puts her hands through it, trying to look a little better. What was that for? Jesse, Skillz and Tucker with their arms up, cheering loudly. Oooh...toe touch basket toss coming up...degree of difficulty 9. Gnarly.......nailed it! Way to go, Becky!!! Jesse is look at his iPhone. He is looking at "Veronica and Jesse Baby Registry" What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn? It's a very, very tiny Swedish man. It's a baby carrier that allows your child to benefit from parental intimacy without the confinement of a stroller. Duh. Why do you know that. Beth. We go to a lot of baby showers. I put a lot of babies in the ladies. A parent of a cheerleader looks at trio with disgust. Jesse is still going through the registry list. Birthing towels, breast pump, Diaper genie? Fuck, I'm definitely having a baby. (beat) How's Celeste? She's...oh-kay. I'm fine-tuning her cannibus levels right now, just trying to find the right balance. Celeste doesn't smoke pot. She does now. She loves it. How's Veronica? She's so sweet. Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's probably just hormones. But are you into it? Yeah, I really like her. She seems great. For someone that I don't really know that's having my baby. MY JAM! Are you scared? A little. Yes. That's great. You should be. Just keep saying "yes." I'm really proud of you. She's like my top client now. Step out of the shadows and into the light. Are you crying? What? Day by day, C. You need not trip. Celeste takes a drag. Who? Jesse and Veronica? You know, they're oh-kay. Jesse is trying. It's not all rainbows and unicorns but... I didn't say that. I really like the logo. The I.M. Pei influence is pretty cool. Are you mocking me? Why, because I'm a pop star? You know what your thing is? Contempt prior to investigation. You're convinced you're smarter than everyone and THAT is your dark little prison. I started smoking again. I don't know what the rules are and I'm sure I'm breaking them but...god, I really miss you. Celeste tries to digest this. Veronica is friends with the assistant gallerist there and he just really loved my stuff. I don't know, we'll see... Yeah, yeah. It's great. Why doesn't he seem happier? He knocks back the rest of the drink. Can we just...lay here for a bit? Celeste lays down and Jesse spoons behind her on the couch. They hold each other. There's a long drag of silence. We have a massive problem on our hands. I need you in the office. Now. (referring to the logo) It's a penis. And a butt. You can't be serious. (points to the logo) There's the penis. And there's the penis going into the butt. Well, it's not a stretch, Celeste. Scott puts a DVD into the DVD player. A reel of news clips comes on. Celeste, what did you do. How could be so careless? Celeste picks up the magnified logo again. (fuming)Stop it. Stop laughing. No, this is not a joke. Our company's in serious danger. Get out. I can't, with you, right now. I have to deal with this. I'll call you soon. Her laughter fades and she exits the conference room. Hey. We gotta talk. Celeste... I'm sorry. I can't. Jesse gets up and leaves. I don't know. I made a mistake. I shouldn't have come. I'm just trying to do the right thing with Veronica. I'm trying to change. To be honest, you didn't really let me. Yeah, and I was never your equal. And you know what? I think you preferred it that way. And how do you define success, Celeste? Because you don't look very successful right now. What do you want? Wrong? Wrong about what? What did you want me to do? Wait for you to meet someone first? Is that how you saw it happening? I feel really sorry for you. You might be alone forever. Don't worry about it. Jesse walks away. Is she? I don't think so. Shit'll get better. J-Thunder? He's not doing anything to you. You wanted a divorce. When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves. Oh. It's Victor Frankl. I gotta go before Petco closes. No, but I gotta get a toy for this girl's cat, you know, so she'll give up the kitty. No. No. Yes. Enough questions. I'll pick you up at noon. Beth and Tucker's pre-wedding BBQ? Hey, easy on the herb until then. That shit is powerful. We only have Mimosas and Shandys. I'm gonna get her out of here. I need to talk to you. Come to my house. Now. Just, shut up for a minute. Riley is in tears. Nobody knew. He didn't want anybody to know. Fucking ass hole. And now, my career might be over because you put a penis in my logo. Thank you for that. Riley is clearly destroyed. Are you crying? Celeste turns off the television. A guy? You miss him? They all fucking suck. So it never gets better? I now pronounce you husband and wife. Tucker and Beth kiss. Everybody explodes in applause. We see Celeste in the audience, clapping. She looks beat down and tired. I know this may not the best time to talk about this...but...at some point, we will have to talk about Tucker's dance moves. INSERT of Tucker dancing on the dance floor. It's unexplainable. It's shocking how terrible it is. Wow. Wow. Your speech was really...beautiful. Thank you. I know. Aw yeah! Fuck! Hey. What? Nothing. We're just... (keeping score on a notepad) So, that's 38 points plus 50 bonus points for using all my tiles so... Are you challenging or not? Well, I will tell you that Zooecia is a sac secreted by a compound organism but here you go. (he hands her the Scrabble dictionary) Look for yourself. Celeste finds the word, reads the definition and silently accepts defeat. Well, nothing lasts forever. I'm so sorry I beat you in Scrabble. You're right, I'm not. The making out gets a little hotter. Celeste is aggressive. Uh...I don't think we should... No, I don't think we should sleep together. Celeste pulls away from him. I just...I don't know. No, no believe me, I'm into it. I really like you. Because I think I might really like you. THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST WELL GOOD FOR YOU THEN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S OPENING NIGHT HERE. IT DOESN'T Excuse me, can you please tell your friend Riley that we worship her?? OMG, she's so pretty! A dick in a butt? Yeahhh! It's amazing. All of our friends are rocking it. It's like the gay Izod. How dare you, I'm a size 10 in tween. I have a slight frame. They walk away, offended. Celeste turns to Riley. She is being adored by gay men. I LOVE IT HERE!! Wow, you might have just turned the cock in the butt around. So, it comes with directions and it's actually really easy to assemble. Lemme go ask my manager. Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be...oh God give me a reason, I'm down on bended knee..ooohohhh ooooh I'm down on bended knee hee hee hee. They finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast with beers. Aw shit! Baby when I met you, there was peace on earth, I set out get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside. Soft inside? What the fuck? You do something to me, that I can't explain, hold me closer, and I feel no pain. Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication. What? Come on, we're so good together. Islands in the stream, that is what we are. Get in there!! This is my favorite part! I know I'm pitchy but I'm finding it. Sail away with me... What do you mean? Are you serious? Oh no. Why? What? Really? Celeste, I know. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I respect that. Live by will, not by force. You're only ready when you're ready, you know? Don't force it. It's just some yoga shit. But I do like you. I like you a lot. And when you are ready, if you're ready, call me. Celeste and Jesse sit across from each other with their respective lawyers. They are both dressed very well. The atmosphere is formal, tense. There is not a lot of talking but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point pens. CELESTE'S LAWYER, male, 40, speaks: Sign here. And here. And here. Celeste looks up, makes eye contact with Jesse and smiles uncomfortably. Oh, thank you. One more here. No, I actually found it digging through your trash. So...we're divorced! They high five. What are you supposed to do when you get divorced. You wanna walk for a couple minutes? I thought you hated them. I'm just feeling like maybe you were right. I am a fuck up. I don't know what I'm doing. My girlfriend left. Left me. She wanted me to tell her everything was gonna be okay and I couldn't. I don't know why but I just...couldn't. She wants to go back to Brussels. Do what? You do? For what? Oh, you're welcome. But I don't know if everything is gonna be all right. I do. Okay. Okay. Me too. Huh? Hey, I'm sorry for cutting. My dog's in the car and he's really thirsty. So, thanks.
