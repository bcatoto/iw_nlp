What, are you kidding me? Sundays? I love Sundays. I live for Sundays. The whole family's together. Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on. We're all watching the game. Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes, I was negative. You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did. I just didn't appreciate it, or you, before." I lost all that. I blew it. But you also blew it. We can get it back. We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now. I'm better now and I hope you are, too. And I'm Hey, I'll be there in a minute, okay? I'll be there in a minute. That's true love. Yeah, that's when I had long hair. People say I talk about my hair too much. And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far. He cut this side back too far trying to even it up. I didn't tell him to do that. I said, "Just cut it the way you cut it...." Once you get in the right frame of mind, I think anything's possible. I think we get, we so often get caught in this state of negativity and it's a, it's a poison like nothing else. Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly? Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. I guess everybody's leaving today! Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you. Pat told me all about you, how God made you rich in character, and you're the mighty oak that holds the household together, and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day when the Birds play. Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol. Bad combination. Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder. That was when I was an X-ray technician with my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it. That's when my hair was long, too. But my hair only grew when I was older. When I was younger, my hair didn't grow because my brother... Remember I told you about my brother, he had a Jheri curl, and I couldn't get a Jheri curl because my hair didn't grow long enough. I was so jealous of my brother... He's obsessed with his hair. It looks great now. You like it? It's good now. (as Pat touches hair) Wait, you're going the wrong way! All right, Mom, just hold on a sec. Mom, just listen-- I'm sorry, Mom. You okay? It's my fault. Pat didn't know. Pat didn't know. He's my friend, so he was rootin' for me. I'm havin' a disagreement with the hospital, but we're working it out. Take me back to the hospital, but take Pat home, he's fine. Trust me. You'll see, he's fine. It's my fault. Mom, can we stop at the library? I wanna read Nikki's entire English high school syllabus. Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself. Come on, tell me that one. You know something? It's nothing new. Your team does that all the time. They get close... ...and then they blow it. They got an inferiority complex. Because we are, we're America's Team. What's more American than a cowboy? What? Benjamin Franklin? You mean the guy with the... ...little glasses and the long scraggly hair? If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill, nobody... ...would even know who he is. I didn't even touch `em. Why are you--, don't blame me. No, I don't touch them. As a matter of fact, I don't know why you need so many. Hey, there she is! Look how beautiful! Hey. (awkward, unsure) Mm-hmm. It's right here. You still got yours? You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up? Yeah, and the court said-- Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay? Let it go. Dad, I'm in there because of the court. That's the agreement that we made months ago. It was a plea bargain with the courts. The lawyer, he instructed me, he said that what we should plead that, and then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out. Thank you. So what are you doing with yourself? How you gonna pay for it? What are you doing, Dad? You know what? Excelsior. Excelsior. It means you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take all this negativity and use it as fuel and I'm gonna find a silver lining, that's what I'm gonna do. And that's no bullshit. That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth. What the fuck?! Stupid fucking book! I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids. I mean the whole time -- let me just break it down for you -- the whole time you're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley... ...and he does. He does. He survives the war, after getting blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful? She's pregnant. And they escape up into the mountains and they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance -- they both like to dance with each other, there's scenes of them dancing, which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy. You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending. She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is. Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive? Let's have a good ending to the story?" Mom, for what, I can't apologize. I'm not gonna apologize for this. You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here. I was reading. I'm gonna go run now. I'll fix it when I get back. I don't wanna go to therapy. Is that song really playing? We have music sometimes. That song is killing me. Could you please turn it off? I can't. What do you mean, you can't? I don't have the controls. I'm sorry, I-- Is, is the speaker here? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay...I'm sorry. I'll fix all this, okay? That was a messed up thing you did, Doctor Patel. That's a messed up thing. I'm sorry, but that's.... Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're supposed to meet people, okay? Why don't you write that down in your, I don't know, your little book you write stuff down in. Bravo. It's a trigger. I'm not gonna take any meds, I should just tell you that right now. No, I'm not gonna take any medicine. It makes me foggy-- No, you will have to take medication. I don't want any meds, Doctor. Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay? My father is the explosion guy. I'm not that guy. He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list. I had one incident. But I'm ready. I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street. She just needs to take responsibility for hers. What's hers? Are you joking? Let's go back to the incident. I come home from work after I ...principal. I come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding. The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us. That's playing and I don't think anything of it. Which is odd, `cause I should have. ...ll of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the D-... ...panties on the ground and then- ...and I think, "Oh, that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower. What a perfect thing. I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there. We never-... ...pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history... And you know what he says to me? So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him to death. But now I get fucking chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so. Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true. It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh... Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time. Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening, which I do now. Sort of. I can't, Mom. I can't. Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that. Why would you call them? I don't, I don't feel good when I'm on them, Mom. I don't feel good. I'm so much clearer without them. Mom, they make me bloated. I don't like the way it makes me look. Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality. I've been workin' out, that's what I'm doin'. To sweat. I don't believe in juju, Dad. All right, all right. For a second. I'll watch the beginning of the game. What's that in your hand? Handkerchief? That's OCD. That's crazy. I'm the reason? I don't think so. Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes. I got your whole sheet. Yeah. No, no... Mom. ...I'm just confirming. I'm just confirming. Okay. Can I do..an interview for a school project on mental illness? Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it? Is he the guy who's having the problem? No, you shut the door in his face. I'm going for a run. Ms. Meckers! Nance! This is my lucky day! Look at you working on a Sunday! How are you? Hey. I just came by to say hi, to let you know I'm ready to come back to work. I'll work full-time, half-time. I'll sub, I'll work history, whatever you want. Here, let me give you a hand. I'm sorry. I'm being rude. Let me ask you something. Let me just ask you something. Does Nikki still work here? Why would you tell me that? You know he broke up my marriage. What, are you being, a troublemaker? I did, yeah. I did. Thank you. I'm better. I just want to let you know, I'm better now. Okay? I'm better. I feel good. I feel so good. Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are. I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a positive guy. Okay? Yes. Yes! It will be! I'm gonna take that as a silver development, Nancy! A silver development! That's a silver lining! Ronnie! Pat. There he is! He's back! Hey. Welcome home. Thank you. Welcome back, man. Yeah, I'm out. Yeah? You're out out? Uh-huh. Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of weight. I almost didn't recognize you. Thank you. I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital. You know, work's out of control, you know, she had the baby. I'm really glad you're back. I missed you. I really need someone to talk to. You gotta come see the baby. She's beautiful. And Veronica wants to make dinner for you. Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation. 'Cause you think Veronica still hates you? I know Veronica still hates me. That's not true. Yes, it is. Nikki always said that "Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse." That's not true. Okay, it's a little true. But if you think she still hates you, you're wrong because why would she tell me to invite you to dinner? Hmm? Yes. I don't know yet! (to Pat) Can you make it next Sunday? Sure. I'll see you next Sunday. Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right? Does Veronica still talk to Nikki? Yeah. Okay. I have very, good news, everybody. Very good news. Things are looking up. You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it. Oh, no way! No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper? Wait just a minute. What are you doing? Give me the phone. Dad, this is my life. Dad. Don't talk to me like that. ...check on this house. Pat Solatano? Yeah. Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh. I work this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order. And I heard you went to your old house and the school. It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case, so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favor. Respect the restraining order, okay? Five hundred feet. Yeah, Dad, I know. If you need anything...my card. Since when do cops have cards? Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication. Let me say something, I gotta say something. This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining. Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for.... I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles. DeSean Jackson. Well, that settles that. Pat! What are you doin'? I gotta go, man. Why? I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake, I shouldn't have worn this. Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey. I wish I was wearing that jersey. I feel like an idiot. Are you comfortable? Veronica's not gonna like it. Get over here. Plus you got a tie on. Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor. You come however you wanna come. Really? Get over here. DeSean Jackson's in the house! Yeah. Isn't it awesome? Look, he got us flowers. And wine. Hey. Check this out. We just redid the whole thing. Wow! You start snapping up commercial real estate -- cheap -- flip it over, you flip it over and that's when you make the money. But the pressure...it's like.... You okay? I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody. Listen to me. I feel like I'm getting crushed and-- Crushed by what? Everything. The family, the baby, the job, the fucking dicks at work, and it's like, you know, like I'm trying to do this, (Ronnie reaches for his throat, mimicking trying to breath) you know, and, and, and I'm like...suffocating. Holy shit. You can't be happy all the time. Who told you you can't be happy? It's all right. You just do your best, you have no choice. That's not true at all. You just can't. Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie! I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over. You okay with that? Who? Veronica's sister. Tiffany. Tiffany and...Tommy? Yeah. Just Tiffany. What happened to Tommy? He died. Tommy died? Cops die. How'd he die? Please, don't bring it up. No, how did he die? Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat. Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany. You look nice. I'm not flirting with you. I just see that you made an effort and I'm gonna be better with my wife, I'm working on that. I wanna acknowledge her beauty. I never used to do that. I do that now. `Cause we're gonna be better than ever...Nikki. Just practicing. How'd Tommy die? What about your job? Oh, really? How? I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen? Great, great. Come on, let's go for the tour. (motions to Pat) Come on. Oh, it's a television. Nope. It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven. Where would the dead body...where would the body go, though? `Cause the outside of the-- Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone. They won't let me make any calls. They think I'm gonna call Nikki. Don't worry about it. Don't focus on that. I would call Nikki. I'm actually gonna give you one of my iPods. I have an old one. Can you play "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica? Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany. Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all. Here's a fun fact. You know where the term "OK" comes from? Where? Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York... ...and he was part of a club, a men's club, called Old Kinderhook. And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK." `Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks. Really? Yeah. Pretty cool, right? That's interesting. You ever take Klonopin? Right? It's like, "What? What day is it?" How about Trazodone? Oh, it flattens you out. I mean, you are done. It takes the light right out of your eyes. You mean me? You have poor social skills. You have a problem. I tell the truth. But you're mean. Um, maybe I should drive them home separately? Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping! Sorry, man. How what works? How old are you? Look, I had a really good time tonight and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay? No, that's confusing. He's dead. Wait, what? What's happening? Oh, my God. Hey. I don't know, Mom. When am I gonna get a phone? Mom! I can't find my wedding video. Mom, wake up. Where's my wedding video? I looked in here, but this is all your sewing shit up here, for your sewing and everything. Did you put it up here? (shouts O.S.) Dad, not now! Would you put it in here? It makes no sense for you to put it in here. He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding! Is it here? I mean....? It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video. I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated because I should have my fucking wedding video! I looked over there! I already looked all over there! I'm not calming down! I don't give a fuck who hears, I'm not calming down! Anybody can wake up! I'm not ashamed of it! I'm not ashamed of it! Let the whole neighborhood wake up! I... ...don't care! No, Mom! (yelling and crying) I want it! It-... Hey! (yelling and crying) It's my wedding! It's my wedding video! I can't watch my wedding video, but I CAN hear the fucking song in my head, goddamn it! Mom? What the fuck you doing?! You... Mom? No, no, no, no, no! Get off me, Dad! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Police! There are a lot of reports from your neighbors, we got a lot of phone calls. Nikki is being manipulated and controlled. You have to talk to her. Hey, sit down. Oh yeah? He's fine now? You wanna send him back to Baltimore? We know all about the explosion at the psychiatrist's office. What explosion? No. Cliff is lying, that's not true. He's not allowed to talk about that. Is this a bipolar episode? Someone, help me! Help me! You can't tell Nikki about this, Officer. Look, I gotta make out a report. No, no! No! She can see it by law. Sit down. No, no, no, listen, sir. He's chasing me! This guy's chasing me! Help me! Sit down! I'm sorry. I could just write you a letter and you could just let me have five minutes, explaining how much better I'm doing. There's a court order against you -- five hundred feet. Listen to me! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ...this is not a reflection of where I'm at. You can't...please, you can't tell her any of this You can't tell Nikki about this. You need to pipe down. Who was that, Dad? Good luck. I gotta write this up. Come on, don't write it up! I don't want her to see this! What the hell? Weight lifting accident. Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off. I like to run by myself, okay? (stops and turns) Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop? Okay? I'm running here! Well then, why don't you run somewhere else? There's a fucking ton of roads to run in! What are you trying to do? Oh, come on, please! What the fuck?! I'm married! What the fuck are you doing? Your husband's dead! You're crazy! I'm not the big slut! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean.... Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best. Yeah, but that's easier said than done. Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay? Why? Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question? With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts? No, not the books. How do you know when I run? No, I'm not giving you a hard time. You wanna have dinner at this diner? Happy Halloween. I'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran. You look nice. You want to share this? Why did you order tea? I ordered Raisin Bran because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date. It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing? I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office. Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well. It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me. I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher... ...it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing. Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of. So I know. I just gotta get a strategy, you know? We'd better get back to the letter. What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom? Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now. Because, it's just not right, lumping you and I together, I mean, it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't like that. Especially after all the shit you just told me. Keep your voice down. Shut the fuck up. Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany! Hey, come on. Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right? No, I don't. What? Hey, calm down! Hey-- Can I just explain myself, please? I didn't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because I've never done anything like that, okay? Hey, hey! Shut up! Take it easy. Dude, relax. Bro, get off of me. Hey, hey, stop, stop. Stop, all right? Hey, get off of me! Shut up, shut up. Stop it. Hey, hey, hey, get off me! What are you doing? Come on. What are you doing? What are you doing to these kids? I didn't, I didn't, I didn't-- (walks crowd back) Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (pulls her away) Hey, is he messing with you? There's a restraining order on this guy. That's not a good thing to do. You're Tommy's widow, right? You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime? She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore. I'm sorry about what I said in the diner. I didn't mean it at all. All the time. Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany. You do? I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter? I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing. Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of `em took it. That's the only answer. Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes. I hope that's not a Guys, I'm beating the song! I'm on the scoreboard! I'm playing down field! I feel great! Tiffany! Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany here? Is that another creep? What do you want, creep? Just beat it. Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married. Oh, great, a married creep. I'm her friend. We go running. Have you guys not seen us? I took her to the diner. Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey. Is Tiffany home? I know her. I know her, we've dated. We still date. What are you doing here? I've called her, I've texted her. Do you know this guy? I still haven't heard back. We used to work together-- Just get the hell out of here... I just wanted to give you my card to give to her. Another rude creep. Listen to what he's saying. Listen to what he's saying. What's he saying? He's saying you're being rude. How am I being rude? Oh, you know. You know. Come on. Sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun and --it's not because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt, and they're an easy target. And in this case, in this particular case, I think that wing is being fixed. And you gotta make sure it gets mended. And you're gettin' in the way of that right now, okay? Because she's sensitive and she's smart, she's artistic. This is a great girl and you gotta be respectful of that. Come on. Let me walk you down to your car. You're a better guy than this. I can see it in your eyes. She just texted me! Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened? How come you weren't outside? What the hell's going on? What do you mean, you can't do it? You can't do what? Tiffany, what are you talking about? What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki? You said! You said if I wrote a letter, you'd get it to Nikki. That was the set-up. What are you talking about? You seem like you're a tough girl to me. Why don't you just do things on your own? Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you? Tiffany, what do you want me to do? Think of something. There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing? It's a dance thing, all right. Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not gonna fucking do it. I don't have a filter when I talk. Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you. What are you talking about? Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you. Wait a second! But you promised you would do this. Well, I already did do something for you, you know. I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house. Let me ask you something. Do you call him when you're lonely? That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it. It's not at all like me and Nikki. What are you talking about? We're in love and we're married. It's completely different. We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel awkward, but not me. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with. It's electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me. She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good thing. You know? I just, look, I'm my best self today, and I think she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing. I'm out. It's official, man. They didn't convert me to my Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence, so I'm out. They had to let me go. I never understand what he's saying. What a treat! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad's got you sitting here? He calls me "Jailhouse Lawyer." Okay. And now you're holding the remote? And it's working. Your dad's a genius. And Danny's the good luck charm? Yeah, you're the one, Pat. Superstition, Danny. I don't know. Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend. Why would you say that? Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful. She goes to a lot of therapy. I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie. What are you trying to say? I'm just saying-- Why don't you stop judging people? You judge everybody. You're the one who has a messed up marriage. I'm just looking out for you, I'm just looking out for you. She's unstable. Nothing's wrong! You should have seen when I was at his house. It's like a circus over there. Shh, shh. What are you talking about? I'm not gonna hide this. You need to deal with it. Stop breaking my balls. Oh!!!! I got you an iPod. Whoa! Is this for me? (scrolling through iPod) Yeah, but it makes me feel better. It's like my therapy, you know? When I'm with Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that... A restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro. [Walks down to Pat]. Holy shit, look at you! You are fit! You look absolutely amazing. You feel good? How you doing, Jake? Good. You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime. So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital. You know how those places creep me out, and the firm's been expanding. I've been helping Pop with the restaurant `cause he needs to have a legitimate business. He needs a tax return. With all the money that he's making with his bookmaking, they're gonna come after him. And then it looks like I'm making, I'm gonna make partner at the firm. Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore. You lost your wife, I'm getting engaged, and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things. You lost your house, I'm getting a new house. You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm. You know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop talking. I'm gonna shut my mouth. As my friend Danny would say 00 I got nothing but love for you, brother. That's right. That's right. DeSean Jackson. Yeah. Did it fit? I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner. Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey. Veronica didn't like it. Veronica hates the jersey. Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay? I'm not doing anything! Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble. People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay? Did you ever think about that? Maybe we understand something because we're We have a sixth sense. I mean, everybody's got it. Everybody's just not in touch with it. How you doing, Pat? Jesus. I'm taking him back to the hospital. What? No, no, he passed his thing, right? First of all, check with the latest legal development. Well, we got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so.... Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan? I'm an Eagles fan. I don't know what the hell you're talking about "the handkerchief". And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright? He can contest his case from Baltimore. Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law. You're not correct. Come on. You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves. Wow. Where do you sleep? When are you gonna give it to her? The letter to Nikki. Really? Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph. I did this thing about Shakespeare and how it's very -and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing, I can be able to do that because of all the I assume you're a good teacher. Maybe you can teach us both, you know what I mean? And I also mentioned how generous it is, what I'm doing for you. You know, being of service. To your need. Can we do something else besides the dance deal? I'm good with a hammer. You want me to fix something? I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario. I'm not doing it. No. That's stupid. (under his breath) You're not Nikki. I don't feel anything. No. What? He wants me to have- -all this Eagles information. Um, tell Dad thanks. Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing? I'm behind on my syllabus. What the hell are you doing? Did you just throw that outside? Wow. That was a great synopsis. I still need to read it, though. Who's that? What the....? (laughing) What are you doing here, man? If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license, then your whole ajudication is thrown out. How'd you know we were here? I went by your parents' house looking for you and they told me you was over here. Danny, this is Tiffany. (to Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny. So is the girl, that you wrote about? Yeah. He wrote about you, all right. He said you guys was helping each other out and you were nice and had a mouth on you, that you were mouthy, but-- Whoa, whoa, that's enough. Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll just tell you. It was nothing. It was just a very general letter. (looks at Tiffany) She's fine. She is my friend with an "F." A capital "F." For "friend." Hey, can I see what you guys are doing? Yeah. That's it? Why? What is it, what is it, what is it. Can I say something? Do you mind? You sure? Just say it. Say it. I think Pat, you should be facing Tiffany. Let me show you, Pat, let me show you what I mean. You gotta come at her with a little bit more soul, man. You should move more hips. Just, just sort of come in, Pat, come in like this. And.... Okay. Yeah. Can you move `em a little bit more? Yeah, that's it. Move `em a bit more. You could turn around, too, there's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. You're pretty good. Mm, yeah. Okay, we got it, we got it. Okay. Okay. Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit more soul. Black it up, Pat. "Black it up"? You know damn well what it means. Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, man! I got an idea. Come get some, Pat. Come get some. Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle back, shuffle back. Girl, you gotta move your junk. I gotta get out of here. I gotta go see this girl, Tanya. She lives on this side of town. Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea. Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there, man. I want you guys to win! Excelsior, Pat! Excelsior! That's my man. I didn't realize that. Okay. Right. He's betting everything on the Giant game. Everything. All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game. Because he believes in you. Is that true? Yeah. You want me to go to the game with Jake? Does he want me to go? He told you that? Even with all his friends? He's not embarrassed? Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game. I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing. It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear. Listen, I need to ask you something. Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game? Why? I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay? And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because I'm spending time with you. No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games. What? Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--, it's in the back of my head. We don't almost have it, all right? Thank you. What was her energy when she gave it to you? She was scared? About what? Did she tell you? I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask? Okay. Sorry. "Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki." I think I'm done for today, okay? (over his shoulder) Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Can I use your phone? Yeah, kind of. Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany and I wanted to tell her I'm not gonna be on time. She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow Jake's phone. It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know, for beating everybody up. Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad? No, I think, it's a good thing. Yeah. I'm solid. This is my little brother Pat. Hey, how you doing? So, Pat, what's this I hear about you just gettin' out? (laughs) Yeah, from the looney bin! What the fuck?! I talked to you about that already! I told you guys-- It's all right. Huh? No. It's alright. He's a good dude! He's a good dude. Oh, shit! The Asian invasion! They're here every week! (can't believe his eyes) No! Uh, Jake you better get your brother. Cuckoo bird's takin' off. Doctor Patel! Hey! What are you doing here? I'm not supposed to be seeing you, right? Outside the office? That's illegal! Hey, Jake this is Cliff. This is my doctor, Cliff. Look, two things. We gotta watch that bubble screen for fuckin' Manning in the backfield and we gotta make sure we knock the receivers on their ass on the line of scrimmage. Okay, you know what? I don't have her phone number. If you want, if you really want, you can call Veronica `cause she does, but I don't want to talk to Veronica. Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica? Because she brings me down, man! She just brings me down. You have to change. You're not gonna throw the marriage away. There's some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it. You guys have a beautiful thing that got broken somewhere along the line and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor. You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment. Enough with awkwardness! I don't wanna walk in your house and not be able to say what I wanna say. You're right, man. You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, man. What, what's wrong? Hey! Whoa, whoa, what's going on? Stay back, Pat. Stay back. Leave the fucking Indians alone. Stay here, stay here! I'm not gonna go anywhere. Don't get in a fight! I'm not gonna fight. I'm not gonna fight. Hey, not my brother! Hey, hey, hey! Break it up or you'll be arrested! What the fuck happened? Dad. I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid now. No, Dad! It's all fucking ruined now! It's all fucking ruined! No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't! It's all ruined, you little fucking shit! No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing! Come on, Dad! You loser! You loser! I'm not a loser. Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany, She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts. Unbelievable. Wow. How did you know all that stuff? That's his team! When is the game? Oh, my God. Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing. Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good? We suck. And how are the people you're competing against? They're good? Better than you? A lot better. A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right? No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away-- We can't get five! I'm out. Here we are again at the one yard line. DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. There you go. What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on...I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry. If it's you reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay. "...but if it was me reading the signs...." Hey, what's up? Sorry I'm late. Come on, it's gonna be great. Nikki's gonna be there. You know? Everything's gonna come together. It's what's meant to be. You okay? Don't get wobbly on me. We have a dance to do. We have a parlay. You gotta stay focused. Okay, let's go. Look at the dancers. You see them? Dallas just tied with another field goal, three-three. I'm worried about the bet. I'm worried about the bet. Look at those fucking dancers! You can give me the money now, you know? Patty, Patty, all we have to do is we have to make a five. That's all. You stay here and watch the game with me. Relax, we're gonna do fine, okay? I'll see you in a little bit. I'll see you up there, okay? Hey, Pat, Tiffany! Hey. What a glorious, beautiful occasion, man. Yeah, yeah. All right, buddy, I'll see you. Alright. Wish me luck, man. (Notices he and Tiffany are holding hands) Wait, what's this? Oh, I thought you were doing it. We're doing a dance thing anyway, for God's sake. You okay? Of course I do. Hi, good evening. Evening. Check in? How many dancers are there? Pat told me. He told me you should never throw a marriage out the window. He said it several times, Tiffany, and this is his chance. You gotta give him a chance. Randy, what the fuck is happening, man?! I don't know, Mom. Have you seen her? I know, Mom, I know. Hey, WHAT are you doing? She's fine? Why don't you shut up, okay? How many drinks have you had? Listen, I don't know what choices you've made, but you gotta deal with it right now, okay? We're in this. Next, Pat Solatano and Tiffany Maxwell. Good for you. And the scores for Makarov and Tretiak are: six point seven, eight point one, seven point five and six point five for an average score of seven point two. They were great and they only got a seven point two. This is a tough room. Up next, ladies and gentlemen please welcome Pat Solatano, Jr. and Tiffany Maxwell. Damn. Let's go, Patty! Come on, Pat! Yeah, Pat! Yeah! We love you, Pat! Alright, let's see the scores for Solatano and Maxwell. We have a four point nine, four eight, a four nine... ...and and a five point four for an average score of..five point zero. Sorry about that, guys. What?! Come on! Dad, Dad, did the Eagles win? Come on! Why are they so excited about a five? We'll take a ten minute break. Thank you for coming. How are you? You okay? I'm really good. Yeah, thanks. Did I? Yeah, who'd have thought, dancing? Thank you. I've been reading your books and, I have a positive attitude. I'm on medication, I'm in therapy. Where's Tiffany? What do you mean, she left? Where is she? I love you, Dad. Hey! Wait a second! I have one more letter for you to read, okay? Let me say something. You don't ever have to see me again if you just read it, alright? Yeah, just read it. "...was by doing something crazy yourself. Thank you. I love you. I knew it the minute I met you. I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up. I just got stuck. Pat." I wrote that a week ago. Yes, I did. I was trying to be romantic. Yeah, I do. I'd like to do another parlay if we make it to the next round, that's all. No, that was me that did that. No that was me. That was me. I played the Jack. So you put the bread crumbs, the garlic in the steak and you roll it up with the toothpicks?
