It's me. It's Ali... I left. I took the kid with me. She can't take care of him anymore. I got into a fight with the guy she's with. I don't know where to go. What do I do with the kid? I can't talk. I don't have any more credit... Call me back! He hangs up quickly and turns to Sam. Move it! His phone rings. He immediately answers. Yeah! Where is it? Shit! It's so far! How do I get there? I don't know. Today or tomorrow. Yeah... Ali lifts Sam onto his shoulders with one arm. Sam is tiny, he looks like a squirrel on his father's back. I'm thirsty. We don't have any money. I'm thirsty! Stop it. Sam's Mickey Mouse sandals pause, then go back to their banging. I said to stop it. The sandals freeze. Cut. I don't know. A big street that started at the station. Yeah, by the beach. Behind? We just came from there! Ali pulls Sam away from one of the stairways that lead to the beach... I'm tired. So am I. He's coming to pick us up. Come on! Sam is extenuated. Ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder. (Southern accent)... A couple miles back I saw a blond guy. (Imitates screeching brakes) I stop short! "You Ali?" I ask. He says "No, me Kurt". Another few hundred feet, another big blond guy! (Screech) I ask "You Ali?" again. This time I didn't even understand what he answered. Another few hundred feet... Ten of them! Ten! Every Kraut and Flemish guy on the coast! So I go call your sister... Ali is thrown for a loop. (uncertain) You kidding? A little. (to Ali) Is he a little crazy? (to Sam) What? You don't like my truck? Yeah I do. (pretending to be shocked) He doesn't like my truck! I do too like it! Worked up, Sam shrieks, holding his hands over his ears: (screaming) I like your truck! The road hugs the seashore. Ali watches beaches, homes, a railway line pass by... Voice over, we hear Richard's We all got fired after some Spanish guy bought out the trucking company... Eight truckers. I thought it over, discussed it with your sister and figured I could do it on my own. So I bought this truck with my severance pay... Ali has finished his cream cheese sandwiches. He gets up and opens the old fridge. Oops, poor man, not those! She'll kill you! Start with the expired ones, on the top shelf! They're organized by date. First the top shelf, then move down.... Anna brings it home from the supermarket where she works. As soon as they reach their expiration date, those idiots throw it all away, even if you can still eat it for a week! (to Sam) You want some more? She didn't remember anything. It was already in there. She forgot about it, that's all. When they went to Amsterdam, they'd use the kid to smuggle dope... That's what she told me. Anna shakes her head in disbelief. A beat. I don't know. Um, no. (turns to Sam) You in school? No answer. Sam is watching TV. Yes. Yeah. It's not too much, but I don't have it. I had to pay for the train... I don't know. Find a job. Whatever. What should I have done with the kid? Where should I have gone? I don't know. She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house, calling Richard on the way. Ali hears Sam in the kennel, giggling in delight. He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special 50 moped, plastic junk, etc. Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights shining. Unzip your jacket! Empty your pockets! Ali keeps his cool. Unzip it yourself! Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly. The guard tries to punch him. Ali dodges: The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right hook. The guard stumbles. A kick in the face sends him flying into a stall. Ali lifts his arms in victory for the benefit of the few, stunned passersby. He kisses his own biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off. Hey! Here I am! Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who is sniffling, tears in his eyes. No need to cry. I wouldn't have left you all alone. Ali unlocks the moped. Are you happy here? Sam nods. Mm. What do you like the most at Auntie's? The dogs. Is that all? Nothing else besides the dogs? The truck. The dogs and the truck. The house? Auntie? The ocean? The dogs and the truck. Ali nods. Sam watches his Dad's fat fingers assemble the plastic toy from his Happy Meal. We have it good here... Ali's fingers stop. Sam looks up to find his father watching some girls in swimsuits go by. They go for a swim, horsing around and making noise. No criminal record? You never fucked up? No. The boss is in his fifties. He sits behind some files. His hair is short and white, it looks like he's wearing a helmet. He is squeezed into a cheap suit and wearing a tie. He stares at Ali. Is that the truth? We'll be checking anyway... Ali nods. The owner reaches out. Your papers... Ali hands him his tattered paper ID. The owner writes down the number. Ali is 13-14 on the picture. What was your last job? I worked in a slaughterhouse. Not for long. It closed. Ever work in security? Yeah. I was a night watchman in a stadium for 6 months. Working for the city. In a parking lot too. I did replacements. Ever do any combat sports? Karate, for 6 years. I even won Junior Division. And two years of boxing. Thai. You gave it up? It was my trainer who gave up. Why? He died. A beat. And how are you physically? You stay in shape? Yeah. You don't smoke? No. Drink? He shakes his head "no". The boss notes something in a file. Okay, I'll let you through because I'm outnumbered. Four against one, I don't stand a chance! The girls smile and disappear inside. Ali watches them vanish. You say something nice, anything. That way, when they leave, they remember you and you can hit on them. If they're a little plastered, if things didn't go too well for them, you're there with a nice thing to say... And it works? Sometimes. But you can't be dressed like that. Like a parking lot attendant... They are interrupted by the bouncer. (pointing) Fight! They go running. Three guys are fighting like savages. Ali and Foued clean house. Foued gets rid of gawkers. Ali delivers a few random punches, lifts one of the guys off Are you okay? Breathe out of your mouth. In and out. Put your head back. Walk a little. Walk and breathe... He demonstrates how and takes her by the arm, forcing her to walk. She looks groggy. You have friends here? You can't drive like that. You can't drive like that. I'll call you a cab. Bitch! Stephanie looks back. Yeah... you, you cunt. Bitch! She ignores him, pretending not to see him. She then notices the blood stains on her T-shirt. Where's your car? Still bleeding? Keep your head back. Wait... He manipulates the knob to push her seat back. He grimaces in pain. Shit! You often go to the Fever? Why do you go alone? No answer. To dance? To find a guy? She turns and looks down her nose at him: You're dressed like that just for dancing? I don't know... Look. He points to her skirt, riding up her thighs. You look like a hooker. How would you call it? What? Dressed like that, it's no surprise that... I don't know. She takes out her wallet. No, stop! Don't worry. Got any ice at your place? He shows her his wrist. Ice cubes. I can come up. So what? What the hell? What's going on? Are you okay? (pointing to Ali) Who's he? (introducing himself)... Ali. The Fever? What the hell were you doing there? Ali opens the refrigerator. What are you looking for? Ice cubes. If you decide to go out, call me. That's all! Who were you with there? I thought you went out to dinner. You get my text messages? Why didn't you answer me? Stephanie comes back into the kitchen. She has changed her T-shirt. She seems tense. Is that you in the picture with the orcas? Is that your job? Fuck... I didn't think that... (To Ali) Okay, are you done now? Can you leave us alone? Ali stares him down. You talking to me? It's as if Ali's calm, peremptory tone suddenly let Simon know who he was dealing with. Yes, but... But what? Nothing, forget it... In one second, Stephanie sees Simon's face undergo a metamorphosis, his nervous authority suddenly disappear. She glances at Ali as if to say ‘Please go now.' He gets up and wipes his hands on a dish rag. Okay, I'm going. So long. (pointing to a piece of paper on the table) I left you my number if ever you need it... Are you okay? Are you upset? Before? I piped down? Me? What does that mean? Coming? No answer. Tension. He leaves without a word. Louise looks up. She has been crying. Stephanie looks at her, impassive. Louise swallows her tears. Sam! No answer. There is some noise over at the kennel. He goes and finds Sam in the kennel, talking to the puppies. What are you doing here? You're gross! You stink! Who's taking care of you? Ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down. The water is freezing cold. Sam hops from one foot to the other and screams. Stop it, Dad! It's cold. Stop! Sam shrieks. An 18 year old tomboy wearing a skimpy tee- shirt comes out of a neighboring house: Joelle, the neighbors' daughter. Aren't you supposed to be taking care of him? What the fuck are you up to? Take a look at him! (to Sam, crying) Don't go in there. It's disgusting. You hear? Joelle takes Sam and disappears inside. Ali is drawn to the living room, when through the half-open door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel. Onscreen and behind the anchorwoman, he recognizes an inset photo of Stephanie, the same he saw at her place, riding on the back of a killer whale.  Il manque une phrase I know her. Sam pulls off his towel. He watches his father who is riveted to the screen, glued to the looping footage of the accident. (to Stephanie) Want me to tell you something? You haven't finished mourning, that's all! Your legs. Yes. He sounds as serious as a civics teacher. She looks at him, incredulous. Raphael sticks his head up front. Pass me the joint... Gilles' pincer and joint go for Raphael's lips. He takes a long hit. They were a part of you. When a man dies, he gets buried. There's a ceremony, a prayer... Now a piece of you ended up in a hospital trashcan without a prayer, without any time for meditation. A beat. She is dumbstruck. She cannot believe what she's hearing. In the backseat, Raphael exhales some smoke into Julia's open mouth. GILLES (cont'd) You have to think about it symbolically... I know where my arm is. We buried it under a nice oak tree behind my house in the scrubland. My wife and kids came and we sang... Stephanie has a fit of the giggles. (a bit vexed) You think I'm kidding? Shit, it's a laugh riot up there. (to Gilles) Can you take us home? She looks back and, between the seats, notices the girl toying with Raphael's fly. I'm too beat. I'll take a nap, then go. (to Stephanie) How are you getting home? What do you want? To come in. The guy takes out a card and presses it against the glass door: it's the business card of ALTA SECU, the security agency. Hey, Kadhi, come here! Kadhi comes over and looks at the guy. Okay, okay... Are you Martial? Yeah. Give me your keys. Who's he? It's fine. The boss told me he was coming. He works for the company. Ali hands him the bunch of keys. Will this do? Perfect. Put it down there. Martial climbs the ladder to place the box high on a shelf. Imagine you're the manager of a big store like this and the union reps have been busting your balls. What do you do? Fire them. You think that's how it works? What do you do before you fire them? He checks to make sure the lens is aligned with the hole, then checks the screen and reception on a small pocket monitor. Well, beforehand you try to see how long they spend in the restroom, if they take extra-long coffee breaks, smoke on the premises, steal from the stockroom, rip customers off with the sales receipts... When you know all that, you put the pressure on them and you fire the ones who don't leave. Can you give me a stroll down the aisle? A stroll? Walk down the aisle. No, further down, like you came out of that door there. Good, perfect... Ali twice passes within the camera's field of vision. Martial climbs down his ladder. That's it. Okay, then I'll be getting back. Hold on! Martial pulls a 10 Euro bill from a jacket pocket. It's fine. Take it. Angle on the bill in Ali's hand. Hello? Yeah... How are you doing? She sniggers. Her speech sounds slow and thick. Yeah... I saw the papers… the news on TV… How are you? Okay... normal. No, not really. Yeah, but nights are tough. I'm a security guard now. Three nights a week. Huh? No... I just got here. No. Yes. That's fine. It takes two tries to activate the wheels on her wheelchair. Need any help? She answers with a growl, as much for him as for her wheelchair, then goes into the kitchen. He sees her pajama legs flap like rags, he hears the noise of the tap. Have you been living here long? (looking around)... It's nice. She comes back. Are you alone? You got no one to help you? No, for the cleaning and everything... Hey, are you okay? Yeah, a little. Let's go out. (No answer) Hey, you hear me? Let's go out. Get dressed. Where are your clothes? He opens the closet. Here. Ali hands her a pair of sunglasses. Where should we go? Should we go to the ocean? I want to go in. I feel like swimming! You don't want to? You don't feel like swimming? She looks daggers at him. You don't have a bathing suit? Who the fuck cares? There's no one here! (makes a gesture)... How, like this? You okay? So? You swim like a real pro!... She shuts her eyes. Huh? I have to get back. I need to train. Ali nods, without actually looking at him. I'm still at the gym. I'm leaving... I said I'm leaving! He hangs up. They continue. Look at the next one! Watch how he whacks him. A change of scene on the small screen: a courtyard between two tower blocks, with new combatants, but with the same amateur images and the same violence. (pointing to the screen)... I know him. I fought him twice in Nationals. He's not bad. He was at the boxing club in Marseille. Martial watches Ali, fascinated by the images, as if he were sizing him up. He says he's done Thai boxing. He can fight. He's enormous. He's not afraid of taking punches, and he's white. I see. The cousin turns to Ali. He takes his time sizing him up. Is that true? You like to fight? Yeah. Okay, so I organize the fights. I pick the fighters. I see if the money's there. I ref. I collect the dough... I take a third of the bets. The rest goes to the winner... A third of how much? We don't fight for less than 800. Ali does the division in his head. So? Ali hesitates. (to Martial) There's something I don't get: how much do you take? I don't know. You tell me. How much do you need? I'll take 20% of what you win. How's that? And how much does your cousin give you? Oh, I introduced you to him, didn't I? How's that? Okay. The cousin stands up. They all shake on it. Yeah, I heard. He gets up and goes to get Sam who is playing behind the house. Anna finds her papers and leaves in another direction. Sam! Come here! I want to show you some stuff! He lifts Sam up with one arm and goes back to the computer. Look how they fight... He clicks on an image and the fight continues... the audience's noise as well. Sam watches, intrigued. Ali Look at him, in red. See how strong he is? Is he the good guy? No, he's the bad guy. Look how he tries to grab his legs. Wait. His phone vibrates. He takes it from his pocket. It's Martial. He answers. Hello? Yeah... Why is the red one the bad guy? Daddy? I don't know. Look and tell me who wins. He turns down the sound, settles Sam on the stool and gets up to go speak. (into the phone) So? What did he say? Which others? How many? Sam watches the fight in silence. Dogs bark in the garden. Sam feels something coming. He looks out the window, then goes running. Ali hasn't noticed a thing and continues his phone conversation. What is this bullshit? What do you mean, a tournament? Last one standing gets the money. I know, but he says it's better that way. Do you think you're in a position to negotiate a percentage? Where did you get that idea from? He gave me a website if you want to see the others. He takes out a small spiral notebook. Tell him to give the website to his mother. All I see is me doing more fights and him making more dough. Ali goes to the window. Outside, near the kennel, Sam has lunged at a guy in a jumpsuit who is helping Anna get the puppies into a metal cage. Sam is screaming. Anna tries to take him into her arms. Sam clutches the bars of the cage. The puppies bark. Anna finally manages to rip Sam free and drag him back into the house. (into the phone) He's changing the rules and so am I... I couldn't care less. Anna storms into the living room. Sam is shrieking, having a tantrum. He kicks and bites. I'm on the phone! (into the phone) I'll call you back. Ali hangs up. Leave me alone. They're my babies! Sam refuses to calm down. Anna looks at her brother. You're such a pain in the ass. Stop it now! I said stop! Calm the fuck down! Let go of me! Let go! Sam kicks out. Ali shakes him. Cut it out, dammit! You're such a pain! He flings the child away. Sam's head hits the coffee table. Silence. Anna rushes over and picks up Sam, who has stopped crying. He's been knocked out. Anna is frightened. She examines his scalp, she strokes his head. She trembles. A cut on his head begins to bleed. She kisses the wound. Ali comes over, upset. No, just fists I think. We bash each other's faces and whoever's still standing at the end wins. Hey, you're strangling me! He puts her down on her chair. Yeah. Of what? I don't know. About 500, 1000 maybe. Um, yeah. Risk my health? What are you talking about? Why are you getting so worked up? You can give it to me if you have too much money, but I said I was doing it and I am. That's all. I didn't say it's not for the money! Oh, stop driving me crazy! I'm doing it to fight. For fun. Why did you clown around on your fish? For the fun of it, right? She grins. Spare me. You turn on the waterworks when you feel like it. Mm? Who's she? His girlfriend. Surprised, Stephanie looks at Ali, watching for his reaction. He looks elsewhere. The gate opens. Martial drives in. (under his breath) Motherfucker's acting like he's on Canal Plus. I don't know. Guys with money. Dealers. A beat. Great. Martial comes back with a wad of banknotes and slides into the passenger seat. It's okay. Let's go. Fall against the big one in black shorts. I told you. They're big guys. Okay. And the bets? How much is there? A little over 2000 for the time being. But it'll go up during the final match. No girls. Stay in the car. (To Ali) You ready? Ali nods. You and you. Ali pulls off his T-shirt, staring down his adversary. Martial takes the T shirt and leans over to Ali. If you get into trouble, don't insist, just fall. Ali doesn't flinch. The cousin, the bettors and the other fighters move away. I have to go. Another combat begins, while Ali jogs around the hangar. Stephanie watches other combats, whether featuring Ali or not. (driving) No. You liked it. Me too. He again lowers his head. Pull over here. I'll go rinse off my face. (puts out his hand) Give me 50. Martial uses his turn signal. Have you known him for long? What? No, since you know him, I just wanted to know if you've seen him like that before? He freaks me out. He takes his share and hands Stephanie the envelope. 1200 for him. She looks at the envelope without taking it. It's for Ali. Hey, you make it complicated. Either you take it or you don't. And either I talk or I keep my mouth shut. He tosses the envelope at her. She looks away. Ali finally gets back into the car with a big box. It's a toy: a green John Deere tractor with all the accessories. For my kid. Yep. Cut the shit. He's not dead. I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry about it. Anna avoids his glance. He rummages in his pocket, pulls out the envelope of money and hands it to her. Here. Money. What I owe you plus the next few I won a fight. Hey, will you take the money or not? Why are you looking at me that way? (pointing to the tractor) You like it? Sam continues to play, ignoring him. Behind them, Richard is folding up parasols with the help of Che, a bearded neighbor who is also there with all his family. Have you eaten? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. (to Sam) You want to go for a swim? Give me a kiss. I don't want to. Give Daddy a kiss! No. (using a deep voice) Give Daddy a kiss! (deep voice too)... No! Ali kisses him and hugs him tight. Hey! I'm here. They told me 429. Martial motions him in. Normal. This one is for the equipment. Boxes of equipment are piled up under the window and the small table has been converted into a work surface. A camera is plugged into the TV set. It shows a still picture: an empty location, one sector of an industrial site filmed from above. I have to watch this. Have a seat. You wanted to see me. Ali sits on the edge of the bed. Martial watches the screen out of the corner of his eye. I need to find a coach. A real one. Someone who has me work on my takedowns. Foued? Foued doesn't know jackshit. Just jiu-jitsu and rap stuff. You need to ask Cousin. His guys must train somewhere. Think so? Yeah. And I'll need some time to train. I'll talk with Alta Secu. We'll be able to work something out. Work it out how? I'll have my company pay you and I'll bill them what you cost me. They'll keep paying you but now you'll work directly for me. You won't have to spend your nights there. There is some movement on the screen. He interrupts himself. Gray silhouettes cross the screen, open a door and disappear before coming back to cross the screen once again. Where's that? At the Mousquetaires. Martial rewinds and zooms in on some faces. I'll make a copy and you'll take it to the Look who it is! Go on, honk! We're going to school. Want to come along? Ali shakes his head and continues jogging. The truck disappears. Where are you? I can't see you. Where? He looks every which way until he sees her, a few feet away. She is standing upright, in a light pair of pants, with her canes hidden behind her back. It takes some time to register. She smiles at him. That's fucking amazing! I was looking for a wheelchair... Since when? You could have told me! No, I don't know. You're like before. Go on, let's see. She takes a few steps forward, leaning on her canes. He whistles in admiration. It must be like walking on stilts... You look taller. Does it hurt? Want to go for a swim? She stops. Is this all you have? You don't have any pate? I'm hungry. He begins with the cheese. No bread? Yes, but they're not girlfriends. Yeah. She hesitates. No, I don't care. (pause) How about you? Did you have a lot of boyfriends? Yeah. That's all? And now? You don't want to? How do you go about it? You want to fuck? She is thrown for a loop. You want to know if it still works, so let's fuck and that way you'll know. He looks at her, simply, naturally. She has a nervous laugh. Um, yeah. Give me that. He takes the plates, gets up and puts them in the dishwasher. Whatever you want... You tell me... She hesitates. What do I do? Okay? Ready? Unsure of herself, she pulls a face. No. Your breasts... can I? Maybe you should stop talking now... Are you okay? How was it? She blushes. Is it still working? Yeah but I don't have time right now. I have to go! But did you enjoy it or not? When you're up for it and you can't find anyone, ask me. If I'm oper, we'll do it. Operational... If I'm available. If I can, I mean! Yeah. She sketches a vague gesture. What? Her throat is constricted, she is unable to answer. Shit! I was talking? I'm with a friend. She's a friend, I said. Just then, the basement door opens and Stephanie appears on her crutches. Anna is dismayed. Ali motions to Stephanie: (to Stephanie) Let me introduce you to my sister! (to Anna) This is Stephanie. You know the girl from Marineland. Stephanie offers her hand to Anna who takes it, then realizing what she's doing, puts the other to her mouth: You don't want to get going? You freak her out. Can't you see? She feels like a cashier with you. Pathetic with her tea and cookies. It's a pain. Stephanie leans on a cane to stand up. What are you doing? No need to overdo it. Does it hurt? Stephanie smiles at him. You okay? He puts a wad of money in the glove compartment. You ready? Ali nods ‘yes'. He opens his door, gets half out and empties the bottle of water over his head. Stephanie is left alone in the car. She hears the spectators' cheers. She closes the window and turns on the air conditioning full blast. ... All of a sudden, in your mouth, it's like it tasted like bone. A taste of rust and bone. Yeah, there I did. Then, through the spectators' legs, he sees something: sunlight reflected off the Mercedes door that has just opened on a pair of shoes attached to two prostheses, a pair of shorts… He also sees the heads of the tough guys who turn back to look. He breaks free, struggles to his feet, spits up a clot of blood and returns to the task at hand. His opponent tries to get up. Ali jumps on him to finish (to Ali, pointing to the manager) Go get the equipment. I need to see him. Ali obeys. Don't bother. We're the ones who will call the police. The police and the press. That way they'll know you spy on your workers! The manager looks away, accompanied by his two guards. At least have the courage to look at me when I talk to you! (suspicious) Packing up. No. He notices that she's taken out her cell phone to take a picture. Don't you take a picture! I said no picture! I'm going to slap you! A hand grabs his arm. It's Martial. Forget it. Let's get out of here! And the equipment? Forget about it. We're fucked here. The cops are going to question the managers and the managers will turn us in. They leave. In here. Stephanie looks back, surprised. Martial motions her in. I have to go away for work. 3 or 4 months, I don't know yet... Since Ali wants to keep fighting, I thought maybe you tend to that while I'm not here... She is thunderstruck. He's the one who asked me to call you. I guess he trusts you. I wrote it all down here. As for the rest, ask me your questions and I'll answer them. You can count on your fingers, can't you? Yeah. A beat. And you need money to cover the bets, and you have money. She looks at him. What? You're not rich? What did the insurance company give you for your legs? 200,000? 300,000? Those jobs must have good health plans. Am I wrong? Grenoble, then Vienne. No, in the Isère. Yes. A beat. He gives her time to wrap her head around that one. Then, since she still looks troubled, he taps her on the hand. It's me, I said. Don't worry. I'm the bad guy. The Cousin's waiting for you inside. Table to the left of the bar. Ali knows and greets everyone. Stephanie is in the middle of the group. She holds herself up on the shoulders of these big, caring guys and lets herself be carried along. She feels good Want to boogie? She doesn't understand. (loud) You want to dance? Come on! Whatever you say. He goes to the dance floor and begins to rock. He dances badly, clumsily. Martial pours champagne. Can I talk to you? She nods "yes". There's something I'd like to know... The fish that ate your legs... She wasn't expecting that. Is it true it's still there? They didn't shoot it? Or put it down, whatever? I don't know... when a dog attacks you, they kill it. And the fish gets off. Don't you mind that the thing that ate your legs is living it up in its shitty fucking aquarium? (imitating her) "Now more than ever". Listen to you! He takes another drag. (imitating her) Tututu-tu-tutu... They laugh. Tututu... (loud) No problem. What are you drinking? What's your name? I'm Pierre. Come here often? Stephanie is on automatic pilot. When she turns to the room, she feels the blond guy's eyes locked onto her. She can pretty much tell what he's thinking about the breasts under her T-shirt. She answers his questions, she returns his smiles. When she finishes her glass and puts it down on the counter, he kisses her. She doesn't push him away immediately, like a frightened virgin, she takes the time to put a good face on it. Okay, no problem... Sorry. I couldn't know. Stephanie freezes. Huh? You okay? Did you stay late? Normal. (to the waiter) A large coffee with milk and bread with butter! A beat. What conversation? What do you want me to say? Oh la! Nothing. You're pissing me off. What's your problem? How am I looking at you? The waiter arrives with Ali's order. She tones her voice down a notch. What are you talking about, fucking or fighting? Manners? I'm oper now. You made me oper. It's you! It's because it's all you're talking about! I'm getting out of here. I'm fed up. Yeah. Yeah. Aren't you being an ass by putting words everywhere? He sits back down. She watches him eat his sandwiches. He saw me at la Ciotat. We spoke a few times on the phone. When he has it in for you, he never lets up. Leonardini is well-known. So are you going to Strasbourg? What do you think? I'd be an idiot... And when are you leaving? Leonardini enters the locker room. Mr. Leonardini, this is my buddy Ali. Ali Van Versh. Leonardini shakes his hand. Pleased to meet you. How much is there? Where are you? What are you doing? Is it early? Shit, I collapsed... Ali slips out of bed, naked, yawning and groggy. He comes and leans over her... Hold on. She hangs onto his neck. He lifts her up and, both naked, he carries her into the bathroom. Yeah. And when do I see him? Huh? Mm. No. They look at each other. He puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her. Stephanie slides over to him. He lifts her up and places her on her stomach. They remain like that, without moving. She looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock. She leans over and kisses him on the mouth. He pulls away, surprised. Now we're allowed? No answer. They make love. In CU: the tattoo on Stephanie's left thigh. A red and black arrow with, in industrial characters: "LEFT". You okay? No answer. You don't seem it. He goes to open the fridge. I'm hungry. What the hell is going on? Shit... But what's the problem if I eat here? Anna stands up. I couldn't know... Calm down. Calm down, I said! Ali looks back. He sees Richard's grim face at the other end of a hunting rifle. Take your stuff and get out of here. We don't want to see you around here anymore. 1,2... 1,2,3,4... Faster! 1,2,3. Yes. Faster! Move! You're stepping back! Ali pounds harder and harder. He times his respiration to match the movement of his fists. I can't come in any further or I won't be able to get back out! Ali checks out the huge semi. Looks like you changed trucks! Bosses, in fact. I'm back to being exploited. Ali doesn't insist. Richard opens his door to let out Sam who is already trampling him, trying to get out. (to Sam) Got everything? Your bag, your coat, your hat, your mittens? You haven't forgotten anything? Now give me a kiss. Sam gives him a kiss. Richard slips him out and into Ali's arms. How are things there? They're okay. My sister? She found a job at a school cafeteria. She seems to enjoy it. Does she know about today? Yes. She says it's good for the kid. Tell her I can't help out for the time being but that as soon as I have a little money... Don't worry. When's your fight? Next month. On the 9th. Richard smiles admiringly. Keep us posted if you win. Sure I will. Yeah, right... Okay, I'm off. I'll deliver my load in Colmar and pick up the kid at around 7, okay? Okay. No later, because I have to be back tomorrow at 11. The two men say good-bye. Sam waves good-bye. I want to skate too! They're not skating. They're skiing. No, they're skating. They're skiing, I said! Skating. A few steps on: Skiing. You're annoying me. They take a break at a picnic area, where they eat some sandwiches and drink orange soda. (his mouth full) Does Auntie still have dogs? No, now it's chickens. In the garden? Yeah, in the cage. They lay eggs. That's good. But Auntie doesn't want me to take the chicks in my room. She's right. They're disgusting. (pointing to his sandwich) Finished? You want some You can go. But not too far! Sam starts slipping and sliding. He falls down. He lies on the sled and lets it glide. Ali pees behind a tree. Sam is far away. Come on, we have to head back! 5 minutes. Now! (showing his fingers) 5 minutes! 5 minutes. And then suddenly, instead of gliding, the child sinks. He tries to climb out and sinks again. A thin layer of ice is forming over him. Daddy! Daddy! Shit! Ali rushes to the pond, but Sam is already iced over. He kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole. Sam has disappeared. Ali shoves aside snow. He looks everywhere, but sees nothing. And then he hears a noise, blows like signals coming from under the ice. Ali crawls Here. She wants to talk to you. Anna? Richard shakes his head. Hello? No. Okay. He woke up an hour ago. No, I don't think so. I fucked up my hands on the ice. They're broken. A beat. How are you? What are you up to? I wanted to say that... Don't hang up. Don't hang up! He was in a coma for 3 hours... Three hours... For three hours he was dead... I was scared to lose him. His eyes well with tears. Don't leave me. I love you. Wake up, kiddo. It's over. We're going home. Did you win? He smiles and kisses his biceps.
