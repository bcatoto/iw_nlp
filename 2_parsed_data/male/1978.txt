Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are? And then you... Playing? Ah yes. Of course... So few survive. La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release? Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve. But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do. Where did you play? You seem... disturbed.Yeah.

Oh, Jesus. But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother! Why?... What do you mean?... Why??? Sal's alive??? Talked to Sal? Sal's alive? No? No. How's Angela? How's she taking it? Rough. We didn't have to do it, John. Fine. Hey, I'm fine. Biederman! Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.

I mean, how does this job work out? Naw, it's... This guy wants his money. Naw, it's... I mean... Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt? Frost. How's the trailer? It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it. That was nothing. That wasn't anything. Fine. I'm fine. How are you? No. Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life. What kind of beer would you like? Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer. Would you like a beer? I don't know what we've been waiting for! Would you? Will you marry me? Linda, Linda...! Linda... Hey, Linda... Sure. Are you kidding? Sure. Linda, what's the matter? Linda... Nick. We... Three bullets. Playing. Up north. I... No. You do this for money? Merle... Hey, Merle, listen... Why? Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing? I did. I... This is stolen. I came back. Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you? YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!! No. No way! No way. No fucking way! How many bullets? With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!! More bullets in the gun? We what? Merle... Forget Sal? What do you mean? Okay, okay! Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal? You're right... Okay, you're right. What do you think? I'm doing that too. What else? They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now! What are you, God? Hunt with Vince? Huh? It's ahead, Vince. You got it. Merle -- From Nam? Well, where's he from? Is he from here? Pow. Pow. From Nam? You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac! Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo? I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too. Yeah... I guess. I don't think about the shot that much. The shot? Yeah. Yeah. So do I. Huh? Yeah. I know. Won't we? Right? Am I right? Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell! Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange... Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story? Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary? It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary. Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in. We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip? Yeah. I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind. It's Merle, Sal. It's not socks, Sal. Here. Behind you. I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here? No. Yeah. I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars. Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it! We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart. Sal, we need you. We need you. Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly -- What? John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out? Great. Hey. That's great. What's that noise? What's that noise? Oh. You know. How's it with you? Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick. See you Monday. Great. That's great. Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book. Don't worry what it says in the book. As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched. Where's Vince? I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find. The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that! You loaded it, Vince! I saw you! In the timeless words of Squire Albert... Sure. Yeah. They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths. One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun. Never one. No. Naw. Uh-huh. Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A! What the hell's that for? Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great! Cynthia! Sure. Well, who'd you get married to? How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been? It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home? Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home? Merle? Merle, I wanna go home! This is horrible! I want to go home, Merle. No. No, no. Who the hell is he? Yeah! No. Phantom Mary? Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be -- But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this? Merle gave me this? Merle? ... Merle's alive? How do you know? Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now. Where? You didn't get a deer? Did you get one? Did you go hunting. Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home. Hey, Nick. How can you need me? I gotta get back, Nick. Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean -- I'm gonna stay here, Nick. Listen, Nick -- John Wayne... Listen, Nick -- What? Same. Hey. Same old stuff. Nick. Hey. How's things? See you Monday. That's my plan. I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down. Right. You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts. Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight? There's Albert! Hey, Albert!!!Up a little there... What would you say? Down. Up ribbon! Up I would say... What would you say?Up. Down ribbon! Down I would say... What would you say? Up.She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!! In case!!! The gun's in case!!! She does not! I do!!! I know! I fuckin' know! Who? Who is? Let's go!!! Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught! Well... you remember Cynthia? What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe! Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think? Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right? Nick...? Jesus, Nick! What the --! It's gotta! It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert? So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts! They did too! I'm telling you, they changed it! Who's full of shit? This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it. It is too! Now you passed it! I'll get it! Where is it? And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need-- What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this? Where's it gone? 'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were -- Hey, Nick... Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!! Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks? Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em! Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now. Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass! Hey, guys... You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle! I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it??? You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard! Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle! What do you mean, no??? No!!!? Then lemme have 'em. Here! This is it! Here, here! This is it! I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit! Bullshit! That's bullshit! Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words. The fuck I did!!! What the hell was that! What did you think? Did you think it was loaded! Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right? And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say? You're full of shit! Six or eight. And they go wild? Oh, Jesus! You're kiddin'! No! Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants? I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean -- How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back? What's it for?? That's who. Aw, it's a long story! Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat. He's getting married... and we're nuts!I thought you were gonna get one for me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just answer the damn phone. I can't help it. It just keeps ringing. I wonder where they went. ...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it. Okay. First I rip your clothes off...Yeah. Yeah, sure. I gotta go. We're all alone, aren't we? Are you sure?Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block. I found the car! He's here! They could be. I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it. Exactly what do you need? You have the wrong feeling. Sure... Jesus! If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes. He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him. I am. I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil. I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor. He isn't a man. Could have... They may be right. Anybody live here? I'll be here. It's important. I'd like to talk to you, if I could. Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis. He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons. I'm wasting time. You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going. I notified everybody! Nobody listened. You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old! Of course not. He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone." He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower. Move it! Pull up to the entrance! You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years. I couldn't if I tried. It means... I see. I see. Ever done anything like this before? If you say so. Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it. The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right. That's the idea. Here we are. Thorazin. ...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.Well, go tell her it's me, okay? Will you get her for me? Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?Laurie, you come with us... But you can't kill the bogyman. How? Are you sure? Was it the bogyman? It's the bogyman, isn't it? I'm scared... What is it, Laurie? Who is it? I saw him... Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now? Promise? Right. The bogyman! There WAS. I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside. No... Richie said he was coming after me tonight. What about the bogyman? What about the rest of my comic books? What about the Jack-O-Lantern? Laurie... Laurie, what's the Boogey Man? Mom doesn't like me to have them. Not any more. I don't like that story. I gotta go. I'll see you tonight. Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once. Uh-uh. That's a spook house. Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn? Can we watch the monster movies? Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns? Are you coming over tonight? Hey, Laurie...Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive. PROBABLY going. There's nothing else I can do. He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified... I've given them his profile. I'm not responsible, Sam.Sure you do -- you win either way. But of course. Soon, dark eyes, soon. So's mine. How fast is enough? With butter, if they got any.... What the hell. For you.... Well, I don't know.... You can? With the right wind, 15-20 knots. Get on the rocks! Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us! Don't! Bring her to port a little. That's it -- steady. Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean. What'd you do? Memorize the tide tables? Someone pop your balloon? Putz -- that won't be for hours. It's not going to be easy. Your dad must be really pissed. Turkeys! Eat wind! Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you. I could give you a dozen good reasons. Then why are we futzing around the dock? We can make a few bucks working at the beach. If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice? Maybe by now they are. Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love. Good. It's terrible. Is she responsible for the punch? We're hung up on something. Why'd they decide to move? No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic. Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky. Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson. Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean. What the hell. Did your mom put all this together? They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups. The Shark. Shit. Shit, shit, shit! We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear? Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me? Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse. I don't know. Sean! Catch it! There's a shark.... You're betting what you already got. Like hell! We're on the starboard tack! We're carrying weight.Can you get us a line? The rope! The rope! Over here! Anyone got another set of sails? You coming up on him? Want to talk about it? I thought you said she was going with us? Gangway, Turkies!I need a hand here.... What is it? What's there? It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey --- Tina! Oh, yeah. Sure. Got it. Never mind that shit. Just point. I'm going out there. Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there. Untie that rope. Mike's out there. You can't stop me. How long ago? Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone. Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay? The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it? Not the drugstore! You got it. Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it.... That one -- from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside it? What about that camera? The woman passenger on the boat that blew up. You didn't miss much. Christ, what a mess. In here. Could you just keep that crowd back, please? If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel. Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that. I just made it up. It means, "Get me out of there." What the hell's that? Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908. Then check it out. I'll be in the office. On your own time? Aren't you off-duty? Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here. What? Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others? At least you're safe. What about the others? It's okay. What happened? Mike? Is that you? No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. You can work until school starts. Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats. I got something for you to do tomorrow. You want to come here a minute? Michael. Not till next year. You stay right here. You're going in with me. You heard me. You stay here a minute. Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh? We've had a lot of trouble. Look, humor the old man -- just be careful. Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day? What about tennis? Riding? fixing up old cars? Bartending? You'll have to make up your own mind about that. You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school. Every day? Sailing? Where to? Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around. What else you got? Did you get any pictures? You said something about a camera. It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again. Ever! Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way. Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary. There is nothing to discuss. My ass! You're damn right that's what it is. What are you all, blind? It's a shark. Look -- teeth, jaw, gills. Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along. Temporarily? Uh...sure.... Too late, it's written. Sorry, I'm all booked up... Come, m'dear. All of us thank you, okay? Me neither. Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy.... Can't you tell? So there's one around here. Sound? That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around.... Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did this. Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish.... Is there one in these waters? That's it. I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan.... Look, I know a little bit about sharks. But that's what we're here to find out, right? The shark that did this. It was a shark, wasn't it? The Shark's mouth. Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth? Come on, let's check the bite radius. Look at that: As soon as I heard about it, I called you. This thing is big! His arms indicate big. Mike's out there. Going out. Just one minute.... Don't rush into it -- we may need the income. Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss. I try. Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm.... Fired me! I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw.... ...Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass.... Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me.... No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous. Then that's what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that. What'd I say? Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all. That's great too. Gorgeous. That's great. Yeah. I think so. Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake! The goddamn smell is always the same. In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. Call the cops. What are we, immune? I know what you're going to say. He wanted a job, he's got one. I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night. No. Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal. That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff? Nothing. Oww! Santos' place. Oh, hi -- How was dinner? Damn. For me? Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating? Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat He's another one. In the den. What're you guys doing today? It's good with coffee. Better yet. Need a ride? Mrs. Silvera? Good. Sean's awake. Mmmm. Home it is. Right. Listen -- what are you doing later? I did, I did. Remember 1959, the Jersey shore? Because they're playing our song. Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man? Do I have to talk to those two? Late. Go ahead, whatever it's worth. What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand? I've seen this sonofabitch before! What? Perfect. Look at this --- Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you. Proof! Someone has to do something. Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it! Maybe they are! Two of them are still missing! Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers.... It's still a good idea. I know, I know.... We have to do something. I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you? Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator.... Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one. We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone. Very impressive ceremony. Good speech. When? Did you say Cable Junction? Yeah? Then what? Did he raise the Kids? Where the hell is Air One? Harbor Air, do you read? Over? If they're not at the light, look for them. I don't want them out there. Get them back to port! That's it. Just do it, all right? There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port. Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse. Right now. Affirmative. Can you get your chopper airborne? Sure they did.... I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay.... Hang on! Hiya yourself. You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay? Some people. No. Find your brother, okay? Shouldn't he be at home?Swim for it! Back down! Stop paddling! I think we're changing course a little. It's okay, it's okay.... I can't help it it sticks in my mind. Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m. No problem, no problem. Oh, shit. That's what I want -- a gaff rig. None at all. I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night. I know. Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest. Tina Wilcox. Me neither. Get a dance yet? Sideways - For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way.... The wind drift is lateral. I can't stop thinking! By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out. More, with this wind. They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy. 3:30.You got it. Anything. Anything. Mmmmmm. But first, a little juice.... I dunno. We'll think of something. They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started. The tide's running. It'll take us to the light. Just like this. Give me back my hat! Come on back up here! Next week. Huh?See where Cable Junction is? Look to the left. The lighthouse. That's it. About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast.... Hey -- you can't do that. You're too close. Back off. Please. It's my job. But I signed for the boat. You' re not authorized any more. I can't let you take her out. About an hour, maybe two. Let's see -- I came on about eight.... Right. Nine-thirty, ten maybe. Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me. I know just where to go. If there is, develop it! What camera? Oh. Positive I.D.? I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here. Chief? We got a helluva tide this month. If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation. Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode Island. Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser. I never heard of a 908. Chief.... Happy to do it. Till noon. This is on my own time. Hi, Shorty. Good morning! Anything? What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right? Which way are we going? Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go. Neither of you can go. Yep. Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse. All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang. Right after, the Kids went out? Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island. Oh, great. What is it? What the hell is it? Until we find something. Happens every season -- someone takes off. Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting. Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.What the hell, we're steering for it. Throw it. As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in. My dad's the mayor.... Loser sails home alone. Coming up! Give way! We'll take your supercargo. We're hung up here. Snagged. Sean! Catch the rope! Hey! How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...? You bet. Hang on.... Want to swim home? Let's just go sailing, okay? Coming up! What's that mean? Shut up. Maybe it's gone. Anyone know what time it is?I was counting on hours. We better go back in. Yee-hah! Shut up. Why not? Yeah. They're moving pretty fast. I hope that's the cousin. No. Yeah, it's her job. Dad, I'm sorry.... Sean's still out there. I passed out, but I'm okay. Pop. I'm sorry. Hey, come on.... I kind of had plans.... Yeah? Is Hooper coming to dinner? Pop.... Oh, c'mon. Okay, okay. I'll be careful. I'll see y'later. Because. Bartending? I'm 17. I'm going. Do I have to? What else is there to do? I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing. No place special. Just hanging out. Maybe. Great. I will, I will. Waiting for Andy. Great. I'm not crazy about blind dates. How old is your cousin? We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide. I don't care. Name it. I can go out if I want to. No. That's not it. My dad told me not to go. Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach.... I'm not sure I can. I'll be right there. Wait up. Too hot tor those two? I can't believe it. It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know.... Would you take him? Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home. Okay, okay. Close your door. Quiet! Shhh! No. Maybe. Yeah. Eat Cheerios. Yeah. Go on, beat it. How was dive class? I don't need you. Andy's here.He's got to help or it won't work. Might as well. Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in.... If we beat them, they can both go home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat! Coming about....1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out. That's what he said. Then nothing. If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself. Last transmission said ten juve- niles. That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction. Brody? This is Patrol Base. Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port. I heard you. Patrol out. 10-4, soon as I can raise him. That's it? What for? 10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.What's that supposed to mean? You don't make enough. Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him? You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us? That could ruin us. What have you seen before? This is nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Some- thing in the lens. Is that what it is? It came up during the meeting. Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence? Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer. Don't you have any pull with the chief, here? Wait a minute.... May I have this dance? Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town. Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd do without her. Forget it, he won't listen. So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple. Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else. You should've been out there. You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac. There were shots fired! What the hell is he doing? How the hell do we get him down. from there? Oh, shit. I think we got a couple of live ones. And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.Okay, okay -- stand over there.... Let's see -- you got a minute? Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion, though.... Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing. You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up. Here's a test I did.... Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he.... I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped. I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days. Believe me, it's a pleasure....They're turning around. Anyone want to go the lighthouse? You going with Patrick? When are we going out? You and me?Now you're talking. Let's get out of here before we do find something. It comes here from Cable Junction. Power line. About damn time. I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry. And cold. And most of all, bored. How much longer? Figure they split?They made me go with them. Dad! Dad! Hi Dad. Can I go with you today? What's daddy doing? Can I go swimming? Mom, Michael won't talk to me. Yeah. I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in the way? Michael.... I want to go with you! Take me. You're going sailing. You're going out. You eat Cheerios. I want Fruit Loops. I want Fruit Loops! Do I have to play with the little kids? You always go with Andy.Help! Help! Hang on, hang on...Okay, go. Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play with the dolphins without skis.... Great! Did you ever see a dolphin?Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner. No class. That's a crock of shit. You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend. Who'd you ask? Nope.Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something? Martin, it could be anything. Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer. Martin, this is kind of an official meeting Don't push it this time. If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that. What am I, an ass? When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything. Bullshit. There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims? A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident. Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke. And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all lost on that one. We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know. Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money. No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing. Be realistic. Are you serious? We're alone. I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going. Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don't you? Hello, hello. It went well, I thought. Be reasonable, please.... Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over. We have to deal with the consequences. So? So? He thought he had a good reason. Oh, my God.... Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus. Wave to my son. Brody's riding his tower. Len, can I see you a minute?Who? They went out over there: must be some kind of exit. Anybody bitten? How's your hernia? You want to split your hernia again? Listen! It's there! KNOCK IT OFF! We go through the wall? Tunnel? Years? Twenty months? The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States. Two kilos. Yeah. The kids? Why are they... ...He had a bald skull and... Looks like a cheap hotel. Getchmis...? DAD! I know. For the money... ) How do you like it? Istanbul? Where you staying, Dad? Nothing. Just twisted my ankle. Dad... I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise. No, don't let her! I'll... How about Peg? Robbie? Yeah. How's Mom? Dad...I'm... Okay! Ley me out right here. I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you. I'll walk it. Where are the minefields? I'll pay extra Not far. Just a little way. Those mountains? are they? Sixty? About ten kilometers. Sure. Yes. I think so. A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar. Yes...? No, I'm not afraid. Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one. She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to. ...She was on the plane. He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life. Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island. I was just going to sell it to friends. I'm not a pusher, honest. Three, four thousand...I don't know. The guy offered me the hash-- ...it just seemed like easy money. Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred. ...are you with the Consulate? I just needed some extra money. I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and... But just... But didn't have heroin. Stupid. How long? He wasn't even in the car? That doesn't seem so bad. It's not fair! How much did you have? What they give you? And you? What did he do? Yeah. That guy who beat me? I feel stoned. I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be. About as good as it looks. What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT! And? What do you mean? What's wrong? Thank you. Hello. Why the suit? Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again. Just got some news on Bell. Max - where? Yeah? Where? What? ...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched? If we knew where he hid it. Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways. We couldn't hide it anywhere. It's already been cut. Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody. Whose? What? Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire... After we're outside the kogus? Then we're outside the kogus. Then what? Yeah. We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace. Now let's go. Doubletime! We go back. Shit! Shit! Shit! What time is it? Jimmy? Okay? You got your stuff? Where is it? Section 13? But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy? What's that? What do you mean? Take it off! Take it off! ...S'il vous plait?... For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay! Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now. My passport! You're right. Never was anybody like you... Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again. You go on through, I'll catch up. I think I've been poisoned. I don't hear you bitch about the money. Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay! That's a great philosophy. Learn what? Know what? Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing! But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea. You rip us off on the hash. You're ayip! What is it with you man, what the hell is it? Did you ask for bail? What'd the Prosecutor say? If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece? Mr. Yesil.Billy! Please! We've been notified that they rejected the sentence... The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it. No... It looks like your going to have a new court. Sit down a moment, Billy. I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me. Hello, Billy.Good. Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him? Would you recognize him again? Good. Now, where did you get the hashish? Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?Ah, look! they probably know where the campers are All over. Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us. You sure you looking for your friends, man? How much? No! I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car. Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not? Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends? Sixty Lira? How far? You know where they are?Seven years... You just got to get yourself a good lawyer. And some money... Talk to Max. He's been in the longest. Aslan, there... But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself. There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months... A hundred grams. Twelve years. Hashish. Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish. New people sometimes get on his nerves. Feeling all right? Just Erich. How's it feel? Who got the Frenchman out? The lawyer? His name? Lawyers?Oh Jesus! I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid. Why'd you do it, Billy? Well, it's an interesting place... Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet. The Hilton. Where'd you get that limp? Don't worry about it. Right now money doesn't count. Okay? Right! That's what we're shooting for. Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here. Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe. Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted... Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy... Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but... ...Don't worry about it. I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here. You all right?Everything. Shit. And what do you do when you in the catacombs? Gotta be here someplace. Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there. Too bad you didn't have a machine. To what? Maybe he's changing jobs. Oh shit. What? His radio Back of his open, radio... Hishradyo. 'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it. I know where it is. You know where it is? Then I'll cut his balls off. I want to cut his throat. ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it. Cut his fucking throat. Oh we... we... What? Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me. That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him. When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight. I got some acid man. Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something. Goddamn Gastro's killing me. Making me blind. Hey Billy! What? You gotta be joking. It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up. Two thirty. Yeah! Yeah. I don' t know. It's someplace down in there.... ..deep.. A big door...a wheel.... Yeah, for the criminally insane. I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time... You gotta be fucking crazy! You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs. I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter. Get the... midnight... express. Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can... Oh Yesil... Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil... What lawyer? Who? Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...Let's hope so, Billy. Let's sure hope so. Lucky girl. Girlfriend? Be tough on 'em. What's your father do? Got a family back there? Beats working. How much did you figure to make? How much you pay this joker... this cab driver? Something like that. Cigarette? Just what? Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade. Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got... You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.Work, work, work, that's all do You 'Merican. You don't know. Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you. And you must fuck last. Was.. ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk. Buy. Sell. No family to take care. I learn. I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay? We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together. Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right? Cat, ah! Ayip!Me? Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it. The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target! Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but -- -- but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit! So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101 -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah! We kept many things underground. -- thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of -- It's very simple, Otis. Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then -- -- that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already -- But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already -- We're running out of smoke. Thank you. He's thirty-five years old. Nobody else. There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think. Bunkers! I know, but --What's she doing in California? Lois isn't here? It was hot, yes. I've been on the job. I will. North. It's north Mother... I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares. Mom... Don't worry, Mom. I know. No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise. You're not the only one. No thanks. Super...man. Hmmm... Is that what they're calling him? What'd you call him? Jealous? Of what? I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws. Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce. Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors. It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan. Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick. You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was. Come again? Can I take you to the airport? Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like. No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so. Don't you ever give up? Oh. Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and -- -- unless...would you be interested in dinner? Huh? I just took a shot at it. Know what? Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if -- It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois. He may have a gun! What the -- ! Unbelievable. But otherwise it's swell. I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board. Not really, no. Not really, no. Actually, she's silver-haired. No. I'll bet you have some good ideas. I'd like to.Will you abide by the Council's opinion? If you persist, you leave us no choice. This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final. You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection! But so is Vond-El You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El - Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic. She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess. You and Lois, you get all the action. There she is, out in the wild West and everything. A hot story, huh? You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you. On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it. How come you get all the good stories, Lois? Boy! Two. What're you writing, Lois?What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special. Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the - Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella. Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it. Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening? Folks'll ask question. He sure as heck does that. Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home. What's your name, boy?Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton. As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them? And if I don't obey? I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton. Then - My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately! But you can't ignore these facts! It's suicide! Worse than that, it's genocide. Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.' You've been doing some research in the archives. Well, physiologically, he... won't quite fit. Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong. He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable. Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them. They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals. Lara, please... It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as... And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us... Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for. Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El... Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system. ....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day - How good it felt! My son, I foresaw this. I knew - Enjoyed it?Not you. You. Tell me again. Got it? Otis? One of them should've been you. Albert! And stop interrupting. his is the big scene. Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part! Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too! Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot. It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and -- You're a great architect, Albert. That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo? Shut up, apple-polisher. Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium? Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs. I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world! You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces! Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know. Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band? Of course I can. I love you. What other one? I'm wearing it. Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick. Lex is going bye-bye. He always shows up when somebody's in danger. You got wax in your ears? Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea. Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood. Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy? Let's get high. Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it! Just look at that smog! Baby -- I'm going to take you higher. She knows. Clever, very clever. And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this. You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've -- -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know. Hit you? A clever girl like you? 'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever. I have to hand it to you. Something you can feed the pets, perhaps? Let's have it. No news is not good news. Y'know You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds. Don't let me down. Nothing. They stop for nothing. Ready? Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle. Weak sister. I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know? About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano. Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know? What do you suggest, my dear? The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table... La de da da... Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher. No, you're going to get kissed, Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock. Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose. Bingo! Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here? Stay and listen! Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed. See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know? Exactly, Miss Teschmacher. Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe. Y'know. Krypton! When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it. What's the temperature now? Damn! This will get him. Shut up. You're on. Nuts. He made it. He's from another world. I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town. Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack! First the pets, Otis. What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too? What's in it? You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know? Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above. Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers? A part of that will always be with me. I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time -- A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire. My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land." So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address. Me and my real estate? How many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this? Good enough for you. Now then -- -- tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it... Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him. Cleaning a rock, Otis? Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets. They're killing me by inches! Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry. Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake. Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your -- But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff! Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it. Something! Is that real enough for you? Otis... And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again. Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook? I gave him this new face. I gave him steady employment -- I broke the man out of prison -- Otis, were you up to your old tricks? What's the matter, Otis? Excellent, Otis. But what took you so long? Not there! A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section! Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for? No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared. What are you waiting for? Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast! For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong. But how could you know that - Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it. In a way -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot. There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero. Pancho's Taco Palace... Well, that's their problem, T.S. But -- but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many... You guessed it! You're always one step ahead of me. Aren't you Superman? Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out -- Zip! Zip! Zip! And garbage doors. Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button. I was doing my homework... I know. I know. I never promised myself a rose garden. You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well... ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101. Maybe I should get help. -- Dropped into the sea! Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast. And now...well... I left my heart in San Francisco... Couldn't have said it better myself. Now all this -- -- west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here -- -- is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well... ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point -- -- that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.' Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know... At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it. Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes -- It's just that -- I spent a fortune on these things! And all for naught! What a waste -- No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you. This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun. Oh, that. Listen -- you're busy -- and it's a long story -- Well -- you've got me! What can I say? Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?Sort of. I still don't get it. Oh, Mr. Luthor... Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it. It's a Twinkie, boss. You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock -- It is for me. Please... I guess I...uh...regressed. I...uh...check. I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor. I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor. Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter. Did I do good, Mr. Luthor? There. Yessir. Just what you wanted. I...uh...Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello. If one of you can get that -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up? I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English? Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent. Lois, the kickback story... Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around It does, huh? Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.Okay. Take me to your leader. Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that. Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city. I'd better get you down. The bald man! The one who tried to kill me? Besides that. What are you doing here? You! The girl from the volcano! Kryptonite... Listen...thank you. There are none of them any good anyway. Twenty-four. How good it felt - No! You couldn't imagine - I guess I got carried away I don't know what to say. Look, I -- I just - Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P... Very much. Sure. Pink. Only when somebody shoots them at me. Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone. Uh-huh. What about it? 195 pounds. Thirty-five. It's not bad. The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force. I wouldn't do that. It's against the law. I guess they are a little odd. You think they're strange? Ask, You're the girl reporter. I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke. Who's Clark? One of your colleagues? I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me. Unlisted number, Shall we proceed? There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help. I came to talk to you. Right on the first guess. Not a chance. It's too nice a night. Let's just say I'm a friend. And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay? I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings. Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon... Do as I say. Let go! Easy now, miss, I've got you??? We'll see how fast I can fly. Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing. They'll soon be over. Luthor -- On radio waves? The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button. It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it? Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have -- It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer -- a sick, twisted dreamer. Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have -- Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time. Of time, Luthor. I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor. Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember? But...why? What is this??!
