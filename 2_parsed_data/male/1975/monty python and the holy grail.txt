Bread? No, no, no. Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ... No, no, It floats. Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her. To the pond. Ah. Yes, of course ... um ... err ... I see. Yes, of course. Burn them. There are? Tell up. What are they, wise Sir Bedevere? Burn her anyway. A witch, a witch, burn her! She looks like one. Yes, she does.I'm not interested. Please! Well, it doesn't matter. Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here. Not at all. They could be carried. The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. What do you mean? Through ... We found them. So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea. ...What? Yes! I am... And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot.. I must speak with your lord and master. It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England! The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail? But the Grail ... where is the Grail!? And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there? Where does he live? Old man ... where does he live ... The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ... that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | | OLD WOMAN | Is Frank in? He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look, strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. You don't vote for kings. I am your king! What? Well, who is your lord? Please, please good people. I am in haste. What knight lives in that castle? All of us are ... we are all Britons. The Britons. How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle? What, "is"? How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is? What word? Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done! We shall do no such thing ... let us pass! What is that? Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery. May we go now? Yes ... Of course. Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni! You are fair and just. We will return with a shrubbery. All right! All right! ... No more, please. We will find you a shrubbery ... A what? All right! What do you want? Oh! Oh! Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers. We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ... Who are they? Come, Patsy. You're a looney. What are you going to do. bleed on me? You'll what ... ? I'll have your leg. Stop that. Look! You stupid bastard. You havn't got any arms left. You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine. What? Victory is mine. I thank thee O Lord that in thy ... You're a liar. Well, what's that then? A scratch? Your arm's off. Now stand aside worthy adversary. So be it! I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside. I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge. What? Well, what are you then? Well ... can we come up and have a look? Are you sure he's got one? What? Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest, and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail. I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table. Whose castle is this? Hello. Who are they? We shall attack at once. What? What? There! Look! Just keep me covered. Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot. No. No. No! That's it. Ni! Ni! | It's not working. You're not doing it properly. Ni! No. Ni! More like this. "Ni"! Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"! Who ... Who breaks out? Now what happens? This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere. Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes. Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table! What is your name? Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table? I am Arthur, King of the Britons. Who did we lose? Charge! Oh, shut up. Je...sus Christ! You got us all worked up. ... You silly sod. Behind the rabbit? Where? What? How shall we find this cave, O Tim? Look, you're a busy man ... A G...g...g... That is our quest. You know much that is hidden O Tim. You know my name? Greetings Tim the Enchanter! By what name are you known? What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder? Come on, patsy. Bloody peasant! Shut up! Shut up, will you. Shut up! Shut up! Be quiet! I order you to shut up. Be quiet! Yes, I see. Yes. Well ... I AM king. I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ... I didn't know you were called Dennis. :Well - I can't just say: "Hey, Man!' What? Man. I'm sorry. Old man, What knight live in that castle over there? Old woman! Good idea, O Lord! Yes, Lord. I'm averting my eyes, Lord. Sorry ...Wait. Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water? Does wood sink in water? So how can we tell if she is made of wood? And what do you burn, apart from witches? Tell me ... what do you do with witches? Quiet! Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch. Did you dress her up like this? Bring her forward. How do you know she is a witch? Oh, just some friends! Yes, my liege. Stand by for attack!! It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | | At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION. ARTHUR turns. | | ARTHUR | Who was that? | | HECTOR | | It was Sir Alf. | | ARTHUR | I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | | HECTOR | He was feeding it bread. | | ARTHUR | | Well, that was a very silly thing to do. Now the rest of you stand | well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | | HECTOR | Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | | ROBIN | Look out. | | The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them. The KNIGHTS retreat | into the darkness of the cave. | | GAWAIN | | It's only a cartoon. | | ARTHUR | Sh! It's the ... oh ... it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ... What does it say? What with? They're nervous, sire. Ni! Ni! Ni, ni, ni! Nu! No! Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"! Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ... leap out of the rabbit and ... Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed! OF course, my Liege ... And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped. Bedevere, my Liege. My liege, I am honored. My liege ... forgive me ... Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science? And therefore? Exactly. So... logically ... Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone? Why do you think she is a witch? The nose? Well?All right, we'll call it a draw. The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you! I'm invincible! Come Here. I'll do you for that. Had enough ... ? What! Just a flesh wound. Course I have. Had enough? Come on then. Come on you pansy! I've had worse. No, it isn't. 'Tis but a scratch. I move for no man. Then you shall die. None shall pass. None shall pass.I feel happy... I feel happy. I think I'll go for a walk. I feel fine. I'm getting better! I'm not dead!He hasn't got shit all over him. I dunno, Must be a king. That's all right. See you on Thursday. Thursday. I promised I'd be at the Robinson's. They've lost nine today. I can't. I can't take him. 'Ere. He says he's not dead. Ninepence. Bring out your dead!It just seems silly ... me lying here. Really, I feel fine, sir. I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir. I think I could pull through, sir. I'm not quite dead, sir ... Thank you, sir, most kind ...Oh, Did you hear that! What a give-away. Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed! Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system. I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away! You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! ... but a two-thirds majority ... ... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs. ... But all the decision of that officer ... I told you, We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune, we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week. Oh, very nice. King, eh! I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food. And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society! If there's EVER going to be any progress ... What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ... You didn't bother to find out, did you? Well you could say: "Dennis" :I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old. I'm thirty-seven. Man!Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains? Do you want to come and have a drink? 'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country.... Camelot? Are you from Camelot? You even kicked the bride in the chest! It's going to cost me a fortune! Didn't mean to? You put your sword right through his head! I can understand that. You killed eight wedding guests in all! They cost fifty pounds each! Did you kill all those guards? How? You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep! Shut up! You only killed the bride's father - that's all - Not you. Who are you? Shut your noise, you, and get that suit on! Don't like her? What's wrong with her? She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ... Herbert ... We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get. Listen, Alice ... You're not going to do a song while I'm here! Rather what? Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing. All I had when I started was swamp ... other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp. I built another one ... That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp .... So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island. Father, lad. No! Not the curtains, lad ... All that ... all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad. One day, lad, all this will be yours ... No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back. Where are you going? Is that clear? Yes ... make sure ... Make sure he doesn't leave. And make sure he doesn't leave. Right. No, not anyone else - just me. No ... just keep him in here. No .... keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ... Look, it's simple. Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room. Yes? Got it? Leaving the room. No ... You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave. No. Until I come and get him. Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.Oh, I see, Right. We're coming with you. Oh yes, of course! I thought you meant him! You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ... The Prince ... ? What? Okay. Fine. We'll remain here until you get back. Just you ... Until you, or anyone else ... Oh, yes! we'll keep him in here, obviously. But if he had to leave and we were with him. Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us? If we ... er ... Er ... if ... we ... er ... Leaving the room ... yes. We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room. ... and you'll come and get him. Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood. Make a bridge out of her. ... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart. And the hat. But she is a witch. ... Well, we did do the nose.No, It's nothing! Well ... Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ... Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste. Well, look er, I ... Er ... + You are the keepers of the Holy Grail? The Castle Anthrax? Ector. ... I Bet you're gay. Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril? Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can. Look, let me go back in there and face the peril? I don't think I was. No, really, I can cope. I can handle this lot easily! Look - I'm fine! Well, she's got a point. Why? Oh ... hello ... Camelot ... I'm sorry, I must go. No, no, this cannot be. I am sworn to chastity! There's nothing wrong with ... that. No look, really, this isn't nescess ... They're doctors?Course it's a good idea. Right. Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ... Well, don't. | I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms. they're so depressing. Now knock it of And don't apologize. Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?You're not fooling anyone you know. Isn't there anything you could do? Do me a favour. You're not. You'll be stone dead in a few minutes. He will be soon. He's very ill. Nothing... There's your ninepence. Why? Who's that then? Thanks very much. When's your next round? Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes. He won't be long. Don't be such a baby. Yes he is. Here's one!Blue. To find the Holy Grail. My name is Sir Launcelot. Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I am not afraid. Farewell, Concorde! I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre. Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile. Oh, well ... er brave Concorde! You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain! At last! A call! A cry of distress ... Concorde! Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain! And another! Well taken, Concorde! It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ... Oh ... that's awfully nice. Is it? I can explain ... I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note. Gosh - Is he all right? Oh dear, I didn't really mean to... Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.

That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.Am I right? Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second. right? It's not a question of where he grips it, It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ... A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut. What? A swallow carrying a coconut? Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? Well, this is a temperate zone. Found them? In Mercea. The coconut's tropical! Where did you get the coconuts? You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together. You're using coconuts! What? Ridden on a horse? Get away! Halt!

Stop saying the word! Don't say that word. When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring. When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha.

You must lie down. We are just not used to handsome knights ... But you are wounded! I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.
