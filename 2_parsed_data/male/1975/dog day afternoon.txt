You men shoot, aim for the white meat! Aw, hey... God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it. They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.' I was lookin' at it. I saw you, man! Jesus! You oughta see yourself! You wouldn't believe it. Jesus, you're the man! Yeah.Sonny? Don't send me away! I can help you save your soul ... That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny. You got to merge your whole soul with God. And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost. You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping? And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how? Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.You said a mouthful... sweetheart! Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh? Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage. It's my only chance! Yeah... yeah. Well... I don't know if I have or not. Yeah... huh, thank you. I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people. They're really trying to help me. Yeah... yeah! They won't talk to you. Yeah... I knew it. But, what choice do I have? I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here... Look... don't throw that on me. No! They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me. I don't have a choice. Yeah. Sonny, would you please just tell them... please... I can't survive in prison, Sonny... I gotta listen to it if they think... Well... they told me that I was an accomplice... These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing. They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank! Would you do something for me? Please? Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy! Oh... wow! Sonny, you're really into one mess now. So! Sal is with you? I like that... yeah! I don't know... you could have picked a better place. God, Algeria! Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God! People walk around with masks and things on their heads. They're a bunch of crazy people there. Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that? You're really warped! Why you going to Algeria? Where you gonna go? You're really crazy. You're crazy. I'm free to do what I want? And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane? Where? Where ya going? What trip? Well... But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank. I'm sorry... Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death? Don't talk about death to me. I have been living with death for the last six months. Why do you think I'm in the hospital? I take a handful of pills to get away from you. And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again. I have no friends left. No job. I can't live. I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry! No really... I don't think that you realize what it means. The things that you do, Sonny. You put a gun to somebody's head... What do you mean... what am I talking about? Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life? I am dying. Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you? What? What are you talking about? You are dying? Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that? Yeah... I know. Yeah. So how are you? You can't talk or do anything. You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now. You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy. And they start putting things in your arm... you know. How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time? Yeah. It was terrible. I'm really shakey. Ooohh.... I never thought I'd get out this way. I'll tell you. Well... I'm out of the hospital. Hello, Sonny. I don't know what to say to him. I can't. I'm afraid. I can't talk to him. It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages. And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation. So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital. Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!' So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me. Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with. I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body. So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that? 2500 dollars! My God, he's in hock up to his ears already. He's scared. It's crazy. I never met anyone like him. His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children. His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable. I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already! But he did it. I don't know why. I thought it would help me, but it didn't. I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things. He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person. What good is that? They couldn't stop him. And it'd just make him mad. They don't know him. He won't listen to anybody. He's been very crazy all summer. Since June he's been trying to kill me. I can't help it. I can't stop him from anything. Oh no! Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!I'll kiss the baby for you. Well, stay away from them. Don't get close. The robbers in the bank. They got guns? It looks like a whole roast. Jenny?Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you. What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help. Listen. What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people? So whatsa deal? I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out. No. I never smile any more. You think it over, Leon. How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone? You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory. You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case. Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there? He needed money? For the operation for you? What kind of things, Leon? He's makin' threats in there. Somebody's got to stop him, Leon. You try calling the police? If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to? He's got eight people in there with him. He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people. Well, you got to get hold of yourself. You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up. Leon? Whatsa matter? They give you a shot down the hospital or what? He's groggy, Sonny. Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. He's all doped up. We're bringing in your wife... Aspirins ... okay you got it. Charlie! Six pizzas! What else? There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need? How else can we help you? I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you? Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ... Can't land ... you'd kill people ... It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ... Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got. Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ... Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ... I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ... No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you. They were ... Sonny, come on out! I'll see what they'll do. The girl hostages. Okay, what do you give me? Sonny, be reasonable! I don't know, Sonny. I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out. I got superiors, unnerstan? They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can. It's okay, you got a lot of protection. Calm down, you're not ... What? Well, armed, then. Nobody's been hurt. Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year. Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got? Quit while you're ahead. All you got is attempted robbery. I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room. I want you to see this. Come on. I want you to see something. You're all one way! I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ... Okay, give us the women. How about letting the people out of the bank. Why put them in this position? I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny. I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me. Some sight ... right? You frisk me. Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there. I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me. So you can see you can trust me. So we can talk and find a way outta this mess. Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short? Sonny-boy, one word? Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you. Right -- got ya. Okay, so there's you -- what's your name? Sal? What's that for? Salvatore? How many you got in there? You alone, or you got confederates? Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay. Okay, you're in there and we're out here. What do we do now? Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there? This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls. You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you... What are you doin' in there? He hasn't so far. I'm the one who can make a mistake. That's what scares the shit out of me. What makes you think you'll be able to control it? Here comes the FBI. You men lookin' for protection? We got all the police right here.What now, Sonny? No. I had some legal training, but... Yeah? Why not? Would I hire you? We like you, too. I'm sorry. You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge. Sure - we like you. Special to me, too. They look like good kids. I'll be God damned if you will. I stay here. Damn it. I just needed the insulin. I'm used to it. Go on. Go on. I'm not going. I'm okay. I'm okay ... I'm okay ... Are we going to get the ball rolling? I don't know. I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess. What now, Sonny? I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language. They don't speak that way on television. It's a rule. Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication? The TV ... they want to talk to you ... I don't fool around with you. If you take anybody, please take me. I don't care who you are ... I just want to get you outta here, safe, right? I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again. They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning. I don't know what they learn, Sonny. Well, they go to guard school. Mulvaney... It's locked on the inside. It's through that passageway and to the right. I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero... Hello, Mulvaney here... For God's sake, will you please go now? We gave you every nickel we got. Give me the keys... Howard, give him the keys... Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name? Believe me, I'm on your side. It's all we got. Come on, lemme load you up... I must of been outta my mind. I can take care of that. Do what the gentleman says, Howard. Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup! It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.] Thanks again, Sam. Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out. Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all. Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket. What is it, Sam? You were terrific, too! Girls, I wanta apologize. For my language back there. I didn't eat any pizza. What about Howard? It's up to you ladies.Do you remember anything else about Sal? Did you always call him Junior. Did you know he was a homosexual? When was the last time you saw Sal? How did you know your son was involved?You gonna smoke the cigarette? You're really pure, you know? You got a perfect record. You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now? Your body is the temple of the Lord. Go ahead. Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record. You oughta take care of your body. You shouldn't start now. No! I'm not kidding. Don't you understand? You're pure! Because I don't want cancer. I used to, but I stopped. You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now. Hey, Sonny - You did it! I'm here. Okay, Sonny. Okay. Why couldn't he talk about that here? What'd he say? They gotta stop sayin' that. Have him walk in backwards. They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual. I want you to stop them saying that. Get over there! Everybody! Back here! I never been up in a plane before. Sonny - Wyoming. Does that still go? ... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made? You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right? What did we say? What did we say! What do you mean? You talkin' about coppin a plea? What kind of a deal? All right ... send them the guard. Dead or alive? I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it. But I want to know what you think. But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse... Are you serious? About throwin' a body outta here if we have to? But do you mean it? ... The bodies out the door. You mean that? How'd that happen? Goddamn women... Where's the money? He's gone? Let's go, Sonny. Fuck him - let him out!I'm glad it's okay. Okay. Yeah. Well, you're okay? You all right? Everything's all right? You okay?Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal. Why don't I take it over now? He's totally unstable. He'll make a mistake. We're all set at Kennedy. Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street? We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready? That's the jet. You give us one more, now. That's the deal... You follow my car. I can't allow that, Sonny... What can he do, he's clean... Sonny! Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please? What's wrong? What I said. You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal. I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here. I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to. I have to see. I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay. I want them all. Okay, when do I get them? I'd like to work with you on this, not against you. I've got a jet. I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour. I want the hostages. No more favors. That's all over, Sonny.You'll be okay. Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now. Okay. Yes, I would. Come on, what's under this? These seats come out? They're not after you, they're after me. Heidi - why didn't you come down here? Don't call yourself fat. Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?! Heidi, I'm dying. What about the kids? It's okay... it's okay... Take the subway. We need the car. Hey, gimme the keys - the keys! Hey, don't take the car! It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place... Jackie - what are you talking about? Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay? No. Look, we're kind of.... Yeah, well I don't blame him. Yeah... I'll write a song. Ha, ha. I don't know. Life is funny! Right. See you sometime. I don't know what to say to ya! I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever. Well, then... Do you still want the operation? That's good then. You've found something. All right! He didn't do it. All right? Now... would you get the fuck off the phone? I'll bet that really changed them, huh? Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you? Are they on the phone still? All right, enough! Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway? Is that you Moretti? You on the phone? Will somebody talk to me? Who's on the phone, now? What do you mean... throw it on you? You knew it, right? Look... who's on the phone? You don't have a choice? That's great. Just terrific. You talk to me with them on the phone, right? That is really smart. And, you don't tell me? Where are they now? Just tell me... are they on the phone now? All right. Then what do you want me to say? Shit... Oh... they're fucken crazy. That's a snow job. Don't listen to that shit! How did they think that? What are they... crazy? What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon. They're giving you a fucken story. What? He ain't going out. And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all. So, I can't do anything. I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how! One of the ways is not giving up. I'm telling ya! I know I am. I know! Sal? Yeah... Sal is with me. Sal wanted to go to Wyoming. I told him it wasn't a country. We gotta get outta the country! To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is. Okay. Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in? Denmark? Sweden? What am I supposed to do? I know that. I'm warped... I'm warped! Huh ... I don't know. They got Howard Johnson's there. I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for. Who the fuck knows? I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria. So, I don't know. So I'll go to Algeria. I know! That's it. I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing. And we're gonna go, man! I'm getting out of here, man. I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up. I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway. So fuck it! But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon. If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come. You're free to do what you want. I did it on my own. I did this all on my own. I ain't laying it on anybody. Nothing on anybody. I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know. I am squaring away my accounts with life. Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow. Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too! I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know? That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip... All right. I know you didn't ask me. You didn't ask me but I did it. I told you. That I got a lot of pressures. You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money! I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money. I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that. Well, I don't know what to say, Leon. When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit. I mean, what am I supposed to say? I don't know what I'm doing. Now don't give me that deep shit now. Don't start with that shit. What are you talking about? I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know. Boy... I'm dying. Fine, thank you. I'm in trouble. That is... now I am! So... that sure is something. Yeah... That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs. Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up. Oh... huh ... how you feeling? Well.... huh ... Yeah. You said... I thought you were never getting out? How are you doing? Hello. Hello, Leon. I want to talk to him. Is he all right? Is he all right? Yeah? Okay ... Cokes, seven-ups ... also some aspirin ... All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ... Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ... Don't fuck with me ... You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ... Well, what were you doin' back there? You're full of shit ... Yeah ... Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ... So, what were they doin'? You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there? You tryin' to fuck me? What the fuck do you want? What the hell you doin' back there? Nothin' doin'. I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet. What do you want? I want to see my wife. I want you to bring her down here. I want a helicopter to get outa here! And a jet to take us to... ... wherever we want to go. Outa the country, so no little jets. A big one with a bar and a piano lounge. He wanted to kill me! Calm down... look at this, look at him...! When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot. Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal? You're a city cop, where's the FBI? This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me! You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me. Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me! ... armed robbery ... You want me to give up, huh? Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them. Boom boom. How do I know you won't jump me? You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close. So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay. I'll see what I can do. Oh, no ... Women is all we got. They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot? Talk to me then. Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you. Right -- I'm with you, buddy. I frisk you? Call me whatever you want. One word. You won't find it in the phone book. Call me Sonny-boy. What do you want to know that for? Sal. He's the killer. We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand? I got Sal. I'm not alone. They're okay. I told you -- keep away. I don't know what we do now. ... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it? Okay? What a fuckin' comedy! WNEW plays all the hits. Who's this? Yeah. Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars! I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything! A clean slate, a new leaf... You got Bank Americard? I want to dictate my will. I need a notary? Are you a lawyer? Mister Mulvaney? I don't think so. Yeah. You know - I had a job once. I used to work in a bank. I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ... You know ... I like you people ... I really do. You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way. No you don't. You like me? They're like any others but they're special to me. You got kids? You told me; you got two. I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney. Oh, Jesus! You want to be a martyr or a hero or what? You tell me. Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out. Hey! I'm tryin' to help you. You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you. Come on ... ... let's get him out ... What are you talking about? What do you think I'm doin'? I'm gettin' the ball rollin'. I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean? I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ! I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun? You want to take it over? Do you think we can turn it on? Where's the air conditioning? Wait a minute ... I've been looking at this all wrong ... Let's look at it the other way ... You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you! Why the hell did he do that? What the hell did I do? What? You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean? They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they don't give a damn. In spite of that bank insurance. You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty. What if I take you with me? Don't ask me questions. I got connections. You find out who I am, you're cold meat. Ah, I know! You're being very cooperative. I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance? You got kids? To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun. Let's go to the back door. How'd that guy get to be a guard? You and me are checking the other ways in and out. Now, you -- what's your name? Where's the back door? I took too long. Sal, get 'em in the vault. You're goin' outside with me. If there's no cops around, we just split. Otherwise, you go with us. The gun's right on your back... Gimme the keys to get outta here! Gimme the traveler's checks and the register. My side, shit! Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites! Okay, don't worry about it. Stick it in the bag... This is it? What am I gonna do with this? Holy shit! What's the matter with you? Well, you get your mind right. I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me. Unnastand?!? Okay, is the vault open? Hey... let him out! If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him! Let's move it, goddamn it. Oh, Jesus! Hey. How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board. There it is, Sal. Sal? All right. Just give me a receipt. Hey, Sal, you okay? Hey, Sal ... How you doin'? He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal. What's wrong with him? He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV. Sal? It's the FBI. He wants to come in. That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them. I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want. Forget it. It don't matter. What? Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they're movin' ... I also ordered some food ... I got some pizzas for us, all right? I got some things to drink - I got sodas ... I even asked them for aspirins ... I'm doin' what I can ... now I gotta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills? Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay. I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay. They're trying to come through the door! It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car. Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ... Yeah ... Wyoming ... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States ... Look, I'll be back. You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends? If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go? Any country. Just name a country. We're not there yet. We'd kill ourselves. Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ... I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ... Okay, Sal ... what do we do? All right ... let's go.
