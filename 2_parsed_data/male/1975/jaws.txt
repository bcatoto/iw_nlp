Here -- Take him home. Just a favor for your old man. Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds. You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son? I want him out of the ocean. Son! -- Out of the water now! On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did? He's taken him! He's chasing us! I don't believe it. He's trying to sink us! Have you ever had one do this? What about us? Did you get him in the head? Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call. That's it! Radio in for help! Where...? What's that one, there? C'mon. Middle appendix -- Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour... Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow. What do we do? Get some help? Radio in? How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking? What's the point with hooks and Lines? -- The wire's showing! You got it? Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there? Who's driving the boat? You got it. It's my charter. My party. Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there... He's from the Oceanographic Institute. This is Matt Hooper... Two cases. And dinner when you land. You got it. You got it. You got it. I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000. What? Tell 'em I went fishin'! Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this. Colorful, isn't he? No. Home here. I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want. You want to come? Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not. You too, sweetheart... How come you have to tell them that? I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself... Michael! Come inside! Where is he? Love a cup of tea. With lemon. Ow. He's gotta be more careful in the water... Love ya. Here? You gotta be kiddin'. I don't want to depend on these things, y'know -� sometimes you can weaken your eyes. Sexy, hm? What was I before? Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh? I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers. Ship it. Feed the dogs. Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one! Give me 30 years, I'll get it. The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound? Probably out in the back yard. Right. How come the sun didn't used to shine in here? Just sign it, Larry. The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me. Right there. Whatever it costs. Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that? I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead. There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor. Got a pen on you? Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August. We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have. He lost it on the way up. I'm going home. She's right. Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way. Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute. Sure he is. Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him! I didn't agree to that! I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland. I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins. I was only reacting to what I was told. So we should set out a smorgasbord? Now tell me something I don't know. Do I need any more authority? Y'know, I used to hate the water... Think the tide's with us? What day is this? No... You think we can get back with those? I can't stand here doing nothing! What the hell? What's that, a ship? This has got to be one big violation... I wish it would rain... Wait a minute! I need you. That means closing the beaches. We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up. A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake! There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island. There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater. No shark did that to a boat! You all right? Be careful, for chrissake. Why don't we just tow it in? Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat? What happened? We gotta get back soon... You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job? Where'd you get all this? Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around? What is all this stuff? Chum? What do we do? He ate a car? How can you tell? What? What?! What's that? What stinks so bad? And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing? Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts? There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh... Something else. Do most attacks go unreported? Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach? Let's all have a drink. Swell. What d'ya mean? You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this? No, we just checked the beach... No, it was local jurisdiction. Who are you? You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy. Pretty stiff. What d'you pay for a place just for the summer? You here for the summer? You from around here? Think she might've run out on you? And nobody else saw her in the water? You picked her up on the ferry. Christine what? Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer. That wasn't funny. Get out of there � take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing. Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs? I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police... I'm responsible for public safety around here... Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering. Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was! What else could've done that?Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go! Look at him take it! Twenty years. Set? Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin! It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?Well... is everything all right? I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there? ...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream. ...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat. What's the matter with my printing? Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there. We never had any. What's the problem? I've got all these signs here... I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off. We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.I can't imagine why. Just keep kicking. Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think. Quint...? Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already! It's a whale out there. You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus... This is quite a place. I hope we get some more help. Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct. I know sharks. I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply... I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there. A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it! You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water. A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate... We will. There's something I've got to find out. He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull. They must've hit something. I want to check something. Hold my feet. It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life! I Bought it. Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal. Sometimes. Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us. Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band... And two loose nuts behind the wheel. Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him. It's a good time, too. They're night feeders... If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him. ...Nothing. No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here... Florida license plate. Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters. Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha! Our friend, the shark. ...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence. You could say that. It's called Territoriality. It's a theory. Rogue? About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims. Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught... We ought to let it breathe... Whatever. Dynamite! How was your day...? There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside. I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one... Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck. It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark. Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact. Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters. -- Did you go out in a boat and look around? ...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining. -- did you notify the coast guard? Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody? There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater. Yep. Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding... Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months. Going out on the 'Aurora.' Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one. I do. But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere. I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks. Is anyone having this...? Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him. Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close. He's under! He's heading under -- ! Coming right to us! The shaft is giving. Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what? I think I can top that, Mister... I'll drink to your leg. Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples... Ever see one like this? Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit. 20 feet, if it's an inch... What do you see? I'm okay... I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark. Let it go, don't waste your time. Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy. That's pilot whale, isn't it? Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh? Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. What's that supposed to prove? Anti-Shark cage. I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello. Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks... I don't need to pass basic seamanship. And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White. -- and an America's Cup Trials... I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs -- That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye. Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White. I don't have it. Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure... Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...What's going on with the beaches, Chief? I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this. ...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...? We're not even sure what it was.My cars. And a comic book. Sure, Dad. Dad, the ponds are for old ladies. I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it. My boat's neat, dad! Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.He's comin' up -- ! Full throttle! To port! Dead astern! Zig-zag! No! He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?! Have to pump her steady, s'all. No! No! No! Swing around! After him! Shut up! Just pump her out! The bilge pumps. There -- He's busting the shaft! Start the pump! Tattoo. Had it taken off. I almost had 'im. Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima. You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark... We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him. I never saw one that big. What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand? Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does? Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle. Unbuckle me -- fast! Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never -- Get behind me, dummy! Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line! Wet my reel, quick! ...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do. Nobody. We're drifting with the current. Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it. All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him... ...along for ballast. What do you mean 'We...?' I know who he is... Try some of this. I made it myself. And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch. And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property. And incidental damages, if any... And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not. Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise? Did you bring a check? Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out. He's busy. This is Quint, Missus. What can that gun of yours do? Follow him! No way! He can't! No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on -- Slower! Throttle back --- Easy! It'll tear right out! 'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944. ...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last. And I'll drink to yours. Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here -- Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here... ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas. Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off. 25 feet. And three tons of him there. At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine. Over there! Fasten the pole. A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge. Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here! Down here, Hooper! Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No? What's he playin' here? Put the gloves on! Let's see who's gonna tease who now! Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there... It ain't a Big Mac. The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too. Next time, ask me. Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing... Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap... Who's inside, you or the shark? Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut? Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower? Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait. Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means. Let me see your hands... Are you now. I know about porkers in the water -- Here. Tie me a sheepshank. I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking. Transplants?My kids were on that beach... I was acting in the town's best interests... Maybe we can save August... I don't know if I can do that without a... Why? August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend. You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic. I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems... What kind of a shark did you say it was? Let's all get out of here, this place stinks. Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben... do you have all the pictures you need? I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster. Who's that young man? That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper. Only 24 hours! No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin. Martin, we hired the best man we could find. I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things. All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island. Martin! Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority? C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say. Take my car, okay? You come with us, Lenny. Who've you told this to, Lenny? What have you got there, Lenny? Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns! Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished. Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it? I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state. That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
