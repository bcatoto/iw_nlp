Well, that just happened that time. Right here. Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything. Is there food? Yes. I'm cutting a record.Don't worry, I'll take care or it Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now? What? Go to the King Of the Road and thank her. Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang. Don't feel that way, honey. What's wrong honey. I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you. Your job, huh. No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this? I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules. I said 'no!' What? His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something? Whose word? How is that? He knows better. Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen. Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks. She's fine. Yes. You bet. What do you really want? I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home. She's going to rest now. Okay. Yes. She's pretty rested up. I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change. You know better than that. What! What does he want? Third party? Who the hell is he? Who the hell is he? A little slow, but she'll be fine.Okay. D.C.? Tammany Hall? He came there? Where'd he ever see us? How much? National television? What's he running for? Whose? Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home. You want anything? A drink? Hi. Come on in. Mary! Yes, but we're just singing. How come? It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him. When is it? Bastard He saw us at Tammany Hall. What crook? Yes. Percy Warner Park'. Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park... Hey!

Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough. Eater says she doesn't see how you do it. You'll have to speak up. Well, my wife, Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here. She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We've been following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I didn't mean to do that. Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you. Am I disturbing you? What? You want me to wait? I'm fine. Can I go up? Yes, ma'am. How are you today? Hi, Sherry. Ester and me did; My niece picked then. She's just here from California. Good night, Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are. A little. What do you need? Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like. When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you. My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing? I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything. I think we can do that. Come in. Can I help you? Maybe you can look after me a little. I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers. What did you say? Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul. It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix. She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday. I'1l get your bag. Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.I don't really know what you're talking about.
