Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they? She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem. No, it's a very groovy girl. I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house. Look, would you argue with your doctor? It's great. You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on... Yeah, baby, how's it going? Chicken salad, Devra! Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want? Holy Christ. You want to get us killed? She's a friend of Jill's. Well she... But aren't you... No, that's okay, I'll do It now. Hi. That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair. I know. No, I know. She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment? -- Anyway. I don't know. Just a minute... Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star. What about? Your husband? All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open. I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty. Whatever you say. You're looking great, baby. Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts... What kind of treatment? I'm coming, baby -- How's Otis doing, anyway? I'll have Mary wash you. Mary! I don't want to place you in any position -- What? -- What? Calm down, baby. But you don't know what happened. I gotta talk to you. I'll be right back, baby, really. I'll be back in a while. And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back. I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out. Wow. She did? I know. I don't know. Yeah, I think so. She's got a... These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas. I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks. Listen, baby, don't leave, really. I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes. My keys. No. Right now? Look... Do you wanna fuck me? You are. You are. That you're just like your mother. No. Yeah... Yeah. No shit. No kidding. Yeah, it is. What? ... just, you could look very heavy... I'd like to do your hair sometime. Am I what? Yeah... I've made it with a girl... Have you ever made it with a girl? What would my being a faggot have to do with that? Why do you wanna know so bad? Gee, this is great. ... yeah. Yeah. No thanks. No thanks. I do her hair, yeah. No thanks. A little. Yeah. I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers. Her hair, I do Barbara Rush. Well, I do Barbara Rush. I guess not... They are? Well, yeah... you know. Right, that's right. Right. Great. She is. Great. Right. Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl. Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here. Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying. Oh fuck, Norman! I've got heads here, Norman. Buffums? Yeah. What for? Don't leave me... Don't go, Jackie... I don't know... Jackie? So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me. What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late. So I'm saying it... Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me. I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot. No -- -- It's Malone's. It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going? Look about last night -- Where are you going? Why? I've got to leave? -- good afternoon -- -- Jesus -- I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you. -- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless. -- we're kidding ourselves. -- do you want ice? Not me, pal. -- yes, you -- Look who's talking. Mmmm -- -- mmm -- -- what? -- where'd you go? -- sure. Am I entertaining you? -- yeah. What are you looking at? He never stopped. Sammy's? That sounds like me. You were great. No you didn't. You were great. -- what? -- you are. Jackie, can we -- -- we can't now. Sweetheart, you're drunk. C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk. Don't do it. You don't do that anymore, do you? Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've -- Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair. -- this guy with Jill. -- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy? Look, either come in or stay out! Sit down! Sit down. I know... you don't know, I know. I don't want to... I swear... Yeah, baby... One of my few virtues is discretion. Baby... Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you? Yeah? Hey, I don't tell. Did I what? What? I won't screw you up. I just have to do one little thing. Did Lester know about him? Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something? Did you? And? Why not? Why not? Do you? You still see him? Jackie, would you argue with your doctor. Yeah... wow. It's hot in here. Whew. Yeah... I mean great. Great. Okay. No, I'm sure. Yeah, I think so... I'd cut it... Probably the bathroom. No, thanks. You going to tell him? Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he? I'm sure. How long you had this? Great... so how's everything with you? I don't know. Probably not. -- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't. -- Yeah... your car down here? Great. Who's been doing your hair? Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut! I'm busy, man. Yeah?... Oh yeah? Hey, what's happening? Mary! Telephone. What's the matter? She's heavy. See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense. What? No, man. -- c'mon, I'll get you home... -- how did you get here? -- why did you come in today? -- please, please forgive me... -- oh -- sweetheart... -- Otis? What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work? I don't know if you don't know -- -- White ladies? -- Oh yeah. -- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything. Wash her. Okay... thanks... I guess you haven't heard from her yet. -- yeah, this is -- I don't have your number, stop by the shop. Great, great. I hope you make it. Hey, baby, what's happening? Hey, stop by the shop. That's too bad. What did you say? What did you say? What did you say? Did you? Did you? Yeah, I know. Did you? Did you? -- tell me something -- did you talk about me? That's all you've got to say? Does it make you happy? What? What? What? What? What? Jesus. How? -- please, baby -- Baby, don't do this -- Baby, please don't... I love you. What difference does it make? What do you wanna know for? Obviously. Baby, don't do this. I do love you. Where did this come from? Well, did you get a job out of it at least? You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up. That was him. Oh, Christ. Didn't you, baby? You did fuck him, didn't you? You didn't plan on fucking him tonight. Well that's something. How come you took your own car? I do, Jill. I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you. -- okay -- -- I'll see you later. Your house. -- well aren't you -- I've got to get her out of here. Now, Jackie -- Television or movies? What does he direct besides traffic? Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up. Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing. What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit. Look at the way I live. A business meeting, I told you that. Who? Where's your car? Jill says nothing. Nothing, I'll call you, okay? Neither do I, baby. I'll call you. I'll call you. When I get off work. Look, baby, can we talk about it later? Right now? They didn't offer you the job yet. What do you want? Just a second, I'll be right with you... Honey, have they offered you the job? Going where? About what? Baby, I'm in the middle of work. Yeah, baby. Okay. Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia. Great... can we talk later? Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay? Go where? Yeah. Hey, I'm, you know -- Great. Yeah, baby... Jill, say hello to Felicia. Great. Hey, baby, what's happening? Okay, baby. Okay... What! Okay... Night, baby. I'm around you and I like you, don't I? Of course I like children. -- Sure. We live together now. Yeah, baby. Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you. Yeah. You're great. You're different. I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something. I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life. When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe. Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen. I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together. Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible. How are you, baby? Nobody's gonna get you but me! Keep moving -- You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside. Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside. No shit? You said somebody... who? Who? What? Well, like what? What's gonna happen? Well, it's a big canyon. Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute. Where? What're you talking about? Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut. But I don't want to place you in that position either. Said what! You need a cut. No. What're you here for? What? Yes I do. No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay. No -- Lester, it just happened. What about her? I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't. Oh yeah... Hey, you were never going to give me the money. Who? I know. Okay, thanks. No thanks. Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know? Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her. We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings? ... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that? Didn't they tell you? What, do you think I planned it? Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do. I'm not anti-Establishment. What can I say! Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything. Oh Jesus Christ. But... Now wait a minute... Well, what? Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something? Well... who are those guys? Yeah. How long have you been here? Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out -- This really ought to be layered... No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it. Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day? Well anyway... -- yeah? I don't know what to... Oh, hey... ... this doing hair it's... It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset. That, and... I'll be done in a minute. ... she's very upset... That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door. I know what you mean. Oh yeah? Okay. Tonight? When? Oh yeah? I mean I know. Oh yeah. Sure. You're right. They're not? Thank you. After a while that hurts... doesn't it? I'm better than the guy I work for. In a way. But... Yes it is. Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser. Thank you. Well, yeah.Hello. Okay. I guess so. I guess so. It isn't? No. Her? No. I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times. No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something. Hey, I tried to get her off the phone. Let it ring. Uh-uh. Nobody can hear it. ... what?... Okay, okay... I'll call you back... I'll call you back. No. No. I... uh... I... uh... can't. Wasn't sure it was you. Yeah, yeah -- 'bye. Okay. What do you mean? I'll call you back. Yeah.See you later. I'll call you. Oh yeah? I have to meet a client... who're you dating? Jackie, what're you doing?What are you talking about? Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks -- -- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not. That's okay too. Can't we go into this later, sweetheart? -- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally --- Yes, sweetheart, shh. Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit -- What do you expect me to do about it? -- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear -- It's just -- fabulous. Think you could do anything for me? No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right. What? You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea? Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy. I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me. Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that. That kid... the hairdresser. Do you think George is a fairy? Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know. Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap. I'm finished with her. You really think so? Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore. She's nothing but a whore. I mean, how did that happen? What about Jackie? Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter. I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore. ... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson! I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore. Me! Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say. I'll have to wash one out. You don't have a clean glass in the house. Have a drink. Want a drink? Well, I don't know. Why, why do you think that is? Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little... ... yes, I follow your thinking on that. I wanna hear it from you! Did they have something against me? Was it me, did you have something against me? No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry. That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you. I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment! I wanna hear about it. I wanna hear about it, George. I wanna hear about it. I said sit down! Sit down. Godammit, George... Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something. What do they look like?... All night. You live like a pig. Layered? Isn't that bad for it? Your hair looks -- well fabulous. See she doesn't drink too much. -- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight -- Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that. It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me -- George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation. I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher. I know it, I know it. You look like you've had quite a work-out. What about, tonight? Sorry, honey, I... -- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something. I wish my son knew what he wanted to do. -- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here. Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there. When? So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject. Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people. Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she? George, could you -- excuse us for a minute? Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to... No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right? But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into. It's good you want to do something, George. Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves. But what? But the important thing is you're successful at it. It's an unusual trade. I see. I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work? She says you're a fabulous hairdresser. Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser. Oh, dear that's too bad. -- get her out of here, get her out of here. Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia. Hi, doll, what's wrong? C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George -- Who's the guy, George's boyfriend? Does she know about us? Who are they? Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope. George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll. Why not? Aren't you going to have one? They get hair all over the place. You ought to get rid of those dogs. I'd like a drink. Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay? What's that? Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share. It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth... Of course not. Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base. I'm not jealous of the dogs. Then you were talking to him. Whatever his name is, that actor. My secretary saw you with that boy. Who were you talking to? I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone. George is going to open a shop. Is that right? Is that right? How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie. -- just wonderful. Gee... that's wonderful, Jill. Jill. What did you say your name was, sweetheart? That's fine -- -- oh no, honey, I'll do that... -- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here. Oh that's no problem. -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene? -- what's the problem, honey? Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink. Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink? Call me Les. Everything okay, son? No of course not. Have they sat down?You are today. You do it. What! You're late, George. Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon. You promised you'd do the show. Yes, Buffums. You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums. George!Not yet. -- yes, George. Jackie Shawn.Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms? I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy. Pardon me? What sort of references do you have? It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it. After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days. Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it. You do know what money's like these days. And you need money? So you want to go in business for yourself? I went to school with her husband. Wonderful woman. How is she? Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.I'm telling you he won't know the difference. -- he'll never know the difference. What's wrong? -- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again. Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes. You're going. Two weeks from tomorrow. You mean when are you going to Egypt? Of course not. -- these bastards have me hemmed in. Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party. -- oh I don't know -- George is a hairdresser, isn't he? I don't think so. Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room. This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well? Not with your hairdresser. -- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser? Good for you. What does he do? Is he an actor? I'm terribly sorry. My God, did I say that? I don't believe it. I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you. -- sort of a boyfriend? Is he an enemy? All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend. Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds. Sure. Go ahead, Jill, you can say it. Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad. That's right. Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party. Where to, Les? Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys. -- we're going to be here all night. Everybody but us. I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.Thanks for coming by. We'll let you know tomorrow. John... Do you have something against traveling? Are you married? Do you have children? Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location. Three weeks. You seem disappointed.If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up! She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again. You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here. Wanda... I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone. She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is! -- Right after I sprayed her? Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?Yes. Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like. Sid. Well maybe I can get you something.
