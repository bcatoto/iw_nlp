Can't be that far, I say. Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here. Smells like a cunt. Bad sign... We should have seen land. He's the devil's child... With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear? What are you listening to, chicken ass? You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...! Bastard! I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it. Blind faith is what I consider heresy! Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world? No. The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people. I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God. Trade, Your Excellency. According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold. If they agree to follow me, yes. Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter. And that is to make the journey. I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible. Excellency, you are right. I am, Your Eminence Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks. I can't keep my eyes off you. I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you. Can't you stay with us a little? Not everything... Do you think I care? I'm a free man again. Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier... God... you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me... I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service. Beatrix, I want to ask you something. I don't want you to wait for me. She said yes. Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman... Are we going to argue? I haven't given you much of a life. I could be gone for years. How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it would. How far from here? Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland. Appointment to what? Yes... I remember... Bartolome and Giacomo Colon. Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken. Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet... He never had one... except aboard my ships! What does he say? What are you listening to? There must be a passage to that other ocean. How are you feeling, Fernando? I have to explore the mainland. Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them! There'll be a time. All of them created by people like me. What do you see? Look out of that window. Call them. What...? Do I have so many already? Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves! But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration. ... for a commoner? They don't see sin in their nakedness. They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And... And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us? I'm not bargaining! NO...! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No... I will not be your servant! No... Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me. You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did! Ask him if he will help. We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands? He has medicine. Tell him we admire his people. ... and also to bring medicine. To bring the word of God. Thousands. Tell him his country is very beautiful. Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort. Tell the Chief we thank him. What is it? A tribe? An island? I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much. I still can't accept the world as it is! New worlds create new people. I have to disagree. You'll always be older than me, Father. Give me absolution. You are bound by an oath, Father. If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me... I am not sure... It could be twice the distance. I lied. The journey will be longer than I said. Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you. Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned. All of them! Just lies! Damn all of you! You all set up theories based on what? You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out! Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to! Damn God! Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait? I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity! Passion is something one cannot control! I'll try to remember that, Marchena... So was Christ! The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras... Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands. To open a new route to Asia. At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it... How did you manage it? God... That's in a week! Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him. And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself. Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things. I must see them with my own eyes. I cannot be other than I am. Thank you. They come and go as naked as the day God created them... Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you? I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks... "What if?"... May I speak freely? Surely you can do anything you want. What did they say about Granada before today? No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors. You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions. Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say? In one act of brutality, you have created chaos. Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us! All that because of your criminal savagery! Don Moxica -- we all have to work. We can't raise the wheel without it. We came here to stay! To build! Not to start a crusade. In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days! So we will be brave and swallow our grief. And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for. You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe? If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say. The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica. He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus. What do you read? Come over here. And what do you think Mendez? Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us... You're right. Let the men decide. Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that! You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember? And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that! The land is there. I know it! You think I don't know that? We have to keep the hopes of these men alive! Six days ago, yes. Where can I meet this man?Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind. I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything. He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address. I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing. Father... Not bad. This time with me! Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven? You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher...? I want to go with you!Oh? So you are a new man? I knew you would. I suppose we're both old men now. I believed in you... My son, my son... Your certitudes are sometimes frightening... Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will. May God forgive you...! You must tell them! You must tell your men! How long? What are you saying? I am listening, my son. In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti. Colon! Don't! Colon! If God intends you to go, then you will go. You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait. Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son. You get so carried away when you are being contradicted! Father Marchena! Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon. Esdras is a Jew. How can you be so certain? How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite. Why do you wish to sail west? With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool. That's what it says. Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different mothers...We can't be. What's he doing? Twenty eight. Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before. Well... It's the men, Sir. They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago... God be with us admiral.You will regret this. Savagery is what monkeys understand. You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse. My horse doesn't work. We don't need to know. We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood. And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.You tell that to them! You bloody... Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you! You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back! We're lost! We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon! You must be mad...! You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues! Immediately.We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near. We'll all go crazy... Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm. The water's going putrid in the barrels.A waste...? Let me tell you something, Arojaz. If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his. You can see for yourself. On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross. Indeed. The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them. My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain. Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography. The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence... Roofs... towers, palaces... spires... I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer. All I have to do is call the guards. To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation. A little hypocrisy goes a long way. You seem to have a special talent for making friends. Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal. You defend yourself admirably... Forgive me, Don Colon. But what about gold? If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will. Then you are too ambitious. I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me. No? Then why? He must be replaced. ... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility... Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying. But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty. ... Into a monk... Never, Your Majesty. Although... Yes, Your Majesty.That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in, You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand? No. How could you understand. So what are you doing here? I was gonna bring it back myself. You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again. You took the chalice.I know. Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool. There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right? How are you doing, man? The rich kind. Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide. That stuff'll kill you quick, man.I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you.Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine. OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it? Oh, really? Let me think about it. What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game? All right, cop. I want my money.Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want. You've really got a problem. That 50 G could help you -- The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember? How's the case going? He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it? You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids -- You're a fucking joke, you know that? He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that! This psycho can. Don't bullshit me. Do you have the money? Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac! Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it! Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind? OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do? Are you sure? How about 7 1/2? All right. What are you gonna do?I'm a Catholic. The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to -- I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win! You mean you could use it. A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him. Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man... Nah... Yeah. Those fucking Mob assholes. Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands. It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me. You gotta believe me! Yeah. People. What's to believe? The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way. Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns! She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ. They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would. Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in -- Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man! Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow. Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow. Fuck you. Just give me back a little something for the road. What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you? Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good. Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I -- Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why? Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me! Hate me! Help me! Hate me! Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that. You can't forgive me. After what I've done. I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad. Me? Yeah, sucker. You better be there! Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop! There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing. Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet. It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game. Large? -- that there was never any other way it could have gone. Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what? Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that -- Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet. What case? I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic. Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and -- Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in. Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game. I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone. What money? That's my problem. Just put in my bet. There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out. I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money I wanna go double or nothing on the next game. Yeah. I'm sure. Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money. I want 15 on the Mets. I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.You knew them? Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew? Yes, Sister? I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer. It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt. Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --Sit down! You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck! Yes you are. It's all a big game isn't it? A sick, fuckin' game. I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out. Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place. It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish. You're a lying bastard! You sure you weren't over on Pine Road? We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there. Homesearchers. Then what's he talking about? There's a photostat of the original on the wall. You got it on the board. Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker. I used to. With my old man. He taught me how to hunt and trap. Trapping's a lot harder than most people think. We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields. When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed. But they're crafty little devils. You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent. You ever smell Raccoon scent? Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy. He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it. You know why? Cause he can't help himself. The scent drives him. So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap. You ever do any hunting, Peter? Of course it was. Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering. That's a felony. The door was open. That's right. I guess only the killer would know that. You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it. You think I'm right? You don't tell us how to run our investigation. You got that? We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor. What in the hell do you think you're doing? Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace. Are you crazy? What? All you gotta do is look at the map. What do you mean, no? Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random. Oh, we'll be back. You can bet on it. You like to play games, don't you, Peter? It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent. You are! I don't like you. Casual? You were boning her weren't you? I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem. We seem to have a little problem here? By yourself? I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly? I gotta friend over there. He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records. You know, give him something to do. You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway. I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer. Ready for round two? What is it? I spoke to Jeremy. He's watching Sanderson's kid. Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since. I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel. You alright? How is she? We've checked. There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island. Yeah, I am. I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else? The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy. I think he's a first- timer. Sorry. No shit! I'm sorry, this is just too convenient. We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games. You think he's dirty? What do you think? No. She just moved here last month from Portland. Debi Rutlege. Female. Caucasian. Twenty four. Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel. Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank. We'll find the evidence. Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective. You can't possibly be unbiased. Oh, c'mon. We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we? It doesn't mean anything. It's Sanderson! Don't fuck with us! Where did you go! But a hundred men could move him. What was suspicious about him? Did anyone look suspicious? Think! Did anyone stand out? I don't know. Maybe there's two of them. Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls. Why does he call Sanderson? You should be an actor, Frank. You looked like you were really mad. The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her? Very good. How did you know? I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter. Don't beg, Peter. She has to die. I can't win unless she dies. You're groping. I have been fair. It's my move now. No. As usual you're wrong. It is her I want. Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat. The game's over. You lost. She's in the other room. I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now. Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. It's check, Peter. No you haven't. And even if you had it doesn't matter. Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call. By that time the game will be over. Emotional? I expected more from you. Hello, Peter. --you're hopeless! You can't even read a sentence! Didn't they teach you punctuation in school? The game ends tonight! Interesting concept. I hadn't thought of that. If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it. The police haven't told you? I used a variation. You should have anticipated that. Have you figured out the message? Very good. Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? Have you figured out what I'm doing? Very nice speech, Peter. Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu? There's an old wooden bench in the garden. Next to it is a rock. You'll find a message for you under it. Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are. The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time. What makes you think I was there? What? I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. Not that you're playing it very well. Have you any idea what the message is? So is mine, within the framework of my rules. I couldn't say it any better than Huxley. Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game. Pain? Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have. Just for that no hint today. I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say. You're not playing very well. There are clues all around you and you keep missing them. I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me. I find it irritating, not to mention insulting. I know what I said! She looks just like... Because she's the type. Not really. Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter? I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight. "Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town. Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown. Crawling through the window. At the end of Miss Emma's street. Her God has gone and left his home. So her and I can meet." I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter? You'll find her. I did another one last night. You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play. You don't want to think and that's why I'll win! I'm already two points ahead. That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions. We all have paths to follow. You hope yours will lead you to me. No, only the path she chose to travel. To get your attention. Very amateurish, Peter. I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic. I'm not an idiot! Don't treat me as one! I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you! Are you ready to play? Hello, Peter. Someone who's going to become an important part of your life. I want to play a game with you. Hello, Peter.Don't you see? I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing. I sat with them all. I held their hands. I stroked their hair. I was with them to the end. I took away the blood. I washed them. Their crossing was peaceful. They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother... There was so much blood... It covered everything. You don't understand. The scars on your chest. From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen. You still haven't figured it out, have you? You think that I've put you through an ordeal. My scars run so much deeper than yours. New York. 1986. Viktor Yurilivich. 1985. Hans Korshaud. There's three. The first is 1983. Lionel Baines. The Boston... Now what? Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games. Nope. Nothing. No problem. We're in. Sure. We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York. Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter. I hope you don't mind. Naw, it's all fixed. I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.You're losing me. He was watching you. Why did he what? You're safe. He wouldn't come here. Kathy, please. You're going to wear a hole in the carpet. You don't want to believe it. It's a normal reaction. Feeling better? It worked out alright, didn't it? They asked who would be best suited for this and you-- I admit I handled it badly. Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive-- The police came to me for help. What could I do? Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests. You might not have done it had you known.I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him. Let him sweat for a little while. It's a voice modulator. Find him! I want to talk to him. Sanderson? I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich? She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it. Maybe he's going to drug her? You still having a problem with this? Check with the State. If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it. Nolan? Anything? Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal? Take it easy. Both of you. What was your relationship with her? I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying. He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi. Local? Run it down. That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message. How long she been dead? Same as the others? That's great. There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island. We'll check that out. What about the blood? You mean, no prints but hers? What about prints? Anything? There's no blood. Where's the fuckin' blood? Any sign of rape? How long has she been dead? Whaddaya got, Nolan? Okay. Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later. I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with tonight? Did you see his face? The most logical choice. We're going to work on the message. We can't rely on your judgement anymore. He's right, Kathy. What time did he get there? Yes. Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure? That's a big area to cover. It can't be a coincidence. The woman that owns it has a son. She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days. We're trying to locate him. There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week. We're checking that out too. Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have. All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night. They're all the same type. All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers. What did he mean by Huxley? You never know how you're going to catch a suspect. This ain't no photo. Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty. Call dispatch. Double the patrols. I want that area blanketed. I don't think it matters. Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center. I was thinking the same thing. He must be local. It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name. What about this? Anything else? What about the way he arranged the body? Kathy? It could have been a tape. A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself. No. I told him to. I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end. And this Jeremy-- It's important. We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation. We're not sure. What did Dr. Fulton tell you? You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy? Well? Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also? Do you know how she found the apartment? Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in. How long ago was that? If you can think of anything else give us a call. It's over, Peter. Let's stop the games. I'm not sending a car. Alright, c'mon Peter. We're moving you to a cell. I understand that this is just another one of your games. Maybe he just got tired of covering for you. Answer the question. Where were you last night? Wait a minute. There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms. He uses castles...plural -- then says "can't move me." Singular. Not can't move us. A building? It's a commercial area. No one lives there. I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you. There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board. How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him. It doesn't make sense. "Is". Did you tell him about the institute? We think he might be making a reference to drugs? Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine. Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories. "Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street." We think he might be making a reference to himself. That's alright. We'll take it from here. Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard. She's a psychologist helping us out. Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier? What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing. Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number. This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room. Here's one at 9:04 pm. It says: From Debi. Please call me at home. I know. You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five. Where did you go after that? Could you tell me where you were last night? I know you're busy so I'll get right to it. Did you know her?Feel like practicing? She went into town with Mrs. Lutz. Did they get him? Exactly... and you did this. What do you see here? Whatever's on your mind. Just thought you might want to talk. You're always in the middle of a match. Peter... Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it. You don't win by playing it safe, Peter. On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique. He knows you're aware of that.I'd say at least eighteen hours. Yeah. Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you? This is where he forced his way in. We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope. Not a drop. Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross. He tapes their mouths shut. We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths. We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store. No Frank. No prints. No prints. Not much. I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath. Bingo. Not that I can see. We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle. Six, eight hours tops. Not much. There's no sign of a break in. I think she let him in.The message! I figured out-- What? Get off me! Fuck you! I'm tired of your goddam accusations! If you want to arrest me go ahead! Otherwise back off. I'm positive. I was at the beach. Then let's narrow it down. If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we? He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it. He's not talking about himself. No, I need the original note. What if he doesn't bite? What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon? No. What do you want? No it wasn't. How'd you get in here? I wouldn't know. You don't have an investigation without me. You got that? Maybe you should. You think you're going to catch him on a trace? Everything he does is planned out well in advance. The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up. Let's see how much he wants to play. Not what -- who. Morpheus. The Greek God of dreams. Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home." Morpheus. His victims aren't random. It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it. He says it's a game. All games have a strategy. No. He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven. Why not come back then and listen for yourself. That's crazy! Why would I draw attention to myself like that? What's that supposed to mean? Fine, don't ask me out on a date. It wasn't serious. What's your problem? Casual. What are you saying? What kind of problem? Yes. Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes. People have a lot of free time. They like to gossip. You told me. When you called you said she was in the other room. Drop the knife. The pipes. I know where you are. No! Wait!! I'll give you anything you want. Anything! Please! That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley? "His play is always fair and just." It's me you want. Not her. Please... wait. Let me speak to my daughter. Yes? I've figured out the message. If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent. You sonofabitch! I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything. Remember eventually revenge- - They think that you and I are doing this together. What word did you leave last night? You're next move should have been e2- e3. You're playing the Tarakoss opening. Hello. It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know. Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall! I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. You heard me. Why did you go out to the institute looking for her? You like to brag, don't you? If it's so important, why don't you just tell me? Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just." How? And you want these girls to feel your pain? Why are you doing this? You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people. Then call them! I'm just trying to play the game. Just like who? But you said you didn't know her. Why her? You know her? Hello? You're not going to tell me that. If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it! Where is she? What? Why not? Why did you write remember on the wall? And -- what path is that? Did you know her? Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege? Just a second. Hello? I haven't got time for this. Who is this? What scars? Computers. That's how you got into Homesearchers records. You can get into anything. But why? Why? What is it? He's in his seventies and lives in Holland. Never mind. He died two years ago. Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me. There can't be more than a handful. D2-d4... b1-c3... and c1-f4. It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening. David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years. Set up some pieces on the big board? Okay. Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island. Can we correlate data? Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that? Of course not. What's this? Thanks. It isn't Kathy. I'm sorry, honey, I can't. Not today. For what? Don't you have something you want to say to David? Nothing. Has he gotten through to any? Who told you that? You want to sleep in my bed tonight? I see. You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you? What are you doing up? My cheering section. Did you send the car? I signed the confession. What about the car? Look, I'll do anything you want! I'll sign anything you want! Just send a car out to the hotel. Don't you understand what I'm telling you? That's why he wants me out of the way. This is insane! Can't you see what's going on. The killer wants me out of the way. He's setting me up. Jeremy would have never killed himself. I went out. Are we going to go through this again? That's got to be it. A shadow. What's as big a castle? As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it? The shadow of the castle. Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building? He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it. A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved? As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me. It's posed as a question. What am I? But he had to dump the body there to make the move. That's all he needs. He's making the moves. It's an opening. I just can't remember the name. Okay, it's a game. He's starting it, so he moves first. He's white. e2-e4. Maybe I already have. He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!! As large as castles. You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me. Another one? What word did he leave? Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill? That's it? Maybe, but I don't think so. I think it's just a tease. What have you come up with on the riddle? You want me to go with you? Maybe I can help. We've already met. Haven't we... Doctor. I don't know. I was afraid there'd be hours of questions. I can't afford to miss a game. I got it from the tournament directory. She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow. To my room and then I went for a walk. Here. I played Gregory Lutz. Only in passing. To say hello to. Yeah. Just let me grab a shower. No. Mate in five. Who says something's on my mind. About what? You have something you want to say? I want to be the best I can. I've got be here for the police when they come. Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now. Is it serious? We got a problem? It's a good play, but risky. I suppose you have something in mind? Then I'll transpose. You opened with the English. Lutz won't use it. He opened his first game with it. Do we have a future? It's over now. I got lucky. Are you going to come tonight? This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it? You're right. The killer told me. Frank told me. It's got to be grammatically correct. If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be. He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word. Because I know what it says. This letter. I've never opened it. Because she killed herself!! But I do. It's not that easy. You don't understand. I can't think any more, unless it's about you. I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile. Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard? Ever since my wife died I've been... I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them. No, listen. You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now. You really haven't seen my best side. I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could... The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have. I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did. Can I come in? Right. Here! c-4. He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces. All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse. Why? Where's the note? A fierce magazine... brutal... An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine... fierce... Mad. Exactly. It's the key. In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart? How could you think that, Kathy? How could you even consider it? --admit what? That I was right about you in the steam room? That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want? Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room? Then why are you backing up? What's wrong? I thought you said the line was busy? Did you call? If I have to. I'm going to take a shower. You. Fine. Call room service. No. I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved. This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time. I just don't want to fight with you. What are you talking about? You don't even know me. What? By attacking me? What is this? I'm not playing a game now. What? It was. It's alright. It was a long time ago. She died in a car accident. Alright. What about me? Wasn't I just talking about me? You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to. No. But I'm open to distractions. Why? Doesn't that scare you? I know you didn't I know it was bad. Relax. You're not? Why? I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone? Let me ask you something? Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not? Very good. Spoken like a true psychologist. When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations. What is that Masters and Johnson? Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there? You mean like in the steam room? I'm just curious. Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Are you married? Do you? What about you? Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry? Take your average cop. They deal with death everyday. If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement. Oh, but it is. He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him. That's a game. It has rules and objectives. In a way. I think it's interesting. It wasn't intentional. It's going to be a long night. It could take hours before we know something. You should try to eat. You sure you don't want to eat something? She could be dead now. I can't right now. I've got a game. I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down. Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet? No you didn't. What are you looking for? Getting too hot in here for you? Each circumstance requires a different tactic. Are we talking about me, or chess? It is. I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation. I see. This is going to be a very polite conversation. What shall we discuss? The weather? Movies? If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion? Chess is a reflection of life. Life is violent. The strong win. The weak perish. Not really. You see your goal and you go after it. Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed. When I was very young. Yes. Uh huh. No. I don't. How come you don't stay with them? Yes. Sorry. I thought it was empty. Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win. You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous? I'm sure you are.Yeah. No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks. Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a chance -- I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me. That really you, Red? Now. That's what it is. Walk on out. There's two guns on you. I don't want your money. You know it. You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you. You're a damn liar. I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam. Shit, what else she gonna say? You never had it. You din't have no 1, 2, 8. What you talking? I'll take your goddam bet. Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth. Bet you are. Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there? It hit? I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down. I told you less paper, less trouble. Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street? How's it feel? Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down. You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something. When? I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job. Why? Did you just now con me? Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do. 'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig? YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you. I like you, country. Is your papa West Indian? You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy? How 'bout that? Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown. Heard where? When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out. Bet you like that shit. You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks. What they call you? Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle. What you say? The dirty yellow rat bastard. Yeah, got to do something about you. That's a fact. What you do, boy?You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right? Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other. I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty. You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it. Tell Him that. Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm? -- the hardest and the greatest. For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth -- -- the hardest and the greatest. For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth -- But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission. A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light. The body is a holy repository. No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men. I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils. Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm -- Who are you? No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you? I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history. Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years. The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that. Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening? Read it and keep on reading. Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here -- Look 'em up and and out what they mean. You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out. They sure ain't no black man's books in here. Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability. Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you. Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con? But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary? I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black. Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog. I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork. Don't con me. Don't con me. Don't try... I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind. What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done? What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix. Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart. The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light. I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white. Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white. Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then. Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black? Why? Why does everybody conk? Putting all that poison in your hair. When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you. 'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it. That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me. I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype. You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some. Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.I'll have it tomorrow. Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar. Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you. Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you -- Next week, Brother Minister. No, Brother Minister. All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.Down front as always. Let's cancel. Brother Minister, what is wrong? I assumed... I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you? Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend. I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people. Let some of us come down there. Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city. Let's get out of this cold. I'm tired of praying.Just what are you saying? Now just a moment, just a moment -- I told you we don't know for certain. Just what is your question? That's right. I don't think we know for certain. Why don't you just ask your question? Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims. Did you see the papers today? No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all. If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility. Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you. "His greatest greatness." Are you Elijah's pimp? Can I ask you something?The sentences to run concurrently. Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years... Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you. Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it. Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but -- I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet. You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah. Take it easy, baby. Let Billie finish. And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down. I'm wearing, Archie. I'll give you back the 600. It's me or you, ain't it, Pops? Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying. Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped. The bitch was there. Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me. 1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it? You owe me six big ones. Daddy, where's my money? 1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1. I git 'em all? Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now. Baby, what's today? I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill. Nnnnnnn! I'm working on it. Let 'em come. I'm ready. Solid, daddy. What? Just now. I done told the man what he could do with his train. 'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Lemme write it down for you. Where can I get a hold of you? No, my mama. She's from Grenada. My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist. Man's rep travels. Where I come from. Boston. Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know. Keeps me out of the army. I'm working trains. Selling. Red, and I ain't no punk. He had it coming. "I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle." Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street? I want to. God knows I want to. I don't know how. Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house. I don't know what to say to Allah. I want to, Bembry, but I can't. I can't. I want to, Bembry, but I can't. I can't. I will do it. I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women. I sure met some. Then the devil is white. I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan. Little. A black man playing big league ball is something. You pitch, baby; I'll ketch. Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood. Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens. Where am I gonna start? Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words. Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at? Then what you telling me to study in them for? That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books? I can't make out that shit. Okay, okay. Show me, man. What the hell for, man? What for? What? Everybody knows God is White. Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft. That's what Mama used to say. What do you do with your time? Okay, okay. Tell you this: you ain't no fool. You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none. I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay? Elijah who? Man, I don't want to hear all that. Leggo. I got to wash it out. I ain't said I'm ashamed. Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like -- Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats. You ain't lying. What did you give it to me for then? Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more? If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype? Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk. Man, what do you want? Who the hell are you? Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact. We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true. I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly. Do you? What can I do for you? Make it plain. Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show? Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program. Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister. Is the program ready? Come, sit with us. You are now Benjamin 2X. I don't think that's such a good idea. At the Hilton. The girls asleep? Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody. Betty it's me. It's me. We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it. Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together. I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father. You have to sleep for three. What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? Our people need me. The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me. Is that what this is about? Material wealth? Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life. I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing. Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you? I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight. There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger. There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation? Talk about what? I just want to sit here and be still. I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that. How do you know? Why are you looking at me like that? What do you think? I'll be away a lot. It will be rough. It won't be easy. I love you. I think so. Can you catch a plane? Did you hear what I said? At a gas station. Will you marry me? I'm in Detroit. What have you set your mind to? Are you? How old are you, Betty? Just an idle question. No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you? They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it? You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family. Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me. Let's talk about you for a change. Delicious. Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda. That's something I haven't done in fifteen years. I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours. So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul. Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand? What points? Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms. Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why? What? Is my family here yet? The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for. What did I tell you about assuming? Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else. So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night? I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me. No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right. I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight. Brother Earl. I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this. That's enough, Brother Earl. I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray. I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black. But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black. Then we don't know that God was white. What color were the original Hebrews? As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew. They were Hebrew, weren't they? You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they? Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em. Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one. Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger. You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree? Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture." For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate. Please, go ahead. Yes, sir, I did. Allah Akbar. Let me do it then. If you want to tell me. Say what you're saying. What? Sure, man. Is she hooking? She know? With him? Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot? Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's. I say a lot of things. Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think. Let's go. All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin. Baby, I'll call you tomorrow. I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest. I mean it's late, baby. I better not come in. Now you come back. And don't come back. I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home. No. You'll be marked for death. What does Sidney say? What mission? How long has this been going on? Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you? Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do. How many you turning out? Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later. Well, bitch you move too slow. You will, baby -- if the time come. Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister? What's your story, baby? You better believe it. You hear me, girl? C'mere. Shhhh! I don't like women that talk. Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty. How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone? I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind. It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us. Palmed it right in the goddam chamber. Yeah. Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die. That ain't bad. Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this. Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got? Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby? You're too small to be Bogart. The hell you are. Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size. Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart. Make it too easy and it ain't no fun. Fine as May wine. Shorty, this is Laura. Well, all reet, then. Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you? Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this. Head nigger in charge? You want to be the head man? Might be all right. So what about him? What can you do? Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that. Only a pig could do a thing like that. Brothers of Brother Johnson. I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out. Allah will provide. Are you sure? He told you that?I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible. They talked about me like I didn't know then that I was a nigger. I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle. We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss. I'm the man. That's right. Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge? So? The man got silver, china, rugs -- Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off. I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.He gave it to you, Archie. He did. Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man. You putting a hurtin' on my vision. Man live by his rep.Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket. You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet. Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort? Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind. I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear. Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts. What did you do, Homey, palm it? You the man! Tell him about Baldy. Jesus, Red, she's just a kid. I ain't doing bad. I'm not too short to be Cagney. I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes. I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest. Bang, bang. You're dead. Eat lead, coppers. Except she live on the hill and got a grandma. That's a fine chick. Hey, man, gimme some skin. Well, all right, then.You're my father. Let me die then. I'm with you, Brother Minister. To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep. All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all. Another one? Please make way, please -- Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation. 500.Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave. Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years. But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book. The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --Yes. Your boss even said there wasn't a set up. I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place. You're coming back to work for us, right? Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker. Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth. No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it. You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot - That I should've picked you up? I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time. How ya doin', Toothpick? Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy! The motherfucker killed Vic. I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense. I don't know what he did to her, but she got even. No. She was from Ladora Heights. Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E. Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois. A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue? I'll call somebody. Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know. Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up! Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening. Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him. Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now. Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on. This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker. Really? Who's your P.O.? Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me. Daddy, did ya see that? Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right? Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her. Pam Grier. It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar." I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen. There is no fuckin' set up! Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you. What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place. Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside. You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop. You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend. Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them. I take it this is the bastard you told me about. Why the hell are you beating on him? Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue? Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up. And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up? Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it? Bullshit. What? Nobody set anybody up.He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy. I can do that. I gotta memorize all this shit? What? But what is this? What? What's this? Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too. Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that. Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em. The Brewers. A little. Me and Mr. White? The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies. No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well. Who, Mr. White? The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange. Nice Guy. When we got to the bar... Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team? I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me... I'm sorry. You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds? Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area. Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store. I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out. You can do some crazy things with it. Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station. ...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.Tell me more about Cabot. The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you. It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it. Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job. It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal. A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job. It's a scene. Memorize it. Didja use the commode story? What kinds questions did Cabot ask? Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face. The Milwaukee Brewers? What about? Yeah. Did the two of you talk? How can you tell? Yeah. You ever seen this motherfucker before? ...What bar? This better not be some Freddy joke.That's okay, Eddie, I do. Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya. Didn't I tell ya not to worry? Vic was worried. We can work this out, can't we? Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem. What? Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda - It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more. Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans? What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you? Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick. How is he? Who's your parole officer? Take a seat. Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin? How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it? Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name? Wong? Chew? Toby Chew? No. Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl. Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think... Dead as Dillinger. Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink? You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink. I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow. Cause you're a faggot, alright? But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name... ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly. Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink. Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move. See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants. I'm not askin', I'm betting. Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this. Larry, I'm gonna kill him. Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much. You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more. He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up. You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed. Like hell I am. That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops. Juicy, junior, real juicy. Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont. Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd. What for? Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice? Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's. What's she doin' now? Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya? I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip. And when I come back, I want my book back. No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too. I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it. Give me my book. What do you care? Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now. What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back! I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name? Aren't you? Shut up! Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast. He don't believe in it? You don't believe in it? He don't tip? You don't tip? Why? Mr. Pink? Why? Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed! That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard! I do. How do I look? Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago. Your name's Freddy something. I know.Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get. I asked you a question. Are you clear about that? First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that? Thanks, don't mind if I do. Now where were we? Alone at last. I don't like alarms. I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive. You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah." Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you. You didn't ask. Nice Guy Eddie. It's a surprise. Down to my car. I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite." You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite? Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got. What're you talkin' about? What's this guy's problem? So, talk. Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale. It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin." Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain. Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought. It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about. Nope. He don't believe in it. He don't tip. Mr. Pink. And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door. Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away. Shit. I don't remember that at all. Freddy Newendyke. You do? You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up. Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive. I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor. Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes. I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe. Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die. I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad. Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die. Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me. Joe. I'm okay. No, I'm not! All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.He's right about the ear, it's hacked off. What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now. No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier. I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love? The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once. "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills." Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up. We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up. I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station. So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up. Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue. I don't know, but somebody did. What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other? Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out. The cops were there waitin' for us! We were set up, the cops were waiting for us. Mr. Blue's dead? Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on. Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple. Why can't we pick out our own colors? Why am I Mr. Pink? Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't. These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy. Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times. I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job. I don't believe in it. Uh-uh. I don't tip. No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade. Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it? Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade? Yeah, those guys too. I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out. ...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women. He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store. I told ya he'd be pissed. Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit... And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy... And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy. Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops. Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground! I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another. Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down! We don't think this place is safe. He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long. Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror. And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't. We ain't taking him to a hospital. Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows: what you look like, what your first name is, where you're from and what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection? One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from? Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful - And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to? Why! You didn't tell him your name, did ya? Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision. Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em. Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible. You gotta idea, spit it out. Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up. We can't take him to a hospital. He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure. So what is it? So, is he dead or what? I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon? Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull? Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat. Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat. So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up. No shit? What? Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute. No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here. I got 'em, all right? I got the diamonds. Nope. Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they? What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em. At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back. Did ya see what happened to anybody else? I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close - to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody. I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way. Could you believe Mr. Blonde? No real people? Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody? Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there. Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine. I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White? The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone. That's not correct. Why not? I'm cool. What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money! Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now. You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us. You haven't thought about this? This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time. Oh this is bad, this is so bad. Is it bad? Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die? Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown? Fuck all that. So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit. Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make. How do you know all this? It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did. Was he all pissed off? Where was she from, Compton? Elois? Who? You ain't dying, he is. No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of. Just hold on buddy boy. What? Snap out of it! When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco. Myself and Mr. Pink? Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue? Mr. Brown? Let's go over it. Where are you? Jesus Christ! What for? Don't ask me that. Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this! Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next! That's your proof? Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that. Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong. What the fuck are you talking about? What's the cut, poppa? No, they're not. How many employees? Bad luck. What's the exposure like? He's doin' twenty years in Susanville. Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice. She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram. Sorry, it's my book now. Who gives a damn? Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it. You gonna put it away? When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot. For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left. I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave. Give me this fucking thing. What's that? That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage? He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery. What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him. Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard. Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say? You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place? For what, the cops? Why? Follow you where? What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it? You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you. That fuckin' shooting spree in the store. What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot! We think we got a rat in the house. Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize. Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho. What happened? Lie back down, and try to - I can' take you to a hospital. It's not good... You're not gonna fucking die, all right? I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya. Bet your sweet ass we are. Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for? Correct. Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay! Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor? Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying. Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss... Not these guys. Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit? There's a slight difference. This is what he was doin'. What are you gonna do about him? You takin' his side? You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out. So you wanna git bit, huh? This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us. Is that supposed to be funny? Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip. You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot! That fuckin did it! If we don't, he'll die. If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round. Of course. Don't fuckin' patronize me. We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't. He asked. I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation. I told him my first name, and where I'm from. Well, he knows a little about me. I don't know anybody. Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here. Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him. So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain. Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die. He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital. I think he's just passed out. He ain't dead. Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right. That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat. For all I know, you're the rat. I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit. Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it. Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop. I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed. That was the plan, we meet here. Where? Are they out in the car? Where? How can you be so sure? You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a - Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole. What do you think? Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down. What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one? That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy? That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that? Uh-uh, just cops. A few cops. You're right, this is bad. How did you get out? Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit - As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops. What's wrong with it? Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the - Want a smoke? Splash some water on your face. Take a breather. What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool? Let's go in the other room... I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him. You really think we were set up? As opposed to good? How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him. Dead. Gun shot. Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips. You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard - I'd go over twelve percent for that. I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip? You don't believe in tipping? Whaddaya mean you don't tip? C'mon, throw in a buck. When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy. Can you believe the songs they been playin'? Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?I don't wanna lift crates. I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew. He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. Seymour Scagnetti. I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound. Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew. You fuckin' wish. No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! " I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself. Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about. Fine, now. That's great, guy, thanks a bunch. When do you think you'll need me for real work? Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again. I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot. I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside. Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house. A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti. Sure. It's a change.Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag? Rug samples. Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me. Yeah. Don't get too attached. Hey.The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here? A murder. On the reservation. Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like. Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here. -- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key? Your good friend Leo Fast Elk. James Looks Twice? Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent. It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit. Sioux Indian, right? Oh, yeah -- right. What the hell you doing?! Goodbye. -- did you understand me when I said that -- Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot. Good. Thank you. What journey? No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh... Ray... Little Weasel. You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet. I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you? Who are you? Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name? Taking ol' Leo somewhere? Ray... Come on, Ray. Come forward. No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here! We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over. This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ -- -- what the hell is Red Deer Table? You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister. Cuz I want New York. Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta. -- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go! Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it! Jesus, you alright? The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn. Tread matches. It's the car. Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't -- She's that subtle? He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer. Bastards... And get rid of the dog. I'll sleep around a little. Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar. Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised. Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray... You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me. Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van -- Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house. The right man? Talk to me, Ray. A long way from home. You be careful out there. Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian. Her oil pan is shot. Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support. That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver. Let's see it. What'd she say? Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker. Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat. That's right. One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization. Meet me at base. Over. I've got the doer. I know who he is. I got one up on ya. Maisy Blue Legs place? Good. Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars. No. That's Ray here. Ray... Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something? I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment. We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on -- Who the fuck is he? Check him out, Ray. Ray. That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away. No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you? Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"? Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns. That's scary shit. The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here. Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently. Seven. No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony. Has to be kept for four days. -- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that. Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when -- You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands. -- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that. Tell him, Ray. Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey. We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah? I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation. I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation. It ain't Geronimo. Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial. If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here. You didn't have another vision... You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time. That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance. They got us sealed. What are we gonna do? He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him. Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die. Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon... Ray. Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray... I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything. Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing. Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man. So they took care of Leo. We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water. What? Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry. Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure. Stop. Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones. Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams? I'm a full-blood Oglala. You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision. Nothin'. Forget it. Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you? You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty. Where was this? Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when. Why? So you can get rid of me, too? You got Jimmy. Let her go. Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her. Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle... You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop? I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's. Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow? Still after Jimmy? You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case. Not no more. Cuz I'm a skin? You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered. Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination. Likewise. You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian. What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths. What you call myths, we call our history. What'd you expect to hear? Ray -- Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision. Red Deer Table, Ray. A what? Grandpa traded with me. Goodbye. Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late. You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu. The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car. Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain. So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't -- Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister. Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you. Go back to your DNA finger-printin'. He also said "listen to the water." The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo. He saw an owl. The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week. Why should I tell you. He said he doesn't know. Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament. He says he saw you in a vision some time ago. But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you. He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster. Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco? Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine. He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information. They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you. You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on. Easy. Easy... I'm goin'. To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them. I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs. Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is -- You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter. No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long. No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth. -- Well, maybe two-seventeen. Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen -- -- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire. You're steppin' on sign. Watch out! I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is. Again. Figures, man. FBI? What you investigatin'? Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man -- What's this about? That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating. What are you doing?Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over. What are you doing on the reservation? Ray. What's your 20? They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room. Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down. Ray. X22. Come back? Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over. Go ahead, Ray. X21, give me a 20.Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you. We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl. Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples. Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones. You're my hero, Carl. Hey. Nice tie. They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation. Mr. Clear Moon. Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set. I see. I thought we were staying on the reservation. Let the press through. No way, Cooch. We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it? -- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go... What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch. You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table -- Why? Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear -- Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I -- And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river. Yes. -- Cooch. Woh. Stop. Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says. It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass." All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home. Thanks, Cooch. Alright. Alright... I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer. I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed. -- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of -- When did we get that? Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck. Cooch. Where the fuck did they send us? Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty? Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant? I gave it back to her. She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's. She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty. Alright. Alright. I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down. They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement. White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol. Who is he? Cooch. You're my hero. Go ahead. How'd you know? Couldn't sleep. I already did. Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think. Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure. Beats the hell outta me. Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork. Leo has to take the journey, Cooch. -- a fucking cop. I did. This is a restricted area. Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure. Six rounds. 357. You crashed my file? Were you in Nam? Jesus... I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six. South Dakota... Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir? You take care. I'll have to see what the visions say about that one. Some Indian time? What about the water... We're in there. We're in there -- We're going for The Stronghold. He's gone. Bullshit, let's get outta here, I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead. You go to the council fire. I'm going back in. He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight. What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird. This Clear Moon's house? Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again. Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved. That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium. 1868... Jesus. Oil? What's that? What the hell do you want me to do?! Yeah. Fitful dreams. We've driven a long way. Where is this place? Sorry. What do you mean? Well, it was just a dream, I -- At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why? Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo. Do they come in dreams, these visions? No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go. Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me. Nowhere. I'm trying to find her. Crow Horse, listen -- No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop. Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is. They found prints at Blue Legs' place. And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you. What are you talking about? Cuz you're a cop. Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man. Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing? Take care of yourself, Walter. I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here. It's not real. Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic. -- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man. Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation? Don't tell me: heavy duty. I can't do that, It's a Rolex. Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing. The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo? That's not solid. I don't see the connection. -- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold. Electromagnetic printing. She's your sister? I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance. Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster. The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court? So what? And... Because he was talking to me. What was he saying? He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say? What did he say? What's he smoke in that? He knows me? What did he say? Why does he wanna see me? Medicine. As in medicine man? Let's go. Is that right? What are the trees saying today? Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security. His spiritual mother... -- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota. Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here. You've got no jurisdiction. Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area. You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track? Bullshit. Hey. Hey, you, listen up -- What?! What are you -- After we've completed our investigation. Great. What? NO. My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy. I desecrated it? You burned an American flag today. And left it for me... Move it, Magdelana. When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay? Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world. A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine. Who did? He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he? Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes? This Jimmy's? That's right. Turn around. Yellow bird... is gonna sing. I'm on my way back in. Over. X21. Come back. Good. I read, Cooch. Never mind. No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that? I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over. X22. Read. Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location. Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But -- I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and -- I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think -- No. No, no. Thank you. Mister Tully. Keep talking, Yellow Bird... What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English! Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?! You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows. The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them. How the hell do you know? Leo Fast Elk... is alive. They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth. Get up! Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard. Get up out of the chair, Richard. Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver. Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard? No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here? Leavenworth a tough joint? At Sioux Falls Pen? Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more. Red Deer Table! What's with you, man? I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever. What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn. Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there? I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary? No way. No fuckin' way. What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do. They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right? I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you! What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man. What the fuck you talkin' about? Washington sent ya. I know that. You ever try solitary confinement? No, that was Leavenworth. This -- was Sioux Falls. What ya want? Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know. What ya want?You're describing half the high school girls in America. What is she doing right now? Tell me some other things about her. What color hair will she have? Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman? You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder? Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper? Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?I want you to kill for me. I want you to kill for me. I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth. That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting. SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA? I want you. I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.Bobby's got it. We can do it right here. Why? Why not? Where are you goin'? Let's ditch this place and party. Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back. Don't get funny with me again. No shit... We killed a guy for baby laxative. The stuff we got last night. Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative. Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box... It's ten thousand dollars. This isn't Mike. Is this Mike? Here he comes. Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00. It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight. This will tide you over. Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there. I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH? Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel. We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring. Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things. What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere. It's 4:30. We close at five. Out back in our morgue. A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end. You're lucky I am not wasting you. Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"Yep, it sure is. Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts. An old woman and her grandson. A trailer was here. What the hell do you think? God damn, you people are confusing. Well, where are you going? That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you. GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer... After that I never saw him again. That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline. Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls. That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here. No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now. Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they? Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off. Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago. More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse. GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.You try that you little monkey. Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question. You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses. Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that? Oh.GOOD LUCK, CHET. SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI. YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY. YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL. I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT. GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE. OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS. NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET. CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON. ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL? ALBERT? QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW? ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK. HE'S GONE. COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY. COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.She is preparing a great abundance of food. She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help. Blonde. A woman. Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it. Albert. The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert. Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle? Can you tell me what their names were? Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer? What was here, Mr. Rodd? I am going over here. I am not going to Cliff's trailer. Thank you, Carl. It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again. Teresa Banks. What? Phillip? What is it, Gordon? And no one found the ring? Tell me about the letter. Stanley, I heard all about it. And neither will I. I'm up to speed, Stanley. Anything else? Where am I? And how can I leave? That would indicate that it's the future. Where is the ring?Sam, get the body and put it in the van. Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered? Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it? We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it. We've got our own clock. We'll lock up. That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body? Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased. Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government. I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks. Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up. Is there a golf course around here? You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend. Yes they do. Did she have visitors? Was there an argument? Did she have someone with her? Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please. I think I'll take off my badge as well. No you couldn't. Did you know Teresa Banks? Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered? What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy? Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now. Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch. Congratulations. I heard about that. Smell something fishy, huh? Okay, Gordon!!! OK, Gordon. OK, Gordon. Yes... Did she ever mention any friends? Ever see her with someone else? Any friends? I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks Sorry to hear it. Where's Hap? Thanks. What do you mean? Thanks. He's with me. Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out? Do you take cocaine, Irene? Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine? What happened to her? Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well? Say no more. How come Jack let's you work here? Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail. Faulty wiring. I don't take it, Sam. I give it. He's not the murderer. But he's a bozo. My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway. Take a look at this. You better dust this place, Sam. She must have known someone. No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say. I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park. I think that's a good idea. It's late, Sam. We're not. You and I are going to get some food. What is it? Accidental? Oh. Cole said she was 17. Sure, but let's finish up with this first. I don't know, Sam. That's good. That's what I heard. Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation. He talks loud. And he loves his code. What? That's just Gordon's bad taste. Very good, but I can't tell you about that. Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it? Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress? Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison. Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI. Lil was wearing a sour face. I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance? We're heading into a difficult situation. Sort of shorthand. Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.Brother, I hear you talkin'. I did? I didn't see anything. Nice night. You got it. What'll it be? You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm. Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.I'm so sorry, Laura. What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love. But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside. Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob. Poor Laura. I wish I could help you. No... No... What does Bob say? Maybe. But Bob isn't real. Who would do that?No. Ask Irene over there. No. No. Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it. He didn't suffer. He's dead -- good and dead. Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.Send me a kiss. Laura, you have to deal with all of this. Did you make me a tape? A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with. Laura, you didn't come and see me today.We're on our way, Baby. Right on time, baby. But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches... I think Bobby was arranging something for you... Speaking of arrangements... SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS... Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town... Thursday. That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like... And what a muffin you have. No "Jacques". I am the Great Went. Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.See what? What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody. What? What? Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you. You always hurt the ones you love. Oh, Laura. What is wrong with us?... We have everything. What do you mean? What the hell is wrong with you? What's going on? What about tonight? This afternoon? I've got to see you. When am I going to see you? You're on somethin' again, aren't you? We were supposed to be together. Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up. You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth. It does matter. We're in love. Why? It does. Laura, do you love me? Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette. Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees. You're getting warmer. You'd think so. No. No. Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk. Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?They were looking for wood. Trees? Sex? Eating? Hiking? Boating? I always thought you knew it was me. DON'T MAKE ME DO IT. Laura. What's wrong this morning? You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house. Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you? No. Yes. Yes. Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to? We're late to get to your mother. No, you haven't met him. Have you met him? A special friend? Who was that? Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail. Let me see. Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry? School? Hi, honey, how's Donna? The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer". Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer. Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands. How do you know what she doesn't like? Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new? Bobby didn't give you this? Did you get this from your lover? Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner. And look at this. Look at this finger here. This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first. Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe? "I'm hungry". Nothing, I chickened out. That's right. Who am I? Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?What did you say? I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it. That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY. Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface. WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY. Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.You are here and there is no place to go... The later events have never been kept a secret. Someone else has it now.Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain. Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle. You missed somethin', Ed. Yep... Yes... It is. I haven't got it yet. Fill 'er up. Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here. No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.No, sir, we did not. Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail. No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this. I cracked the Whiteman case with this. Oh, alright. You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O. Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant. Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil? Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles. We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose? Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond? I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me. One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring? When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond? Yes, he is like a clown. I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond? May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond? There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring. She's wearing a ring. I'll get my kit. She lived alone. In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park. Are you speaking to me in a code? I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland. It's not late, it's early. Really early. Agent Desmond, it's... Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond? Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep? It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look. Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there. There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand. Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age. Maybe, later we could take a look. Yes, it is good. What do you think is in these other drawers? No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this. Solved the Whiteman Case with this. It must be a high priority situation. I see. He does talk loud. Why couldn't he have just told you all these things? What did Gordon's tie mean? A blue rose. The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight. So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime. Oh, the uncle is missing. What do you mean? How do you figure? Shorthand. Really? Code, I've heard a lot about this. That was really something. That dancing girl. What did it mean?We throw away the whole head. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head. I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes. Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye. Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes. What are you afraid of? What people think? Josie, I think we should go public.I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock. You're out of control, Curran. Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi. There's no smoking in this building. When did you start drinking again? Were you drinking? All night? Where were you tonight? Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it? I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here. The boat blew. There was a leak in the gas line. There were two previous repairs. There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em. A real heavy investigation. Zilch. Goose-egg. It was an accident. You're on leave, man. You're on psycho leave. I'm talking to a possible whacko here. Take care, you hear? We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing. A professor. Icepick. In his bed. Multiple stab wounds. 1977.Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell? Did you ever tie him up? Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him? Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz? There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell. I'm John Corrigan. I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms. Tramell. Can we get you anything? Would you like some coffee?I hope I helped you out. Nope. She did. Like I say. It never panned. The usual -- a girlfriend. Nope. There was some talk; it never panned. That's him. Nope, can't say that I do. Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine. I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question. What's this about anyway? No suspects, no motive. Unsolved. .38 revolver. Never recovered. He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic. Somebody drove by and shot him.That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady? What kind of drugs? Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell? I like that. "Suspension of Disbelief." How's that? It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time. You workin' on another book? You have the right to an attorney. Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you -- He was murdered. She said alone -- suite 405. It ain't gonna take long. Where the hell you goin'? You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got. You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after? Oh, man. Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes. There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened. She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is. How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened? If she's telling you the truth. So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what. You don't know what the hell was in it? Which one you talkin' about now, son? We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain. Ain't that hard, son. This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em. Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present. She used Daddy's razor. Why not? You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends? She's right. You got an icepick in you yet? You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car? I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car. In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no. I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch. Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else. How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle. That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger. He winks at her. The woman looks away from him, shaking her head. Why the hell not? I feel fine! Say what? What in the hell for? You think I'm gettin' any at my age? I don't like blue-haired women. I don't like 'em. I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS! You... fucked her! Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch -- I went over last night, too. Everybody that she plays with dies. Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass? Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that. I don't son, but I got the minority opinion. Somethin', though. What is it you got between you? You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that. No, sir. You won't. There's smoke off yonder on the horizon. They're gonna want your badge. What's goin' down, son? Hell yes! Couldn't get it outta my head for years. Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems. One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em. All of 'em. Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it. Sweet as honey. Said she didn't know why she done it. No, sir. They never even got a statement from her. I came in here to jack off the damn machine. One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what? He was her counselor. Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine? What you doin', son? Hallelujah. How'd it go, son? I'm a smart sonofabitch. I just hide it. Ain't that cute? They got his and her Pig-assos, son. They're executives. They're nervous about everything. Not now he don't. I never heard of him. Who was this fuckin' guy? You're already gettin' psychological input, son. He looks a little shrunk, that's all. He ain't that way. He's got heart. Maybe it's for old-time's sake. Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch. Maybe the maid did it. What was the motive? Were you with him last night? When was the last time you saw John Boz? Homicide.Go stick your head in a tub of ice water. See where she leads. You look like dogshit. Yeah. I know. Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs. Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face. Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it. She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds. I told you to stay away from Tramell. You knew her, didn't you? Don't fuck with me, Nick. I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling. You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way -- Tell me again. I want to hear you say it again. First you've got her buying your file. Now you've got her killing Nilsen. Forget her, willya? Go someplace. Sit in the sun. Get away from this goddamn fog. Get her out of your system. Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people? I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen. They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation. I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him? Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published. Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything. I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus. Fuck you, too Nick. How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too? Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written. What are you -- a book critic? How the fuck do you know? What is it with you and this broad anyway? What now what? Now nothing. She passed the polygraph. That's it. You sure? And you volunteered. What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride. We bring her in for questioning. You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer. She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about? Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased -- I said keep it. Keep your three o'clock. He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight. That's the last time anybody saw him. Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook. She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility. Catherine Tramell. Age 30. No priors, no convictions. Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980. Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir. Estimated assets $110 million. She's a suspect.Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time? Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him? I'd have to be really dumb to do that. What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking? A couple days ago. Yeah, I was drinking. Yeah. Home. Watching TV. No. Okay. I went after him. I lost my temper. Bring 1976 up. It's not gonna take long, Sam. Thanks. You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find? Did you find out about her parents? She was there, wasn't she? Don't! I know about your husband. You still like girls, Beth? Put your fucking hands up! Don't move. Put your hands up! You should do something about this lock. Why did you change your name? She didn't hand you to me. She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson. You saw all the reports, Beth! Did you know Noah Goldstein? What did she tell me, Beth? Tell me about Catherine. I thought you hardly know her. What is this interest you've got in her? I don't need any help. Beth. I didn't mean what I said. About -- What was she like in school? She knows stuff about me that only you know. No. I mean it, thank you. You did it for me. Yeah? Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out. But take my advice. Put a little more life into it than you usually do. I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything. We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times? It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations. Who? It's Internal Affairs, isn't it? Don't, Beth. Don't lie to me. Who's got access to my goddamn file? I need a cigarette. Why didn't you tell me? She said what you said she'd say. Who? What else is new? What are you doing here? Yeah. Thank you. It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here? No! I'm working my tail off. I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore. No. It's been three months. My sex life is fine. My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again. Things are fine. I told you. They're fine. It's bullshit. You know it is. I'm fine. Come on, Beth! You know I'm fine! How the hell long do I have to keep doing this? We fuck like minks. We forget the rugrats. We live happily ever after. We fuck like minks. We raise rugrats. We live happily ever after. What is this -- some kind of... Joke? Are we playing games again? How did it end? Why? Why not? They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after. A detective. He falls for the wrong girl. I'm writing a book. No thanks. I have to do some research tomorrow. No. You didn't not see me long enough to miss me. How'd you get in here? No. I did, too. She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did. I found Lisa Henderson. You like to hang out with murderers or what? Did you know Roxy -- Can I talk to you a minute? He asked if I had an icepick in me yet. I don't know. What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character? You paid $50,000 for your character? Why? When? Try me. No? I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets. Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too. Do you think she killed Johnny Boz? It's OK. It's OK. No. Did you like her to watch? I know. I don't have a choice. I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty. Are you kidding? You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation? It hurts. How's your shoulder? How about Roxy? Is she a fuck to the century, too? What did you think? I told her it was the fuck of the century. Maybe she saw something she didn't see before. I'll meet you there. How's your new book? To see if I can get away with it. I'll risk it. No. Yes. When did you write it? Why does he do it? What's it about? What do you want from me, Catherine? There's Pepsi in the fridge. What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you? My wife used to call me that. What if I asked you not to call me Shooter? What did you pay Nilsen? Ice? Jack Daniel's okay? It's gonna have to be. You can make a mistake. Don't get too cocky. Yeah. Would you like to come up and have a drink? I like you. I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend. How exactly did you hear? I didn't. No. Didn't you study it in school? She wiped out her whole family. You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins? Tell me about Professor Goldstein. They were drug buys. I was a vice cop. It was an accident. They got in the line of fire. You tell me. I'd like to ask you a few more questions. No, thanks. Am I... disturbing you? I don't know anything that isn't police business. How do you know all this stuff about me? I passed. Why not? It's got to be tiring to beat that machine. Sure. Even though you were fucking him. Because you didn't love him -- But you didn't hurt -- How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach. How did you feel when he died? You like playing games, don't you? Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him. But you said you liked men to use their hands. I told them you wouldn't want to hide. I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present. What's your new book about? I told you -- I quit. I thought you were out of cigarettes. I quit. I don't smoke. Do you always keep old newspapers around? If that's the way you want to play it. Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us. Was there anyone with you last night? Did you go home with him? Did you leave the club with him? Were you with him last night? How long were you having sex with him? How long were you dating him? I'm De... You did. Thanks. He had a girlfriend? What kind of talk? Was she ever a suspect? Nilsen? Do you remember his name? Routine. Was his wife ever a suspect? Were there ever any suspects? What was the weapon? I'm going with you. I know what happened. Catherine told me what happened. She's a writer -- it's part of what she does. He was I.A. He probably asked her about it. Don't you get it, Gus? If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley. It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen. Catherine told me what was in it. I'm not sure anymore she did it. I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop. You're my friend, Gus. I don't believe it. Catherine says you don't like her. Come on, I'll drive you in this thing. You all right, pop? You want me to drive you? It doesn't make sense. She didn't know me three months ago. I don't know. I'm just not. I'm not afraid of her. You feeling better? You don't like punk rockers? You oughta use a rubber, pop. You really should. I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it. I always use a rubber. I wasn't there last night, either. Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there. I know what that's like. She want to play? Fine. I can play. I don't think it's funny. You think I -- I don't know. She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me. I got tired of being played with. Nothin' I'll be okay, pop. Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins? Was she ever suspect? What are you doing here, Pop? It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop? She doesn't know me. I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her. She misses me. I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus. Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about? Before your time, pop. Mid-sixties. Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now. Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz. Yeah. But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car. Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house. All we did was write her name down. I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you? It was an accident. You don't but it, do you? She knew nobody would but it. She knew I'd say she did it. And she knew nobody would buy it. Catherine Tramell. It's part of her game. She killed him. No. What about me? Fuck you, Phil. How did they die? Was there an investigation? Come on, Phil. You're not gonna let this slide. What about her parents? What about what else she's published? At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence. She knew she could beat it. That's why she asked to take it. Now what? I'm sure. She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody. So what do we do -- nothing? I love it. She's got a hundred million bucks. She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars. And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads. Are you kidding me? Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to -- What was it? He was shot. Can there be some mistake? Can you check again? Did you check all four years? How old was she when this happened? Who are you? Why do you think he's dead? We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell. It's yours. She's got enough money to burn this whole department down. On what basis?Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne. Yes, I suppose that we did. Ah. "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"? Mr. Wayne ... a reminder: Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck. May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative? I think I'll take the stairs. I will relay the message. Which is why I hoped you'd snub him. I suppose you feel better now, sir. It's vichyssoise, sir. Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?Wrong on both counts. First you're gonna shut up. Then you're gonna turn yourself in. I tried to grab you -- save you -- A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ... We do. ...four, five. I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up. One ... A "he-man"? Sure. They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of. Hanging on every word. I'm -- sorry, I -- "Shreck's." You -- Maybe you're right. Things change. What're you really after? Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good. You're not the Mayor. Admiring your handiwork?Right. Sure. And "Peace on earth, good will toward men." I guess this mean we won. You'll never guess. I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ... "Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ... Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh? Funny, but sort of mysterious... Alright, thanks. 'Fraid I can't. There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but -- Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza. You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show. No, actually I feel worse. Vichyssoise. Supposed to be cold, right? It's cold. No, nothing, ah ... His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them. I don't know. Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing. But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it. Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge or the jury... I mean, just who do you think you are ? Same here. So why'd you come tonight? Y'mean take off our costumes? No hard feelings? Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and -- What're you doing three dates from now? I, ah ... never fool around on the first date. Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion. If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you. Photojournalist. Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because I had trouble reconciling them. Vicki said. Nope, I told her everything. Had one. Didn't work. Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose. ... and me. No, that's be me and me. Is that what I said? ... Maybe I'll watch it on TV. Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean... You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle. You almost sound enthusiastic. I wouldn't be caught dead. No, it's probably how I would be caught. The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait -- And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"? The guy probably prevented millions in property damage. I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck. Selina. Hi. Didn't mean to -- I, ah ... didn't catch your last name. I'm tempted. Well, I could ... free up some time... No. And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him. Didn't I say that? Sorry. I mistook me for somebody else. We've met. It does to me. Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City. What happened? "Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang. I can't prove it but we both know it's true. Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting... I'm not scared of you, Max. Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here. So -- Good time, too. Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'. No. No glass on the inside. Hmm. Primitive ventilation.You buy this "blurry" business? PMS. She jumped. She'd been depressed. Dad! Save yourself!Yawn. I am the light of this city. And I am its mean, twisted soul. Does it really matter who's the "mayor"? Ingenious costume. Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody? Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope? Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back? Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office. If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to -- Scared of Oswald, are you? Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school! Mayors come and go. And heirs tire easily. Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck. If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning. I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time. Weird, huh? Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows -- One way to find out? Was. Selina! Selina Kyle!? You're fired! And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman? Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me. Let's make a deal. Other than my blood, what can I off-- My blood? I ... I gave at the office. I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss. Money, jewels, a very big ball of string... Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage? Bottom line: she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window. Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry. Yeah -- Oswald, please. Yes. Yes . Boyfriend trouble ..? I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out -- Son! I'm the one you want! Penguin, please! Ask yourself: Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you? Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage? Not Chip! Please! Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead. I think you'd feel out of place at my party. You see, it's for winners. Point is, listen to them. They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future. If it works, don't fix it... Imagine: You'll have the ear of the media. Access to captains of industry. Unlimited poon- tang ... Sidetracked? Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ... Precisely. But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided. That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state. That's fine, Oswald. But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin. Oswald: We need one more thing. We need signatures. To overturn the ballot. I can supply those, Oswald. Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows I know. But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic! Don't look, Oswald. It's a surprise. You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you. And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ... Fred. Fred? He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and -- If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded. Yawn. That coulda come from anywhere. And exactly why am I gonna help you ? Well it's not working. What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me? My god ... it's true. The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h-- I damn well better be. In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them -- Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne. Selina?! Selina ... Selina ... Actually, it's a lot like that. I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle. And Interest Number One, is moi . And a very, very good one. ... Where did curiosity get the cat? And who ... would you say this to ? Why, how industrious. And how did you open protected files, may I ask? Working late? I'm touched.I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask! Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask. But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..? Better than you know, Bat-boy. Things change. Hey, good to meet you. We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future. Touring the riot scene. Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff. The name is Oswald Cobblepot. I oughta have you spayed! You sent out all the signals! Let's consummate our fiendish union! Well, a plan is forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ... Thanks. Jeez. Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number. Y'mean frame him? We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels. Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor. Oh, him again. He's already history -- check it out. Are you perchance a registered voter? I'm also a mayoral prospect. Huh? You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal? Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma? I'll warm ya! I got hot mitts --! But who could've ... no, don't say it. Silent night, violent night... The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- ! Okay, you have a point. Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves. I don't. So, no. You're coming with me, you Great White Dope! To die, way down in the sewer! Max! Relax! Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this. We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par-- He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control .. Reclaim my birthright, y'mean? I got my own ... quest to pursue up here. It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ... ... Want 'em to go apeshit. Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies. Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ... Sounds fun. But I ... "You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot." "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot." "I need you, Oswald. I need you now. That's the biggest parasol I ever --" A platform? Lemme see ... Stop global warming. Start global cooling. Make the world a colder place. Frigid ... I could teach her my "French flipper" trick... Wonder if it's worth my time. Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time? Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ... A big bag of fan mail? Filthy lucre? Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad? You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck. A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner? What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham? Most of all, I want to find out who I am. By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name. Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted. No, just give you a splitting headache. Quiet, Max. What do you think, this is a conversation? Actually this is all just a bad dream. You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.Let's move out! Whoa! Whoa! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now. Coach knows what abs are? ... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow. You going? Litter, yeah! I like it. Can I be your friend? Buffy, this is crazy. What do these guys want? Buffy! Looking tasty. Absolutely. I see now the error of my mistake. Man has a complex. Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?I'm hungry. Let me in, Pike! I'm hungry! The sun! It burns! It burns! I... feel.... pretty. I'm fine. Invite me in, Pike. Let me in. Utterly. Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know. Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches. When you get your car together, man, let's bail. I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you. Yes. Definitely. Definitely. Please, God. They're all the same! They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human. I hate them. Rich bitches. They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped. Hey! She wasted my dog! You're the guys from the movie! Figures. Amazing! That's it, man. That's the whole story. Oh, yeah. But I still want to know what happens. Suck!Down there. My bike! She's a lesbian, too. She told me. Yeah, I saw her. Bitch took my wheels. You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?Yes! Nice to feel needed. What's with you? I don't know. Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.' Well, um... litter? Stay away from my thang. Sorry, honey. 'Thing.' I'm out of here. Jenny. You weren't home. Like always. Didn't you get my message? Oh, come on, Buffy. You know what's going on. It's not working out at all. I've got to move on. I mean, I've got needs, too. I told you about all this. I'm here with Jenny. Buffy, what are you doing here? So that's your tutor, huh? What is he, like, your boyfriend now? So I noticed. I can't get sick. You know -- training and all. I'm gonna be late. Where were you last night? I called your house like four times. Hey, baby, how ya doing? You look beat. Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight? Hey there. Come on, what was it? What'd you dream about? You were having a nightmare. I just want to see the basketball scores. It's important. It's the news, Buffy. Hey, it works for me. If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable... Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh. You okay? I heard she got straight A's. Okay, let's go. Well, I'm done. Are you done? Buffy? Oh, baby! Write that down.You are much more. But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers. Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called. Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan. He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth. They are a plague upon us. The mark of the Coven. She has died. You are the next to be called. Why do you think you were sent to me? Trained as you were? You bear the mark. You know you must. There is only one. Now you are that one. It is time.Which way did she go? Wheels? Yes. Did you see a girl come by here? Wait! None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble. Football is my life. Oh, I'll be there all right. I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready. All right. Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it. Your fate. Another distraction. It's not right. There isn't time. Interesting. I want to die. My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable. But it's in the back. Why are we wasting time with this, anyway? I can't work this. Vampires of the world, beware. As for example, what? Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend. It interferes with the work, and it... It isn't important. There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge... ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born. My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs. There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies. I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger... I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this. It's what I was raised to do. There aren't many of us left, the Watchers. Not if you're careful. Five. What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer? Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers? Five. Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart. Do you want to live? Do you? What do you want? Encouragement? 'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.' Buffy... Don't start with me again. A what? You'll get used to it. I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes. It's natural. A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it. It's part of how you are able to track them. You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps. And the alley was a mistake. Never corner yourself like that. If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now. One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten. He was slow. Very simple. They won't all be that easy. Try to pay attention. Same one. All right. You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps? Or Jack the Ripper? Good Lord. What do you study in history? Oh, several. Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar? No. No bats, no flying. They... float, occasionally. Not really flying. Your turn. Exactly. You're changing. You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful. Two days ago, would you have even hit me? Let alone so powerfully? Don't you see what's happening? You're changing. You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of. God, this hurts. I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working. I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process. I don't think you understand the full implications of -- It was necessary. And you caught it! Only the chosen one could have done that. I had to test you. Oh. Good. Oh. I thought... you lead me -- Who we gonna beat? Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer. All right. Why don't you show me a cheer? Cheerleading. For... sporting events, yes? But you enjoyed it, yes? Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped. Why? I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you. What your strengths are, your likes... Everything. What's your best subject? We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out. For your parents. In a way, yes. Your fate is inexorably connected to them. We'll cover it later. Yes. They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork. The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own. You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated. Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy. But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention. Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos. Do you know what a Vampire-King is? There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start There's so little time. It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes. It's true. Skip it. Meet me at this address after school. Go to school tomorrow. Try to act normal. Don't let anyone know what's happening. This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore. Where's the other one? We wait for Robert to wake up. Just for protection. You won't have to do anything. I just need you to watch. This is it. Cramps? Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams? I have to show you. Lothos. China. In Virginia. In the past. A girl. Maybe... A Magyar peasant. An Indian princess. A slave. Did you ever dream that you were someone else? I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof. You bear the mark. Yes. To stop the killing. To stop the vampires. You must believe me. You must come with me while there's still time. You don't understand. You have been chosen. Wait! You must come with me. It's much too late already. You must come with me to the graveyard. To bring you... your birthright. I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy. Not at all. My name is Merrick. I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were... complications. You should have been taught, prepared. I'm looking for you, actually. I'm sorry. That was impressive. The... tumbling.I mean it. Get away from here. No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty. Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something. You look like shit, Benny. Wait a minute. What's wrong with you, man? Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt -- Benny, man, where you been? You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix! Our own world, where we could live and grow beans. Hundreds of beans. You think? Split? Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me. Well, there it is, isn't it? You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them. What's that all about? Would you sleep with them? You didn't like them. Bummer metaphor. We hate you guys! Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?' I'm just wondering. It's coffee. We're looking at a dog, possible coffee... Come on, come on, fork up the scub. No, we didn't. Wrong answer! No prize. Booo! You're the boss, boss. I just thought maybe we should wait. Who's afraid? Besides me, I mean. I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off. We could maybe wait till later. Are you okay? Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone. You say that like it's a bad thing. Are you nuts, Buffy? There's a hundred of them out there. They'll rip us apart. Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance? Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time. That's me. I crashed your party. Benny was right. You guys are all exactly the same. I should have known. But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy. Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry... You got that right. I thought you wanted to kill vampires. I don't believe this. The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer? What for? Second word... sound like 'dance'. Come again? Dress, huh? What for? Cool. I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches. What do you need? I been working on some stuff for you. What'cha doing? Who? Buffy? What's wrong? I think I could help. You gonna tell me you don't need help? Besides, Oxnard sucks. I don't know. I kind of thought I ought to be here. You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from. I know. You know, you saved my life. And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost. Hey, Buffy... Oh, I'll be fine. Got my chair, got my window, I'm great. I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything. No, you're not. I know. My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead. I'll back that up. Hey, jeez are you okay? You need a hand? Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard. Thanks. Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus. I'm gone. Yeah, I was bailing. I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess. Bad scene. God! Unbelievable. Vampires. They were vampires, weren't they? Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby? Water. Okay. Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Kind of miss my knees, though. It was. I think it's pretty much ready for the -- Hi there. Yeah, we're drunk. We're the Drunks. What's your name? Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe? Will you guys shut up, please? You want some punch? Hey, wait a minute... I'm sorry. I'm Pike. This is Benny. The don't. You kind of wish they would, though. Run. I am. I don't think so. You should think about leaving, too, man. Sell this place... Something's going on here. I don't know. Something real weird. Hey, have you seen Benny lately? I'm leaving, man. I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.Got that. Could be. Could be. Hi, Grueller.Hey. What should I do if I see Benny? All right. Take care of yourself. Ah, you'll be coming back. No... You want me to give him a message? Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money? What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?Whatever you say. When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed. You could always make it up to her. She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself. Who knows the secrets of the human heart. He's what she should run a mile from. It takes all types. So let's call this the usual. Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that. So can we consider you a regular, sir? Scottish? Yeah. Fuck it, Dil. Saw it, Dil. Stop it, Dil -- Hi. Ask him yourself. I would expect he does. An excellent quality. Persistent. That's what he said. Jimmy. I've no thoughts on the subject. He agreed that he was. She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair. Now, that was a look. Saw that one. Nice. Yeah? Did he? See what, Dil?No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I? Look, I'm sorry. Don't chuck my clothes out! Fucking mad! Don't throw my clothes out the window! Please, Dil -- It's Dave. Cunt. Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt. Cunt. It's him, isn't it? Who the fuck is he? Don't be like that -- You fucking did. You fucking promised. C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!Fucking men, Col -- Fuck it, is what I say. You see that, Col? No. Tell him to go fuck himself. Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much. He's back, Col Ask him. Maybe he wants something. Good thing in a man. He's still looking, Col. Hi, Jimmy. What do you think his name is? Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col. What would you call it? What you think? Just cut his hair, you know. He gave me a look. See that, Col? Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy? Fuck off, Dave. Take your fucking goldfish, too! Fuck off back to Essex! Take your clothes. Sure, Dave -- Hey, Stirling fucking Moss -- He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me? Charming. See, they get the wrong idea. Maybe. Jimmy. Thank you. You heard me -- Did I? Fuck off, Dave. What's that supposed to mean? Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why. Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - - I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy? I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left. Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement -- Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon -- Meet Col -- Where am I to go, Jimmy? Promise? Will I see you again? Am I in trouble, Jimmy? Do I? Tell me what she wore. And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she? I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too -- What happened to Jimmy? What's Fergus? What was that she called you, Jimmy? I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it. And you'll never leave me? Say it again. What would you do for me? You do? Then say it. Tell me you love me. Love me. More endearments. Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more. You like me now, Jimmy? Let them come then. Try and go, then. Why? See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet. Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever. See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours. Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look. Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too. You tried. You didn't. You killed my Jody It was you... You killed my Jody? Died... Yes. You knew my Jody? You knew my Jody? You knew which man? Don't go like that. Jimmy? I will be. Only in times of extreme stress. Prescription. For my condition. My pills... You mean that? No! Tell me everything, Jimmy. So tell me. No! I'm going home... Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy. Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me. I'm going home! Why are we going here, Jimmy? For you... Why? Sorry. What you doing? You like me better like this. So it's true, then? You want to make me look like him... You're no good at this, Jimmy. You promise? And you wouldn't leave me? You'd like me better that way, Jimmy? Why? A girl has to draw the line somewhere -- You want another haircut, baby? Afraid so. Anything. Do you like me even a little bit? What you doing, Jimmy? And you're not going to tell me more? She from Scotland too? She own you, Jimmy? Why shouldn't I be jealous? I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry. She's the thing you had to tell me. It's her, isn't it? You following me? What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong -- You gonna tell me why? Why, honey -- Okay. Not at all, honey. He'd bring me carnations. Delirious. Only if you kiss me. Don't be cruel. I miss you, Jimmy. Please, Jimmy. A little. Stop it, Jimmy. Are you pretending yet? Absolutely. You can always pretend. Probably. Sorry. All right, they do. Details, baby, details. Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings. Know what, honey? When? Ask to meet me again. Make it up to me, then. That's a start. I know that. Nothing's wise. Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy. Made me feel all funny inside. My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant. You mean that? Do you care, Jimmy? And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared. See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes. Never said a truer word. Apologies, my sweet. Sorry, darling. Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon. Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say. Where? Tell him it hurt -- Tell him to stop messing Dil around -- He looks after me. He's a gentleman too. Even now. All the time. Told you, I'm superstitious. Why? What you thinking of, hon? No, depends on nothing. The thing is, can you go the distance? Can't leave me now. I'm superstitious. Drink. Drink. Why? You mean that? What does that mean? So what do you want with me, Jimmy? He did sometimes. Is this an obsession of yours? I am. A real gentleman... But you can t stay, you know that? Like you're concerned. You say that like a gentleman. What do you think? Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool. That's good... Are you jealous of him? You want to know how I kissed him? No -- Yes. No. As different as it's possible to be. He was different. Tried to. Sit down, will you? Doesn't know the meaning of the word. Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace? Jesus fucking Christ. What'll it be? Would you like a drink? I'm not on my own, am I? Piss off, Dave! The things a girl has to put up with. Jesus. You want one? You got a special friend, Jimmy? Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes? Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it? I wonder. They're jealous. The one you gave me in the Metro. Give me that look again. Half-five. At Millie's. Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane. But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap. You want me to ask you in, right? You can't leave me then, can you? God no. I'm a hairdresser. You know. He wants me to perform for him. Yes, thank you. They all get the wrong idea. Hi. You old-fashioned? Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col? Everybody wants something. Jimmy? He's Scottish, Col. Don't know. Who is she? That should make her happy. Like treacle. The accent, I suppose. Scottish? Not English. You American? What's it to you? What's his name? Who? Someone recommend you? A girl has to have a bit of glamour. Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday. Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose. Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy? You know her, Jimmy? Carnations.She's not a girl, Col -- How? I'm sorry. Then why doesn't she? So who's he? Thanks. Is that good or bad? Yeah. It's a simple question. If I was her I'd consider that an insult. What? She's not that either. She's not a tart. Do you mean that? It's not Pat. It's Jim. As the man said, it's in my nature. Please, Dil -- Fergus. Thirty-five. Stop it, Dil -- Don't call me that -- Yes. Say hello to Col -- The Metro. I promise. You will, Dil Not if you go. Yes. Now. You've got to go now, Dil -- Can't remember... Yes. She was -- Dil!!! It's my name, Dil -- Fergus. Never. I'd do anything for you, Dil. Anything. Yeah. Love you, Dil. Whatever you say, Dil. Yes. I like you, DIl More what? I like you, Dil -- Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here Got to be somewhere. Let me go, Dil Stop it, Dil -- He asked me to see were you all right. Okay. Don't you want to kill me? I suppose I tried. No. In a manner of speaking. Did you hear me? I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died. Are you listening? Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days. Your soldier. Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man. What? Good-bye, Dil Are you all right, Dil? Are you supposed to take that many? What condition? What pills? You heard what I said, Dil? Yes. You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil. I was trying to get out of something. Come on... I had to go to work! Told you to stay in the hotel! Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here? Look on it like a honeymoon. For me. Don't call me that -- Yes. What? No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes... I'm sorry. I promise. No. Yes. It's a secret. Want to change you to a man, Dil... You said anything, Dil No. Sit down. You got the keys to the shop? You'd do anything for me? You do something for me, Dil? More than that. I'm not sure. I can't. You could say that. Yes. Shouldn't be, Dil Kind of. What's her? Dil, this is Jude. Not here. No. Come on. Come on. Don't. So I got it wrong, then. What? Happy now? Okay. Be a good girl and go inside. Should have stayed a girl. No. Can't pretend that much. Don't ask me in. Sorry. Am I becoming repetitious? There's Dave. He knew too. I'm working on it. Won't be quite the same though, will it? That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he? Kind of wish I didn't. I should have known, shouldn't I? Don't. So they do know. Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl. Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that. Do they know? Whenever. Tonight. Will you meet me again? How? So I'm sorry. Kind of liked you as a girl. I didn't mean to hit you. You think that's wise? I said stop it. Shut up. Yeah. I care, Dil. Sure I do. You could? Must be. You're something else, Dil, you know that? Give it over, Dil -- Don't call me that. What you doing here? Come on, Dil -- I have to talk to her, Col -- Dil -- No... Did he ever tell you you were beautiful? I'm wondering why you keep his things. I'm thinking of your man. Depends what it is. Aha. What is this? If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. Yeah. Something I heard someone say once. Want to look after you. Did he dance with you? Maybe. Did he come here too? Shouldn't you be in mourning? Didn't think I could. Do I? I think you do. Do you miss him? What would he think? Maybe. Yes... Did you do that to him? Shouldn't I go? Tell me about him. How different? He lived here with you? Must be in love to manage that. Someone out there. Whiskey. Yes, please. Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own? That Dave? Jesus Christ! How special? Must be. Like what? Why? What's that about? What look? Where? No, I didn't -- He's getting up. You on the game? Perform? What was that all about? You all right? What was that? Hi. You forgot your bag. Must be. Not me. Jimmy. Tell her I'm very happy with it. Who's she? And what's it like? How'd you guess? No. No. Nothing. Doesn't the water get to your nails? Guy I work with. In a way. Need to lose myself awhile. Need to go across the water. That's wise, Tommy. You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping? Dil! I take pride in my work. Who's the old geezer? Jude? You may be right. And what if you don't? And what happens then? Was I? And what if I say no? And then you'll leave her out of it? Of course. I forgot. But, then, I don't have a choice. She's nobody. She likes me. Leave her out of this. No way, Jude. I'm out. What do you mean? No, what is the thing? Yes. He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen. Suits you. I know. I heard. Leave me alone, Jude. He's hot. Leave us, Judie. Tough work, that. You don't know that. Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart. Poke him or something. See if he's still alive. Have a look at him. Did you give him it? Hey -- what's he like? See does he want some. Kind of suicide, isn't it? So it's on the street. Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in. Hope not. Thank God for that. Who is he? A hotel? Aye, I do, Peter. Just a girl. Definitely unusual. I understand. I know that. He's at home. I thought it was Dave. So it was you all the time. I'm sure. Would make me feel better about it. Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight -- Peter. I'm a volunteer, am n't I? Why? Yes. Back in a minute, Jody I told him. It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all. Thanks. He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like. And anyway, he's seen our faces. The poor whore's suffocating in the heat. Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy. Give him a cup of tea. Hurling -- Hurling -- I said you bastard -- stop -- You stupid bastard -- You won't run. Cricket's in the halfpenny place. The fastest. Stop that talk now -- Why? No. Me? No, I'm not good for much... Nothing. I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things... When I was a child... Like the one about the frog? What? Go to sleep now. How can I? Don't. Stop it -- I told you not to talk that way -- I don't know her. Don't think that way. What? Don't know her. You liked her? She can't help it. I didn't. Is it bad? Yes. That you guys shouldn't be here. Depends on what you believe in. We don't look on it like that. Do you? The best. Oh, yeah. Who's Dil? Having two pints in the Rock. Like what? Having a pint in the Rock. Doesn't matter where. Don't be so sure. Why? So what's that supposed to mean? Yeah? Shut up, would you? Give us a break. Hurry up, would you? Can't. Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree. My pleasure, Jody I'll bear that in mind. How different? The fastest. Best game in the world. Ever see hurling? And you play cricket?. Shouldn't take it personally. Why did you sign up? You could have said no. What the fuck were you doing here? What? She's a friend of mine So what were you fucking around for, then? You make a nice couple. She your wife? No? Why not? She'd be anyone's type. What? No. Didn't look like that to me... No, what's the funny thing? Shut the fuck up, would you? What the fuck do you know about my people? What do you know about my nature? Why can't we? I'm not a gambling man. They won't let him die. What makes you think that? Do what? What is it now? But I won't. We're more polite around these parts. Well, I could say the same about you. You trying to hurt my feelings? No? What's that? No fucking way. Can't we take it off? How did you know it was her? My pleasure. Am I? So, what do I look like? How is it a farce? What do you mean you can't? Eat something, would you? Yeah.What? Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called? Got to catch me first -- What you say, faster? But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back -- So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there? Faster than cricket? Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus? Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro -- I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus? Take the hood off, Fergus -- Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus? Tell me something, anything. What does that mean? Yeah? And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything. A story. I don't want to sleep. Tell me something. I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette. Help me. I'm sorry. Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking -- Take the whole lot. I won't need it. Take her picture. C'mere. See if she's all right. But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her. If they kill me -- Want you to do something, Fergus. Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too? Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all. Some kinds of women are... No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus? It's as simple as that? What do you believe in? I've often wondered how you do it. Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you? But you fellas never get a break, do you? We got simple tastes, you and me. My special friend. Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita. Like having a pint in the Metro -- You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring. Come on, man. If this shit was all over. Where would you most like to be now, man? Jody's always right. See? I was right about you. 'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature. Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man. Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you. Fergus? I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus. Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well. Now put it back in. These things take time, Fergus. Now, that was worth waiting for. Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you? Tree. Nice to meet you, Fergus. So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler. Toffs' game there. But not at home. . Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different. Never. That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other? Best game in the world. "Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham. It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face. Can't. Once I signed up. I got sent. What the fuck am I doing here. Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand. You fuckers set me up. That bitch -- Don't I know it. Suppose you could say that. Absolutely not. She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you. Don't you think of it, fucker. My inside pocket. Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something. C'mere. She's not my type. I didn't even fancy her. And you know the funny thing? Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go. I'm talking about your people, not you. Not in your nature. And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose. You want to bet? They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me. Kill me. You're going to have to do it, aren't you? Hey -- So I've noticed. Could you? No. It's the truth. Nope. Not handsome at all. Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup. Only joking. Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself. Please, man, I'm suffocating in here. I can smell her perfume. Thank you, handsome. Yeah. And the brown eyes. You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face. I seen your fucking face. This is a farce, man. Can't eat through a canvas bag. Can't. Fuck you. He believes in the future -- He's a good soldier, Jude. Have you no feelings, woman? Nice lady. Thought you liked me, bitch. Whatever you say, Jude... I never know nothing. Who gives a fuck. And you know what? Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude. What if I did? Don't run off, Jude. No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.Right. Right. Good. So what do you think? You being cynical, Hennessy? Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target. It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond. So what do you think that is, Hennessy? Good. And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you? And who is she? And what's she like between the sheets? Fuck you, too -- I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy? Should blow you away, you know that? And who's Dave when he's at home? Who'd you think it was? Okay. You're a good man, Fergus. You sure about that? Why do you want to do that for? What? Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus. Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days. You OK about that? Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why. And do you know why? You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me? Are you all there? So he knows your name? You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep. What the fuck is this? It's your decision. You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at. You sure? So? Why would you do that? Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers. Do you want a cup of tea? Give me the fucking shooter! Give me the shooter, Jude -- That fucker's dead -- That true, Fergus? You in love? Shut the fuck up, Jude.Aha. Do you now. So what do you need, Fergus? All right, then. I like to be wise. You'll notice I've asked you nothing. Fergus!If anyone's going, I could use some coffee. Fine. Can we get some coffee...? And why is that? I do? What is the five grand? What is the, you said that we were going to split five... You need money? Is that the... Do you need five grand? Why? In the abstract... Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal... Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand. Why are you doing this at all...? Why? Why, because you only told me about it? I didn't ask to be. That's ridiculous. Me? ...I thought that we were only talking... ...you don't have to come in... Yes. I'm sure. No. Why would I do it? Why would they come to me? What if you don't get caught? What does that mean? You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads? Dave. They'll know when you go over to Graff... I... Me? I'm sorry? You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and... You have to steal the leads tonight? What? He'd give me a job. A job with Graff. You're saying "me." For five thousand? What will he pay? What did he say? Did you talk to Graff? You're going to steal the leads? You're actually talking about this? Because, because, you know, it's a crime. We are? Did you? You didn't? So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff. Well. Well... As a robbery. Talking about it as a... We're not actually talking about it. As an idea. We're just "talking" about it. Yes. I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just... You haven't talked to him. How do you know he'd buy them? And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff. How many leads have we got? What could somebody get for them? Huh. What? How? Someone should hurt them. What? Yes...? What do you mean? What? What? When they... They... Men come work for you... That's what I... You... No. Huh. That's the truth... That's right... What act? What? What hard part? What? No, it's not that simple, Dave... The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things. Himself? With River Oaks? Yes. I heard that they were running cold. He is? Nurses. Yes. No. Who? Yes. For some sales pro... Shoes, boots, yes... ...that's right... No. That's absolutely right. ...that's right... That's right? That's right?

I...I... Where did Moss...? I... You think so? Why? No, who? When I talk to the police, I get nervous. No. No. Was I? At home. Yes. Where were you? Why don't you think so? They aren't? The cops? A waste of time? Why? Yeah. He said we... He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy. Were the leads insured? Were the leads... You think they're going to catch... where are you going? Where criminals can come in here... they take the... What. What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone... They stole... He said he filed... I am? Everything I...you know... Yes.

'Cause I can't do any... I'm fine. You mean the board? You mean the board...? Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups... I, you know, they should be insured. I didn't rob... ...how can you talk to me that... that... We had a robbery. That's great. Shelly, the Machine, Levene. Fuck. I had them on River Glen. Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet? I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right...

Twenty percent. For as long as I am with the firm. Fifty percent. You're going to be my partner. Fifty percent. Of all my sales. I... Wait...uh, look... Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it. Take it all... Take it! What? Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while. I am. I turned this thing around. I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am! I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night. I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch. Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not. Big fuckin' deal. I'm halfway hoping to get caught. To put me out of my... But it taught me something. What it taught me, that you've got to get out there. Big deal. So I wasn't cut out to be a thief. I was cut out to be a salesman. And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right. We're going to make it right. He told me my share was twenty-five. I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually. It was his idea. Do I have to tell you? Moss. Five thousand. I kept half. I sold them to Jerry Graff. I... I don't know what you are saying. Sure! I robbed the office. Sure. You're so full of shit. Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying? Well, hadn't it? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What? ...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that... you're scum, you're fucking white- bread. You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right. You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed. You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you. Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone... What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday. Why you don't belong in this business. Yes, I am. Yes. Mmm. Yes. Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it. I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something. You can't learn that in an office. Eh? He's right. You have to learn it on the streets. You can't buy that. You have to live it. You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed. You hear me? I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...? On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon. Would you? Would you...? Or you're gonna what, fire me? Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you. That's what I'm saying. You have no idea of your job. A man's his job and you're fucked at yours. You hear what I'm saying to you? Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care. You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls. You ever been on a sit? Ever? Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust... What does that fucking mean? All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale. It's better than a good sale. It's a... Did you tell 'em my sale? Get 'em to me! Ah, fuck. Leads! Leads! Williamson! Send me out! Send me out! What happened? The deal still stands, our other thing. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. I'd like something off the other list. Which, very least, that I'm entitled to. If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am. What? I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you. Yeah. Yeah. You want to do business that way...? Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. What is there on the other list...? Is that it? Is that it? You want to do business that way...? Why? Wait. Alright. Fine. The one. Give me the lead. Give me the one lead. The best one you have. Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job. You know that? Not too long ago. For what? For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch. I bought him a trip to Bermuda once... I'm asking you. As a favor to me? John. John: my daughter... I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow. I've got it at the hotel. John? We do that, for chrissake? You fucking asshole. I haven't got it. I haven't got it, John. I'll pay you tomorrow. I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow. I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow. Now? Now? Good. Now we're talking. Bullshit. They ain't been in the office yet. Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not? Eh? Two sits. The Des Plaines. Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up? Alright? The two sits in Des Plaines. I saw the board. You've got four... No. You're right. That's for later. We'll talk in a month. What have you got? I want two sits. Tonight. John. Listen. I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second. I'm older than you. A man acquires a reputation. On the street. What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay. Okay. We'll...Okay. Fine. We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine. For now. That's fine. A month or two we'll talk. A month from now. Next month. After the thirtieth. We'll talk. Alright. Fuck that. That's defeatist. Fuck that. Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me. Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it. I will close. John, John, ten percent. I can get hot. You know that... I will close. I will close. And what if you don't close. I can't close these leads, John. No one can. It's a joke. John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads. As a "test," alright? As a "test" and I promise you... Then put me on the board. Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me? Why? They all kick out. You run in streaks, pal. Streaks. I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me. Shelly Levene. Anyone. Ask them on Western. Ask Getz at Homestead. Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them. Ask them. Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in. They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too. And now I'm saying this. Do I want charity? Do I want pity? I want sits. I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book. Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it. Give me a chance. That's all I want. I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance. It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around. I need your help. I've seen those leads. I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy. They couldn't buy a fucking toaster. They're broke, John. They're cold. They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that. Even so. Even so. Alright. Fine. Fine. Even so. I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock. They're fucking Polacks, John. Four leads. I close two. Two. Fifty per... I'll tell you why I'm out. I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. I'm out. That's fucked. That's fucked. You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross. ...ah, fuck this... John. John... Money. A fortune. Money lying on the ground. Murray? When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest? It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight. Money is tight. This ain't sixty-five. It ain't. It just ain't. See? See? Now, I'm a good man--but I need a... Fuck him. Fuck Murray. John? You know? You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know? He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? The premium leads. Yes. I know what they cost. John. Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them. Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine? Ninety-six thousand dollars. John? For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets... Then how do they come up above that mark? With dreck...? That's nonsense. Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste. I want to tell you something... Yes. ...and I'm going to get bounced and you're... Yes. I am. I'm sorry to antagonize you. Marshal the leads...marshal the leads? What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell. Fuck marshaling the leads. What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that? Where did you learn that? In school? That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell. I'm the man to sell. I'm getting garbage. You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked. ...you talk to Murray... Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass. I need the leads. I need them now. Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you. ...it isn't you...? Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to? I need the leads... Lately kiss my ass lately. That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray. Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car? You talk to him. The Seville...? He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what? Cold calling. Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms? You call 'em downtown. What was that? Luck? That was "luck"? Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck. My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...? Bullshit. It wasn't luck. It was skill. You want to throw that away, John...? You want to throw that away? Bullshit. John. Bullshit. April, September 1981. It's me. It isn't fucking Moss. Due respect, he's an order taker, John. He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me... Under him? What is this "you say"? A deal kicks out...I got to eat. Shit, Williamson, shit. You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets. Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there? ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that? What is that...? ...then... ...do you want to go downtown...? ...you want to see the court records? John? Eh? You want to go down... What two? ...and what is that, John? What? Bad luck. That's all it is. I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks. That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks. I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say. ...I, if you'd listen to me. Please. I closed the cocksucker. His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know he was married...he, the judge invalidated the... No. John. No. Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please? Wait a second. Please. I didn't "blow" them. No. I didn't "blow" them. No. One kicked out, one I closed... John...John...John. Okay. John. John. Look: The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out. Fine. He's a good man. We know what he is. He's fine. All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away. All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation. We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the... Dave... Rick. Let me tell you. Wait, we're in the... I got 'em in the kitchen. I'm eating her crumb cake. "You do get the opportunity...You get them. As I do, as anyone does..." "You do get the..." Huh? Huh? Will you shut up, I'm telling you this... "'Why? Why don't I get the opportunities...?" "...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..." "Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..." "...you have to believe in yourself..." My ass. I told 'em. Listen to this: I said... Eighty-two thousand dollars. Ricky... Ricky, I... I think I'd better stay here for a while. Mm. Me. Rick... Rick...? Rick...? Kenilworth. Kenilworth...? Oh, my God, you're right! I'm on the one... Well, let's scoot... Didn't I say I was taking the two o'... Twelve-fifteen. No, his wife is. Go ahead. Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure. Sure, go ahead, Ricky. Oh! For the magazine... Home cooking... Uh... Which... Sure. My wife told me to look into... I wanted to speak with you about... No...Black Creek. Yes. In Florida? Glad to meet you. No, Mr. Roma. I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last... What is it? The hell with him. We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for... And, and, and, I did it. And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door. But you don't know. You don't know. You never heard of a streak. You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John. Fuck you. That's my message for you. Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff. Period. Fuck you. Put me on the board. And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today. That's all I have to say to you. ...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around. That's cold calling. Walk up to the door. I don't even know their name. I'm selling something they don't even want. You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it. Yes. I did. This morning. What I'm saying to you: things can change. You see? This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know. You can't look down the road. And see what's coming. Might be someone else, John. It might be someone new, eh? Someone new. And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history. You ask them. When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man? A month...? Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row. You know what that means? You know what that means? Is that luck? Is that some, some, some purloined leads? That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's... Bullshit, you're...No. That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did. I, well. I locked on them. All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them. I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: "Now is the time." They signed, Ricky. It was great. It was fucking great. It was like they wilted all at once. No gesture...nothing. Like together. The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment. Period. The whole eight units. I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying. I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility. But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen. I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign." I sat there. Five minutes. Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock. Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock. Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No. I did it. I did it. Like in the old says, Ricky. Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it. Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you. I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this. I do, too. I came here to do good for you and me. For both of us. Why take an interim position? That's what I'm saying. The old ways. The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check. The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units. Eighty- two grand. I tell them. "This is now. This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money. This is it, Harriett..." "What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it. And that's it." And we sit there. I got the pen out... From the store. "I want to tell you something, Harriet..." "You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?" Just now. They took the leads? When? They... Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch... Hey, big fucking deal. Broke a bad streak... That's right. You bet your ass. Who wants to go to lunch? Who wants to go to lunch? I'm buying. Eighty-two fucking grand. And twelve grand in commission. John. On fucking deadbeat magazine subscription leads. Get the chalk. Get the chalk...get the chalk! I closed 'em! I closed the cocksucker. Get the chalk and put me on the board. I'm going to Hawaii! Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson! Pick up the fuckin' chalk. Eight units. Mountain View...You cashed the check? What are the police doing here...? What are the police doing? And the check is... She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att... She told me not to talk to you. I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I... The deal. This. The power to negotiate. I don't have the power. I said it. I... I... That... I can't regotiate. I'm... I do. If I don't get my money back... She told me I have to. She won't listen. No. She told me "right now." She wants her money back. I told you. What's going on here? I told you. It's not me, it's my wife. The check wasn't cashed? I don't know. Tuesday. Yest... If we wait till Mon... But I'm not counting it. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. So it would have elapsed. I'm not. That's what they are. Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. But we have to before Monday. To get our money ba... To change our minds. To...you know. I don't know. They said we have three days. They said we have three days. I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um... She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know. The attorney gen...they said we have three days... My wife said I have to cancel the deal. My wife... I've got to talk to you... I've got to talk to you. Lingk. James Lingk. Gimlet. Mmmm... What do I...? I don't know. Did I...?Uh-huh. How ya doing? Because you listened. Yes. I lied. Alright? My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five. In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences. Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...? Is that what I just said? Why? Why you going to give me five grand? So I'm making it concrete. You went for it. That's none of your fucking business... That's right. Then tough luck, George, because you are. Well, to the law, you're an accessory. Before the fact. Absolutely. ...they take me, then. They're going to ask me who were my accomplices. ...and rob the place... Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight. That's something I have to do. If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here... Are you sure? You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you. Answer me. They come to you. You going to turn me in? They're going to come to everyone. They come to you, you going to turn me in? Listen to this. I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why? The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me. Why? Because I probably did it. Are you going to turn me in? George? Are you going to turn me in? Oh, yes, George. Yes. Yes. What will they know? That I stole the leads? I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn. Why did I go to Graff? I got a better deal. Period. Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case. It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go. That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff. I can't go. I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much. I've got a big mouth. "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..." Yes. You have to go in. You have to get the leads. You. You... That's right, the guys are moving them downtown. After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch. After the contest. What? What? The leads. Yes. It is, George. Yes. It's a big decision. And it's a big reward. It's a big reward. For one night's work. But it's got to be tonight. He would take you on. Yes. Is that what I said? Yes. Twenty-five hundred apiece. One night's work, and the job with Graff. Working the premium leads. However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw. Five thousand dollars. Split it half and half. A buck a shot. Yes. What did he say? He'd buy them. Is that what I said? Did I say that? Have I said that? That's right. That's right. It's a crime. It is a crime. It's also very safe. Yes. I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George? We're just talking... What did you say? No. Not actually. Not actually, no. Hey. As a "robbery"?! No. No. No. Yes. We're just speaking about it. As an idea. No, we're just... No. What do you mean? Have I talked to him about this? Graff? Because I worked for him. Yes. The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand. Five. Five thousand leads. What could we get for them? I don't know. Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them? All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know. That's what I'm saying. We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff. Someone should rob the office. How? Do something to hurt them. Where they live. Yes. Something. To pay them back. Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch. Should do something to them. Somebody... Someone should stand up and strike back. I want to tell you what somebody should do. Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no. No. You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something. They have... ...you're absolutely right. You fucking build it! Men come... You build it! You... You don't ax your sales force. That's the God's truth. And it gets me depressed. I swear that it does. At MY AGE. To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month. P.S. Two guys get fucked." He made up those rules, and we're working for him. To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves. To please. To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those... Just the act. Of doing the thing. The dif...the difference. Between me and Jerry Graff. Going to business for yourself. The hard part is...you know what it is? Starting up. Yes. It is. It is simple, and you know what the hard part is? What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing... That's what I'm saying. Why? The leads. He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here. Why? We have to go to them to get them. Huh. Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads. River Oaks, Brook Farms. All of that shit. Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week. You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well. He's doing very well. The nurses? He's doing very well. So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild... That's thinking. Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself. He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who? Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?" Look at Jerry Graff. He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see? You see? That's thinking. Why take ten percent? A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away? What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff. He goes out and buys. He pays top dollar for the... you see? You know who it is. It's Mitch. And Murray. 'Cause it doesn't have to be this way. Yes, it is. And you know who's responsible? ...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No. It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong. For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..." ...cower in his boots... And so they kill the goose. I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to... Eh? Goddamn right, that's right. Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before." Eh...? I know it's not. I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car. Sell him five cars over fifteen years. No. It's not right. Some contest board... All of, they got you on this "board..." You get a bad month, all of a... Eh? It's too... We're stuck with this fucking shit... And now... They killed the goose. Well, they fucked it up. The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great. You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important. All of them. You go in the door. I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard. You work too hard. We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh? Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..." You had one you'd know it. Patel. They keep coming up. I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen. They're lonely, something. They like to feel superior, I don't know. Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes. My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine. Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea. Speaking of which I want to tell you something: I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.

I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out. You understand? Will you excuse us please? Will you excuse... Yes. They're inured to it. Thieves. Yeah. You know who doesn't? You have nothing to hide. Then don't sweat it, George, you know why? Yes. See...? Were you the guy who broke in? I was at home, where were you? Where was I? Why? Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..." No. Yes. The cops. No. Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy. Yeah. That's swell. Another waste of time. To the cops?

Yeah. That's swell. Yes. You're right. How are you? What do you care...? Hey, hey, hey, easy friend. That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev... I'm going to the Chinks. You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette. And let's put this together. Okay? Shel? Say okay. You're done, come down, and let's... Anyone in this office lives on their wits... I'm going to be with you in a second. What you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you? I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin. I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on. You're going out, I swear to you, you're going... You stupid fucking cunt. You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars. Six thousand dollars. And one Cadillac. That's right. What are you going to do about it? What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit. Where did you learn your trade. You stupid fucking cunt. You idiot. Whoever told you you could work with men? You call them again. Mr. Williamson...! I'm talking with Mr. Lingk. If you please, I'll be back in. I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson. Yes, I have a problem. Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while. You got it...? Where are you going? I've...look. Will someone get this guy off my back. Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed. Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection. I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed. They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts... Are you talking to me? Fuck insured. You owe me a car. And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back. You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car. How the fuck do I know? What...talk to me. Who told me wh...? You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...? You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me. Oh, fuck. Fuck. FUCK FUCK FUCK! WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!! OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON... Don't fuck with me, fella. I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me... ...did they... Did they get my contracts? Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...? Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta... Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk? Yeah. I've wanted to talk to you for some time. For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with. There's a man..." You know? I never said a thing. I should have, don't know why I didn't. And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it. It was admirable...it was the old stuff. Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what? There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today? One moment, I'll be right with you. In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which I can't talk to you about here. I'm coming, Ray...what a day! I'll call you this evening, Jim. I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch. I'm sorry, Jim. I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. Oh, God...Oh, God... Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express. His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land. I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight. I have to go. You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go. I'm sorry...? What? No. You said the one. That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth. Oh! My God...I've got to get you on the plane! Ah. Ah, his wife is. Ray: what time do you have...? Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he? You're sure? Yes. Is this something that I can talk ab... The monthly interview...? Home... "Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,, Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex... But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...? Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's... I can tell Jim what you do...? Beautiful. Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something. You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants. I know you do... Well, we'll do that this weekend. Yes. I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with... I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel. Kenilw... You're a client. I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms. I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth." Oh, Christ. He's right, Williamson. That's right, Shel. ...yes... You closed 'em today? Like you taught me... Harriett... "Always be closing..." Fuck her... How was it...? Fuck you care...? Fuck you, Dave... Guess who? Mmm. Last night, this morning. They took the phones... Shelly...! Eight units? You sold eight Mountain View? Not to my knowledge, no... It's nothing. What did I tell you? What did I say about the three days...? What? Forget the deal, Jimmy. Forget the deal...you know me. The deal's dead. Am I talking about the deal? That's over. Please. Let's talk about you. Come on. Come on. Come on, Jim. I want to tell you something. Your life is your own. You have a contract with your wife. You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things. Those things are yours. You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew. This is your life. Yes. Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me. Now let's go. Right now. Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink. What? What? What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink. The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it? What, "this"? To negotiate what? To negotiate what? What power? What...? Say the words. What...? ...what, what, say it. Say it to me... What does that mean? Where are you going...? This is me...This is Ricky, Jim. Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it. You understand? This is me. Something upset you. Sit down, now sit down. You tell me what it is. Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am. Sit down. Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside. It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me. No, Jim. No, no. That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that. We'll speak to her, Jim... We're going to speak to her. You tell me again. Tell me again. Your wife. Tell me again. What is? I'm very sorry, Jimmy. I apologize to you. I just called downtown, and it's on their desk. Today. Today. Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case. What was the earliest it could have been cashed? And when was that check cashed? What was yesterday? When did you write the check? What would have elapsed? No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day. You don't count Saturday. I don't understand. Three business days. They mean three business days. Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book... Of course you have three days. No, I don't know. Tell me. Three days. Why did she do that, Jim? Who did she call? Monday. It's a common reaction, Jim. I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment. One thinks twice...it's also something women have. It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again... This woman can cook... It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no. We'll go out to his home sometime. Let's see. Tomorrow. No. Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go? I've got to get Ray to O'Hare... Come on, let's hustle... John! Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. Jim! What are you doing here? Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton... James. I'm glad to meet you. I'm glad to meet you, James. I want to show you something. It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. Well, let's have a couple more. My name is Richard Roma, what's yours? Money? If that's what it signifies to you. Security? Comfort? All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU. That's all it is. How are they different? Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab. Some busboy wins the lottery. All it is, it's a carnival. What's special...what draws us? We're all different. We're not the same. We are not the same. Hmmm. It's been a long day. What are you drinking? I don't know. For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm. Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf� au lait. She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete. Eh? What I'm saying, what is our life? It's looking forward or it's looking back. And that's our life. That's it. Where is the moment? And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss. What else? The bank closes. We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em. We worry anyway. What does this mean? I'm not secure. How can I be secure? Through amassing wealth beyond all measure? No. And what's beyond all measure? That's a sickness. That's a trap. There is no measure. Only greed. How can we act? Yes. Or a piss...? A great meal fades in reflection. Everything else gains. You know why? 'Cause it's only food. This shit we eat, it keeps us going. But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had. What do you remember about them? Yes. ...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit. It gets so you don't mind it. That's the worst thing that I can confess. You know how long it took me to get there? A long time. When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do. You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer. You think that you're a thief? So what? You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...? Get shut of it. Shut it out. You cheated on your wife...? You did it, live with it. You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality? May be. And then what? If you think there is, then be that thing. Bad people go to hell? I don't think so. If you think that, act that way. A hell exists on earth? Yes. I won't live in it. That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...? Have a good trip. Your farewell to the troops? What is this, your farewell speech? I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are... Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately. Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. Is that what I did? Dave? I humiliated you? My God...I'm sorry... Who said "Fuck the Machine"? It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you. And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth. They took 'em... We haven't got a lead... Harriet and blah blah Nyborg. Guess who? Eight units. Mountain View. You hear what I said? Mountain View. Eight units. Guess what the Machine did? You going to turn State's? What, they beat you with a rubber bat? Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen. I GET HIS ACTION. My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half. You put me in with him. ...Mr. Williamson... John... It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk... Mr. Lingk and I are going to... Patel? Fuck you. Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign. And Vishnu, too. Into the bargain. Fuck that, John. You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads. Three? I count two. Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine. What's the fucking point in any case...? What's the point. I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit. I'm going out and reclose last week's... I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift. Patel? Ravidam Patel? How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs? Where did you get this, from the morgue? 'Cause I don't have to eat this month. No. Okay. Give 'em to me... Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all... Oh. Oh. Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine. No. Swell. 'Cause I don't have to... With what? With what, John, they took the leads... To the restaura...what do you fucking...? Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac. You did? Yes. ...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk. I closed... Some of them... The... Did they... They didn't get my contracts.Mmm. Will you get out of here. Will you get out of here. Will you. I'm trying to run an office here. Will you go to lunch? Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? Excuse me... Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here... Go to lunch, George. Just go to lunch. The leads come in, I'll let... Go to lunch, will you... Shelly: get in the office. That's right. You want to go out today...? What? I don't know, George, why? I'm sure that we're insured, George... Who used to say that? Fuck you. Because I don't like you. I'm sorry. Call up the bank. I called them. You stick around I'll pull the memo for you. I'm busy now... Forget it. Frame it. It's worthless. Where have you been, Shelly? Bruce and Harriet Nyborg. Do you want to see the memos...? They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb. And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living? How can you delude yours... Only the beginning... What sales? No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away. No, I don't think so, Shel. You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. I want to tell you something, Shelly. You have a big mouth. Mmm. Uh-huh? Was it? That was easy, wasn't it? Who kept the other half? How much did you get for them? How much did you get for them? If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in. If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail. Believe me they will. Now, what did you do with the leads? I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail. What'd you do with the leads? You want to go in there? I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night? You better have one. What did you do with the leads? If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk. You robbed the office. Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank. Last night I didn't. How did you know that? One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you. Now how did you know that? You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job. This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me. Now how did you know that contract was on my desk? No. It hadn't. I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank. You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help." How did you know that I made it up? How do you know I made it up? How do you know I made it up? Excuse me... Why I don't... What are you trying to tell me? You are? Mmm. Yes. I hear you. Mmm. It's not impossible. I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly. That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle. The only thing remarkable is who you made it to. Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense... How could I tell 'em your sale? Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads. Alright? Shelly. Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal. You made a good sale. Fine. I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago. They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's... The leads are coming. Somebody broke in. That's alright. Is that what you're saying? You want something off the B list? Because I say so. I can't split them. I have to go... I can't do it, Shelly... No. Can't do it. I wish I could. Now. Yes...When? Alright. I've got Roma. Then I've got Moss... I'm not sure I have two. What are we going to say? And fifty bucks a lead. Twenty percent. Not lately you can't... What if you don't? Then I'm fucked. You see...? Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you. What if you don't close...? Of what? I can't do it, Shel. You start closing again, you'll be on the board. ...apart from the top men on the contest board. The leads are assigned randomly... ...they kicked out. Yes. Either way. You're out. The...Shelly? The hot leads are assigned according to the board. During the contest. Period. Anyone who beats fifty per... Will you please wait a second. Shelly. Please. Murray told me: the hot leads... Murray said... Murray said... You know what those leads cost? Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second. I'm hired to watch the leads. I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy. My job is to do that. What I'm told. That's it. You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads. ...let me...are you listening to me...? Let me... You're saying that I'm fucked. I have. And my job is to marshal those leads... Murray... ...after the thirtieth... It isn't me... Not lately it isn't. Moss. Roma. All that I'm saying... ...I only... ...no... ...no... Four. You had four leads. One kicked out, one the judge, you say... What about the other two? Shelly... ...you didn't close... Shelly, you blew the last... ...I wouldn't worry about it. Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon. And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case. Your contract went out to the bank. Mr. Lingk. James Lingk. Your contract went out. Nothing to... We had a slight burglary last night. Yes. Please. Please. The police can be... Yes. Three. The word from Murray is: leave them alone. If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town... I'm giving you three leads. You... If you don't want it, give it back. ...you want to go out today...? I have the stuff from last year's... Aren't you going out today? Where are you going? I... Yes. It went down. I filed it. You closed him yesterday. They took some of the con... Listen to me: They got some of them. They got, listen to me... They didn't get the contracts. They--excuse me... They didn't get your contract. I filed it before I left.Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John. So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard. Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero. People watching you all the time. Waiting for you to make... a slip. Slip up. There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself. I dunno. It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes. That's good enough for me. You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it. You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right? Just keep me outta prison. Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee. She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph. She thinks you're some kinda holy man. You got it? Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee... Bernie. Call me Bernie. You woulda gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice... Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are. For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity. I wasn't thinking clearly. Listen, I'm no hero, John. I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit? You didn't spend it all didja? I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being around them if you know what I mean. There you go, you inspire this kid to live . I probably woulda vomited on him. Great! You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump. Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards . Well, we gotta work this thing out, John. It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions. Looka those maniacs, willya? They love you, for Chrissake! Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John. Right. What's the big deal? You decided to pretend you were me. A little moment of weakness, right? So I sorta swiped her purse. I got feet of clay too, bUddy. Lighten up, John. You think you got problems for Chrissake? I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John. Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy. Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart. You could, like, rest up for the jump. Jail! Listen, Bubber... This is crazy. We could fall off of here. I was in the can, for Chrissake. I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks... What am I, a goddamn postman? I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter? Put a stamp on it for Chrissake! In private. They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones. I just wanna talk with you for a minute. Then you can jump. You can jump twice for all I care. Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights. Hey, Bubber, c'mere! I gotta talk to you, buddy. Hey, do I look crazy? I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators. "Keep a low profile," that's my motto. Sell it to him. You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride. I got a job, nice apartment. I do okay. One leg! Like the Red Cross or something? Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake! You got a drinking problem or what? Try stupid. Nah, I fucked it up. I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why. I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard. He musta blew up. I got the hell outta there. I didn't have the nerve to face the kid. I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty. Children's Hospital, on the double. TAXI! HEY, TAXI! Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks. TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE! Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff. You are naive. Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare? That fake inspired you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job twenty-five hundred goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna do time ! You're s'posed to be an attorney for Chrissake! You're s'posed to have good judgment ! You whaaaaaat? You paid it? You gave a bondsman ten percent? Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail? If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me? Twenty-five grand is peanuts! All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect. "Angel!" I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong. Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks. Some of it. Right here. I got some of it. I'll get the rest as soon as I can. She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence. Uh, his birthday, uh, May. I think. Often, uh. Involved! Christ! She attached my goddamn paycheck! Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer? You know what I mean. Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced... A son, yeah. What about him? Joey. Yeah, I been calling in sick. They think I got the flu. He gives a good report and I walk? I know what he means. I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day. I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake! Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator. You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country. "Anticipation of incarceration"? Bail, for Chrissake! I'm innocent! What's going on? "Guilty"! What is this? Look, I got this kid. We got a goddamn relationship! I'm takin' him to a movie tonight! He worships me. If I go down what's this do to my son? I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake! Do I hit anybody? You see me shoot anybody? Hey, drugs! Do I sell drugs? Jesus, I don't belong in prison. I'm a family man. Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right? You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer. They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms! Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages... Hey! Do I have a record? Have I ever done time? I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff! Have I ever been convicted of anything? The thing is, Chick. I'm goin' down. Nothin'. I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me? Ya wouldn't, would ya? Yeah, like that. Same thing. What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife? Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore. I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here. You got a right to throw me out. You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all. I cornered the whole goddamn market. You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...? You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know. Those guys been in here? When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being. The thing about kids is, they're so... young! They don't know nothin' yet. When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else. I can't afford no better. My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments. You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance? Nine. I think. Maybe ten. Yeah, ten. Nice kid. My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake. 'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why. I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh? Business thing. Gimme a seven and seven, willya? Some guys been looking for me, Chick? Spanish kinda guys. Bill, I got financial problems and... Bill, listen... Bill, I got some legal problems and I... I... Bill, I... I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life. You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev , it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle. Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important... The homeless! Three weeks, Ev. I didn't tell him I killed anybody... "Elliot"? The heroic goddamn fireman? That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind. Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize. Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened. What happened is... Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood? Is he here, your friend. The fireman? Ev, it's not my fault! I'm trying to tell you this incredible -- You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn! Absolutely fantastic! I'm on my way -- Me? Listen, I don't give no interviews. That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day. Who am I? You're asking me? You're the big expert for Chrissake! I'm what? The "Scumbag," right? The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the... You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people. I got a kid, you know. I'm a person, for Chrissake. Lie, you mean... I'm going to apologize to Bubber? Underbelly! -- saved your... whaaaaaaat? What? Blackmailing...? Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude. I saved your... "Harassed." Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo? The guy's a thief, he took my... What, is everybody in love with this, bozo? I don't get this. What about...? My fault! My fault! This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault? The cops! What kinda bullshit is this? Is this America or -- ? Me! How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake? Hey, put that thing down. This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just... Turn that thing off. You! Mmmmm. Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older. Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay? It don't go no further. What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..? You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy? Well, the thing about life is... it gets weird. See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit . Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another. So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's your bullshit, so to speak. You got that? JOEY! Here we are. Yeah, that's a possibility. A movie. Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time. Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that. She's still like that, right? Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better. Thing is, I got all this business stuff... Thanks. Thanks, pal. I'm working on that. It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter? Me in my uniform. Used to be on the bookcase. You never saw that picture, huh? It was this war. Viet Nam. Doesn't matter. Oh yeah? A hero, huh? Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot? This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh? He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?Looking... good, partner. Hang in there. Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine. Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse. Why not? I had this shoe. I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie. On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything. I can't tell him what we're up to... And give a deposition to the jUdge. --but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie. Almost half. Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La... You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me. Allen? He... he's okay? It was you! I thought I heard... I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me! Huh? Whadda you mean? And she thinks you're blackmailing me? You stole her purse! While you were saving her? What have I done? I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest. You should go in. You're risking your life again... The bathroom! For two days? I never really thought they'd go for it. And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record... I kept expecting you to show up and expose me... That's close enough. It's a confession. The truth. Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante. I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems. That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley. Talk from there. You can talk from there. LaPlante! They interview you or anything? At the plane crash? I know a guy who only has one leg. You should give it to someone with only one leg. In bad weather, yeah. Mostly I camp out in the woods. I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up. I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food. A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying... And you pulled people out? You're... a hero. "A little mistake"! You do? Gale! This is for you. I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything. It's not right, Gale... Bodybuilding! Gale... That's not what I mean... Gale! I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!' A script! I thought we just walked through everything... Vietnam! Uh, right. A... news story. I... no... I don't have the right... I... You... you think I saved your... life. I can't take advantage.... Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way... It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention. A couple of... years. Uh, no. But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and... Is she... serious? A half a million dollars? In my behalf? Yes. Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as -- Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars. I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect... Uh, er... I...Down. You mean jail? For that credit card stuff? For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer... I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern. A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being. It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it. No offense. Me neither. I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy. Heroic. You and me, we're not... heroic. It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined. What about it? Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern? Is this a riddle or what? You mean like Bubber? The hero? I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie. You in business with those guys or what? I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern. Bernie, how'sa kid? We're all assholes, Bernie? I didn't even know you had a kid. You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie? You gotta kid? How old's your kid? Nope. Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney. What is it, five days now I don't see you! Spanish kinda guys!He's gotta be a nut! He saves all those people and swipes a purse ? Swiped your purse! While he was saving you? You gotta be kidding! LaPlante! This guy LaPlante won an award? What is it? What's the matter? Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I... We're gonna wait here? The guy could be hours. I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy... Yeah, I got it. Sports training. You learn to follow the ball. How about you do a wrap-up from up here? I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.How'd it go? WHAT? THEY FOUND WHAT? We're piecing together different accounts and... Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger... There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear... That too. She broke up with her boyfriend. Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis. You're sitting on your ticket. Unprofessional. For ten more minutes they love him, Wally. I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public. What? Helluva story! Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante! She let Channel Eight get a beat on us. She can't quit. Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved. Don't be emotionally involved, be professional. No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are. You are a goddamn cream puff! Try and be a hard-ass! Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything. Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't... "Quit!" You can't quit! It's unprofessional! She's talking to him now. Said he's not an actor. Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite. Never stop worrying. I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town. Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background. Relax, Wally. He had the shoe and the shoe checks out. We're gonna feature Gale's cast more. The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story. But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive... Not bad. But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story. Network's taking everything we give 'em. They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not. We're very big nationally. She's flying to New York. She's been nominated for a Silver Mike... Saving people is not our job. It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off. He's right. It's unprofessional.Mister LaPlante... Mister LaPlante... Mister LaPlante...Reporters don't have hormones? You didn't... get it on with him? Is he like that in real life? So gorgeous? There's no face really, nothing to work with. Big dots, that's all you'll get.Uh, no. Yeah, my dad's great. He took me to the zoo. Yeah. I'll see ya... dad. I could go to a movie Thursday night. 'Cause we don't have school on Friday. Here. Get off here. Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend? What picture? Were you in it? In the war? "The Nomm"? What's that? Sometimes. His name's Elliot. He saved a guy's life one time. In a fire. Dad! What's "cynical"? Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom? I... I saw him out the window. My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here. The "unknown hero." They found his shoe right beside the plane crash. He lost a shoe!Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you. They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants... Excuse me, Ms. Gayley. That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants... I didn't ask him. Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you. From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton. He wants you to call him.I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT MY PROBLEMS. YOU'RE ONE A MY PROBLEMS. GET OUT! OUT! OUT! OUT! I TOLDJA. JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING! AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT? AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET? THAT'S IT! YOU TALKED! YOU'RE FIRED! OUTTA HERE! GET OUTTA HERE! YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN EXCUSE ! IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX." NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE. THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE. DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE! DON'T SAY ONE WORD! DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"The Presidency. The public loves him. It's not unthinkable. No, Deak, not a great story. We backed this guy, he's our boy! We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars. Listen, Deak, what if Bubber has got something to hide? What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...? She wants to quit? Quit? She wants to quit? We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings. He's not supposed to be an actor, that's the whole point. He's a real life hero , all he has to do is act like a real life hero. That's the beauty of the concept , the whole freshness of it. Did she call him back? Upset! What's he upset about? Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him? I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something. What about a reward for coming forward? It's a wonderful piece. Emotional. I love it. A Silver Mike! You're covering us in glory! Ticket! What's going on? You wouldn't push the guy, would you? If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself. An hour after...! Deak, for Heaven's sake! Let's give her a night in New York City. We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel... You didn't? Never reach out!No dead body. Too bad. Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive! Half the time he don't answer even if he's home. Know why? 'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him. I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends. Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley? Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me! "This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!" Incredible. Unbelievable! For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now? 'Cause he stole paint ? LaPlante! That asshole! I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?Not on station time. And I believe what you say. But this is TV. No pictures, no story. Right. Like last night's doozie. C'mon, Joey. I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here. What, you think I'm kidding? I guarantee it. An inch more flank. Boys upstairs get hot. Bingo, you're an anchor-woman. I mean hardly any thigh. I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.You wanted a story. You got it. Turn on the TV now. And then get your ass down here ... ... OK. Be careful. And lighten up. Story of your life could be right round the corner. Joey .... Look, you wanna ride? I can go by your place. Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery. But that's all it is. Mystery. Not malice. What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?The Box, Joey. He wants the Box. Your apartment. This is his first night on Earth. He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back. He has to destroy it. Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another. You're stronger than you think. I like you, Joey. You ask all the right questions. There is something we can do but it will require great courage. He'll do what he does best. But he'll do it unfettered. He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering. Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws. The protocol of Hell. The Box had to be opened to let me out. The truly innocent were safe. That's no longer true. The shell of the beast has been fleshed. What I was is out there, Joey. In your world. Unbound. Unstoppable. Something bad. The cusp of my life. What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision. I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery. The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently. This is me a few years later. We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921. I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see. So many dead. For us God, too, fell at Flanders. We adjusted to the loss. And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further. I went further. I thought I was a lost soul. But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant. Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey. And we have to stop it. I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true. Will you walk with me a while? Well done. Brave girl. You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right? Correct. The fields of France. And many dead flowers ... Oh. Forgive me. My name was Spenser. Elliott Spenser. Captain. You have to help me. You will understand. And no, you're not dreaming. Do you know where we are?Right. Like you were hog-tied or something. I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life. And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else. Get dressed. Get out. It doesn't bother me. I'm just not interested. Unh-unh. No. Thank you. Yes really. ... Let it define you. Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month. Don't do that! Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it... Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar. And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty. He's a barman. Whatever. Do you mind if I continue? You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ... It's yours. You won it. It's a prize. Thank you. Uh-huh. Welcome. 38 How do we start? But how in God's name ... Hey, that's what makes the world go round. What!? What are you talking about? Why should I help you? Fuck you! No! No. It's not the same ... I ... No. What you did ... it was ... evil. Yes. That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway. What ... What ... ? Yes! God, yes. I ... I just want to hug you. To hold you. To tell you it's alright. Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me. You know that. It was my fault, babe, it really was. And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now. I hate to see you in pain like this. That's terrible. What a bitch. She was obviously just using you, Terri. Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore. Sure. Sure. I understand. It's cool. I mean, we've got all night. Terri, listen. Why don't you come here and kiss me? I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right? Is it going to happen? Isn't it going to happen? Let's get it out of the way. See how we feel. Then we can relax. Talk. You know. Not now, no. I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean? Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up. Put her heart and soul into it. No. But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it. You found a real treasure for me, Terri. I hope I can show you how grateful I am. C'mon. It'll be great. Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over? You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk. Just see how we both feel? That's so good to hear, sweetheart. It really is. You know, I .. are you alone? I know. I know. It's bad. I'm a bad person. But I try not to be, Terri. I really do. And I really miss you. Hey, it has been known. C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy. I have regrets. I'd like to put things right. Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh? No. I mean, really? Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart. I care about you. I guess I miss you. I'm sorry we split up. I'm sorry I ... Really? Will you relax? Your little girlfriend left a card, remember? Live and in the flesh. How're you doing, babe? Not quite.It has already begun. God? My God was diamond and black light. And I was his Dark Pope. All that is changed. A terrible beauty is born. With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes. You see, we're not so dissimilar. A dark star rising. I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed. A friend relieved me of that inconvenience. Now I'm free. Born again of Blood and Desire. Because you want to. You've always wanted to. Look at your pictures. Look at your sculptures. Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine. Imagine a world of the body as canvas. The body as clay. Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you. Don't flee from yourself. If you have a quality, let it define you. Cultivate it. It is you. By helping me, you will help yourse... I understand. Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional. What else could you do? Good. So did I. And that's all ... On the contrary. It has everything to do with the world. And our dreams of how it will succumb to us. You enjoyed the girl? What did you see? The same as I. Appetite sated. Desire indulged. You saw the working of the world in miniature.How about any guys on your staff? I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently? Is it your vehicle? I'm afraid it's the "van" again. That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living .. Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down. We're not here . I don't want the desk to hear us .. Hit those wipers, Ross . What d'you mean, "bits." Bull shit .. I'm in my prime .. I guess by the bed. Listen, you don't havta come? This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas. I'm going up to the institute. Jesus. What are you doin? That's just what I wanna find out. You got a quiet phone somewhere? Are you sure you didn't call? Can't thank you enough, Ross .. Screw Citrine. He can fire me. I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there .. Don't give me that! Not another word ! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said yes . So as far as I was concerned, she's ly- ing . And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because you told me .. I'm sick of this toy town shit . How the hell do I know who ? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick. That's a very stupid question, Ross. No .. You didn't know that .. One hundred fucking per cent ! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?" I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion. Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it. Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ... Sure. She wasn't lying about the van. Just makes to so God damned mad .. I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files? God, it pisses me off, Ross. Car accident. He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank. You looked like you did? I wish he'd tell that to Citrine. All but .. How you doing? You believe me, don't you? I was wrong. We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer Eight ." I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years .. That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me? He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you. They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity. Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head. I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that. What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! .. What do you want it for? I had one puff on a pipe . Why? I haven't got it. Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it .. Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky .. We're going. Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump .. Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something .. Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something? This looks promising .. I think this one could be it? I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building? I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics - - Last seen 5 weeks ago .. O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him. Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?" What do you mean, Ross? What do you mean? A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar .. How'd you do it, old man? I am stopping smoking ... Maybe? Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10. It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 .. It's a method for quitting smoking. I already did. What's his problem? There's nothing in the files? Why so coy about the word "frozen"? What time is it? Not too good in daylight .. O.K. Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda .. Not for me .. Who is who? Yeah, he can go ... Two dogs. He should do the dogs. We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs? I think you're here all day. What about that kid, Ross? So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing? Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed .. No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist." I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look .. Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife. I hope I'm not intruding? I am calm .. I am calm .. I'll sign anything you want. Please . Bring here her .. I want Helena here .. I want Serato .. Why can't I have Serato? No. I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything? That's bullshit, Once. Three or four. Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman? We have a multiple homicide, Sir .. If you're not gonna hear me, Chief .. It's her hand. Her scars. Her dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing. No, Sir. No. He hasn't hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow. Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been. What do you want me to do, Chief? I thought it was Taylor's case? I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut .. Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy? Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair. Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here? It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something? Why did he ask if it was frozen? Maybe he's lying to you? No .. But we have a theory .. I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire .. Is this normal? My pleasure .. Who's Popeye? Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one. Week or two. Musta been on the ker- osene. Stinks like a diesel engine. You haven't . And you got no voice in here, Taylor, so keep it shut . I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life .. He ain't offerin me shit. I know what a "witness" is. You don't know what you done, Taylor. Just walk away from me, Taylor .. Don't you know nothing about this guy? He reads the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried .. So read it! You just hung a target around her neck! Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case! You put it in there. Vehicle references. .. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J .. How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere .. Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with. Yes, Sir. I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is? I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for .. It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is .. I think they're gonna arrest me. You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart .. You do? He doesn't need my help. He don't know that. I didn't. Coz he thinks you're a witness. The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to kill you - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to kill you - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here .. I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand. No .. not now .. She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight. Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now .. It's not possible right now. You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"? You're looking worried again, Helena? Who? Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.? Has he got your aunt's address? You know? How do you know? I have to talk to you, Helena. Which is what? He said that? What else did he say? Really? What did he say? How d'you know what I'm like? I was married to her sister .. She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon .. .. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee .. No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers? He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail. Pray? I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing? Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?" I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that. Was. But I don't like to talk about it. There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me. Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with. No. No. What are you reading? I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out. Of course I would .. I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?" No problem. I'm not in a hurry. No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music .. What color was it? Did Amber have a dog? Lotta scratch-marks on your door? D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog? Me? Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small? Can I see your hands? The elevator wasn't working? John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John? No. You must have some idea about him. What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend? I'm Mr Berlin. Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.? O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K. Who sought the warrant? You got a warrant for this? Why? What are you doing, Travis?You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down. Coz I'm short of men & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - you get .. Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you. And did they? He says, you freaked one of em out? "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" .. Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students? I'm talking, outside the girl? Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute? I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John. We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - and a bill for seventeen dollars for its wig ! I have heard you. You just don't like hearing me . You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, in this country , would put a task force together for a body part .. She's not "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? No . She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John. It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris .. Have you got a print from the hand? Have you got a match on the bullet? Then where's the body ? .. Where's the body, and why's he hidden it ? You're pushing this too hard. It's like you want me to say stop ? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little? I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is right now , that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this .. Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had. Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this. Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body? I don't see that at all .. What is all this Jennifer stuff? How do you know her hair's black? What is that? That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone .. Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it .. Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about .. .. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do .. Interview over, Blattis ...You ain't going in alone? What if we need a back up? Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties .. Bits. It's twenty of three. Where's your watch? Hey .. Now? What exactly you doing, John? I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty .. Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops? Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey .. Don't thank me. Thank Margie. What about Citrine? I dunno what I can do to help you? Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite. Ease off, John .. I'm asking it. Well .. I didn't know that .. You don't really believe this? I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro? You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved? Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been any van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's blind , Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother .. You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril .. You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction. Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For nothing , I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes? If there's a body under the snow, fuck it . Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this .. John, stop it . The case is on its ass, you're closed. C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer .. Stop it. No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking. Why's she blind, Bro? No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day. Did I say he did? I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators .. Did he shut you down? What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes .. That isn't what you said before. For a dead dog ? Listen to me saying what? Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this. How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months? You want me to stop the car? It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs? To throw out of the window. I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash." I need some security. I don't trust you anymore. Then give me that Zippo. Pay me, and I shut up. So am I. But where's my money? Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime. No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll. No, you didn't. What ? She's blind , Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano? Thank Christ we got a witness. Where is everyone? Pig Woman agreed to take a test. No you don't. That's how you think you feel about him. That's how you feel about yourself . You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for you . Because I dislike her too much .. Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present? Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles. Someone bet me a dollar .. I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean stop .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, you can .. You gotta stop smoking .. Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief .. You want my advice? Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none? He thinks you stole his promotion. What exactly you doin there, John? It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case. Watch my lips .. Don't get into it .. Because, don't get into it ... Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall. C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted. You're gonna love it. This is "God's Country," John. What does that mean? How's the new residence? Since when did you drink diet soda? What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is French champagne. A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa .. Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here. The dogs ? What do you think? Oh, shit. Of course. The kid. Travis . Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so get it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at? Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - this is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months. Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide? "Welcome to Eureka." You heard. Look for the knife. Be my guest. What you got? Did you bring it with you? And you got no idea with who? Yeah, I guess I do. A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with? Got a handshake like a partially excited penis. She married some English prick. I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R. Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away. I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea. She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here. Even better. Tonight I'm feeling lucky .. Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat. Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour .. Shut up, King Jay .. Alright, guys. We stop this now . Whass going on here? Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight. Ask him. Whatta you mean, "horrible?" Don't annoy me, Travis. Where do you fit in, Trimble? Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got? He has? .. What's he doing here? I'm already walking. Where is it?I've heard you call him Freddy. He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it .. Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat. If , your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for one out of two fucken seconds , she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago .. Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert. Bullshit. Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what? I may have said some- thing. I don't recall. His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper. Wrong cabinet. What are you looking for? Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John .. No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to stop this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing me , & everyone off. He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There is no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean everyone . You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera .. Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant .. No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.The man from the F.B.I. Yes, Sir. I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy. I been told to take your car in, Sir. The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict? I think I've found a hand. I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir No, Sir. I wonder what would make him do a thing like that? His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body. A derelict. He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K. On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there .. You can drive down there, Sir ..My God... ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife... Well... uh... thanks... Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or... ...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat... I... um... God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?! How'd you know that? Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream-- There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes. That's Renee alright. I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know? Pretty much so. Yes... why? Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive. What? He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious... I had a little run-in with Zowie. What do they do up there? Out? Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way. Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in. So where're we going? All set. Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die. What are you talking about? Geoff, dinner's ready! Geoff?! "Out." Well that's great, Geoff. Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again... Hey! Where're you off to? Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him. Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't. I think so. You alright? Hey! How was your first day at school? You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you... What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten? What's wrong?! It's been a few years.Zowie... I'm not trying to prove anything. I was burying my dog. Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are. Just until he heals up? Is he gonna be okay? You ever think about running away? I gotta go back and do my chores... I don't know... ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you... I don't know but I'm not taking any chances... It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie... It's weird... Maybe it takes a while... You think he'd believe it if he did? He was dead. You know he was. Yeah... I've never had anyone die before... ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually... You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule... Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try? What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works... ...he'll come back alive. The old Indian burial ground. This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed. There's a better place... I'm not burying him here... Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here... Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad. I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead... Sorry about your mom. I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus... I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before. Zowie.Anywhere but here. All set? He did. We buried him. There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive. I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back... I'm not hungry. I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep? Just out. I'm going out, Dad! Who was that? I still can't believe she's dead... What? It sucked. I'll be fine, Dad. Sure. Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs. How long ago did this guy retire? All the time. Go later... Dies? Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus? What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us? What do you mean? How can he not have a heartbeat? You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better? Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him. It's getting pretty late. We better go. You never get over it. You want me to help? Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out. Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself... What did? Why not? Is this a good spot? What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life? You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad. He pissed me off. What's his name? Mom... I know, Mom. Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight... I mean... he misses you, Mom... Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool. Right here, Mom...I was building a doggy door. I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now. --Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this? When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys. I suppose so. I hear you moved into town. Did she always have reporters following her around like this? Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law. Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove? Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass. Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner. Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander... You took over for Doctor Yolander? Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea. I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...I must tell the Cardinal. I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive. I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again. Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them. I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended. Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.SING! SING! SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR! SING! Yes, Mary? LET THY SPIRIT LET THY SPIRIT LET THY SOUL BE HEALED LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH LET THY SOUL BE HEALED LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDEDI said I was a nun, not an asshole. Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something? You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention? Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell. Well... yes. Yes it is. Really. YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE And I'm tearful! But I'm fearful! Were you tempted? HE'S SO FINE... He's... dreamy. He's... I think they hear you! You know what we're saying! You know, I just might! I think I hear it! But how? What you say? You know it. How are you doing. Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun. Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I do. And you listen to that? Probation? Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here? At Sunday School? Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..." Thou shalt not. So, hi there. I'm... Sister Mary Clarence. And you're... young Christians. I guess I should assign you this passage. What's good? What were you talking about? What? You can handle this. Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience? His ashes? Then stop trying to memorize it. Hit the road. What do you want? This is a private area! Get lost! That used to be true, Vince. I was with you. But something happened. And I'm different now. Real--different. I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience. And I've got just two words for you. And those two words are... Right here. Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this. I feel sorry for you, Vincent. And I forgive you. I am sorry for all my sins. And yours. Good evening, Vincent. Right. Yeah. Forgotten. Sure. Thanks. A lot. No... it's fine. You lying sleazeball! The best years of my life! What am I, garbage? Am I lint? You pig! You bastard! What? You said that? And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her? Did he say we'd be happy? You did what? Today was the deadline, Vince. Vince... Who? The other woman. Your wife. Come on -- stay. Just a little. We can talk, I'll get a pizza. Pizza in bed, we'll have fun. And you still haven't told me what happened. What did she say? WISH HE WAS MINE. THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR. HE'S SO FINE. He's so dreamy. He's like... a Greek god. He's the cutest guy here. He's boss. He's fab. He's... Look at that. Get a gander. Oh my! This prom is a real drag. Oh, girls. Were you wicked? Pay attention... What a shame! It's true -- I know her. Get moving. I'm right behind you. Jackpot! Two buckets That man -- who is he? And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse. And so you truly need our prayers. Because we're So use it. When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration. Most music is. So don't hold back. Let all that joy go right into your voice. Make me happy. Let me hear it. Perk out. Perk down. Hold it. Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you? Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups? It's a rhythm section. The beat. That machine. No way. We're a choir, right? Headliners. The big room. Two days a week won't cut it. Every day. The goods. The sound. The sale. Let's rearrange a few things. Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto. Get over here. Mary Robert --with the sopranos. You see? We've got the voices. They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me. We just need charts -- harmony -- chops. Hold on. Is this... choir practice? I love my heddles. Show me again. Just about. Show me again. Oh, right. At my old place, we used to... wash cars. Groom dogs. So... nice loom. But don't you get money? From the Vatican? Why? Not in years. No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING Where did that come from? Right. Sing! Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White? You know? About me? About everything? That's true, wouldn't that be great. Of course, we never know when things are going to change. Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow. Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular. I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up. What? Babies Hopeless I Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting. Make it look easy. Again! It'll be hell. A bunch of real mama's girls. I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you think? They're pretty raw. I hear you. How many days a week do you rehearse? Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline. Hard work. Yeah, for one second. That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other. Be a group. Mary Robert. What? Sure. Kind of... free-lance. Um, I don't really know this one... Whatever. You know that song? Like this place? What? Which convent? It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight. In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass. Frank. Dean. Sammy. Right at ringside. What did He say? Don't you know it! It's true! Bless you. She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go. Run! Take off! They're from my old convent. Right to Hell. Just kidding. Where is that bus? Oh no. We'll always be together. It's contraband. Don't ask. But I wanted to give you a treat. A sort of... thank-you gift. Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house. WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART Give me a C. A C! Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out. Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night... I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler. Experience! Goddamn it! Keep moving! Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. I mean, nothing really happened. We just... took a walk. Honey. Good point. Especially that dude you were with. I'd like to see him down front. You watch yourself! This is your neighborhood. Your turf. You should get to know 'em. Initiation. You understand. Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head. Right. Bobs It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program. How old are you? You shouldn't be smoking. Have you ever seen a diseased lung? Hand 'em over. Now you. We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place. We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert. Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent. Wait. Well, then there's only one thing to do. She said that? Reverend Mother? She won't? Why not? Excuse me? Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you? Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents? We can call the Enquirer. Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows? Three years. A rookie. So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's? Right. Okay. Bob. Nice to know you. Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce? Sister Doug? A cigarette? What? What? What does she want now? I did the dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why can't people share? Five a.m.? What? What time is it? Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late? What about me, Reverend Mother? I think you were right. I'm just a bad influence. Sister show biz. I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham? Then I guess you're stuck. Life sentence. No parole. You saved my life. Reverend Mother -- Thank-you. What are you doing here? But... Okay, so I just got things started. But you could build on that. You could keep it going. But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it! But -- there's so much more to do right here. And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone. But -- why? What? Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving. In just a couple of days. You sent for me? But... wait a minute... A vote? Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals? What do you mean? Please let me try. I'm begging you. Hold on. That's not fair. I worked hard with them. They gave up their free time, and they loved it. Those women are happy. And we can get even better. We can wake this place up. Exactly. People like going to theaters and casinos. But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint. I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in those seats. Not the choir, please, anything but that. The choir -- I mean, have you heard them? I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I No. No. What? I am? But you can't kick me out! Guys want to kill me! You're a nun! A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep? I mean, I'm a major sinner! All-time great! Hall of Fame! Aren't I, like, your dream come true? Your Olympic event? A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A janitor? I know! I'm sorry I didn't mean for it to happen! And I was the one they were shooting at! Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen! So... hi there. Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star! I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver! Really catching on. In English? It never solves anything. Sometimes it's not enough! Have you been out in those streets? Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them! Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough. I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age. I wish somebody would talk to me about it now. Deal with it, sweet thing. It's important, nowadays. You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana. I got it. Yeah? What's wrong with my life? Wait. No. You're kidding. Lights out? At nine? My day's just starting. Right. So what do we do now? Ping- Pong? Row over to the monastery? Oh, I don't know... Satan? It's like the Stone Age. The room time forgot. What about a phone? Right, sure thing. But what about, like, appliances? Like a little color portable? Boom box? You were right the first time. Is this like, solitary? The cooler? Where's the furniture? My what? That's tomorrow! Don't you have any snacks? Machines? Is this all the food I get? No food? A what? Silence? No talking? All day? A what? I'm outta here. Like to who? No problem. Mary Clarence? Like a guy? Like a dumb guy? But look at rites Look at this! I'm a nun! I'm invisible! I'm a penguin! No! No! I can't do this! Can do. How about a robe? One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket. "Guest of St. Katherine's" Deal. Cool. Is there a menu? Or buffet? Fine. Got it. Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right? I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice. So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me. I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low. So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb. Capisce? What's a concubine? You mean black people? Are you talking about me? What? What? What? You see? You see? I have to get out of here I have to make a phone call. Don't you get it? I'm in a convent! You're a nun! Beats me! What do you think? Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone. And wearing a black bra, under my uniform. The demon bra. I was expelled! When I was fifteen? Parochial school. Akron. St. Android's. Oh my God. This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening. It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's! That's my real name! Currently I'm a singer. Sort of. Christy. Christy Van Cartier. Mother Theresa. Gandhi. Don't you understand? This is all a mistake. I'm the good guy. I'm the witness. And I'm being punished! A convent? They put me in a convent? What's the problem? Wasn't there any more room in Hell? Yeah, like what? Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun? That depends. Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news. I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true. Even nuns have to pee. You don't get it! It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time. They're singing for the Cardinals. It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this. That's not the point! They need me! Eddie -- I've got to go back. They won't sing without me. I'm deserting them. I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral. We're singing for the Cardinals. I can't go with you. How? I know, I know. I'll be careful. I'll try. I've got to go. I have? You're not... seeing anybody? Well.. thanks. I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes. I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here. I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun. You mean -- worried about my testimony? Really? Lieutenant? I am? I know that. This isn't about me. It's about the choir. You should hear them. They're good. Really good. And I taught them. I really can't talk about it now. The place is packed. SRO. I've got a show to do. It wasn't my fault! They just showed up. It's helping the convent. Eddie! You scared the hell out of me! So what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Does she know people are trying to kill me out there? What'd she say? Do you hear that? That choir? Eddie, in here, that's what they call music! But it's a nightmare! Mother Superior is out to get me! She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture! You son-of-a-bitch! Like what? But I'm going insane! All these people do is pray and work, work and pray! I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food! Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet? Get me outta her! Eddie, you've got to get me out of here. I can't stay here! I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do? But Vince has contacts all over the place! This is San Francisco! They'll be looking for me! With nuns? With rulers? No way. I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince. Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here. Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em. I hate you. I totally hate you. What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me? Okay -- no limo. Okay, here's what I want. I know about this stuff. A five-star hotel. With room service. All right! I get the picture! I'll do it! I'll testify! Ten flights? And if I don't? Screw you! I don't know anything about bodies! I mean, he didn't bring it home. He was good to me... sometimes. He was sweet. He took care of me. Who am I supposed to go out with? He owns a casino. He let me sing. I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me! They tried to kill me! I'm not kidding! Right between the eyes! Down and out! The guy was gone! I... I couldn't believe it! Think again! And get out of here. When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant? What do you want -- cheap thrills? He's a businessman. 'Cause you're always out, arresting people. Making trouble. I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing! I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard! Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron? At least he's not a cop. At least he can afford a decent gift. But -- wait. People throw stones. They call me names. I mean, really. Jerusalem is a real drag. Everybody hates me. Hey, girls.I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure. Don't you have a concert to go to? What're you doing? Nuns? They need you? A bunch of nuns? For what? Moral guidance? Make-up tips? I think they'd understand. You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here! What? Long story. His goons will be here any minute. We've got to get you out of here '- now! Vince knows you're here. Just remember - you're a target. Don't you think Vince has a T.V.? You re sort of... radiant. your eyes are shining. You're rea1ly different... No. Most of the time I'm thinking about you. And now... you've really changed. Me too. No -- worried about you. Personally. I've been worried about you. Yeah. You look... great. I mean it.. Jesus, look at you You're glowing. Listen to yourself. This isn't a career opportunity. You're supposed to be hiding out! What if I was Vince? You'd be dead right now. What are you doing giving interviews on TV? Go in and talk to her. It can't hurt. Go. She's counting on it. She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival. You blew it -- big time. She doesn't want you back. Don't call again. It's not safe. I'll be in touch. I just need a few more weeks, Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead. Calm down. Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately. Not again. You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are. Pray. Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent. Nobody knows you're here but me. We're trying to get a quick court date. A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can. And one bullet. That's all it's gonna take. It's a convent. All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along. Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here? I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you. No nothing. Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune? Let me spell it out for you. You have to hide like you don't even exist. You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight. Maybe Hawaii. Get a stenographer. You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street. Then-you run. He didn't do you a favor. You couldn't believe it? Vince the Prince? Information, baby. I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience. A what? When are you qonna wake up? Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then. I told people you were a hooker! So I don't shop. I used to buy.you,..stuff. On your birthday . When we were seeing each other. From Vince? What a guy. Doo-lang, doo- lang. I wouldn't even tell the Pope. Where's who? Jesus. Data-base hoods. It's a wonderful world. Beloved daughter missing. Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so. Dead or alive. Then one day they find you. We could put you into our witness protection program.That... thing. That nun thing. Take it off. Okay, Christy -- strip. What? Yeah, right to the cops. No way. With love. You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen. A nun? We didn't tell you what? We're the guys from Vegas. You had Christy last night, but you let her get away. It's upsetting. I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him. We're looking for Mike. But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun. Where is she? I can't see anything in here! Which one? Which one! Maybe pants. Right. It didn't work, Vince. Yeah... But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent? Not... totally. It's a bluff, Vince. And if she runs? Vince -- is she... okay? She's praying. And then we can ice her. No nun, no evil eye. For like, twelve zillion eternities? I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to. You didn't shoot! No smart-ass remarks or nothing. She's gettin' away! So that guy in the bar was right? She's like... some kind of nun?I'm telling you! That she's a nun! That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun! But you didn't tell me! Who are you guys? You found him -- but we're not open yet.You won't even tell us? Vince is getting desperate. Where is she, Eddie? Where'd you stash her? They open a window. A hiding place.I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp! Joey -- do it. She's afraid. Come on, tell the boys you're afraid. What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you. What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you? Babe, what happened here? Look at you. And to say you're sorry. About this afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you understand? Forgotten. Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me? Yes? Babe, it's not me! I love you! It's God! We can still see each other. Just like always. It's a different kind of sin. Smaller. You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I'm nuts? He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell. For all eternity. For the first time in I don't know how long. I wanted everything done right. Open and above board. I told Father Antonelli I was in love. I told him it was a special love, for all the ages. I want us to be together. Like people. Honest, decent people. In the eyes of God. Babe, today... I went to confession. How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank? You are so damn sexy. What did who say? She's a broad! Got it! Just some broad! Joey? Willy -- hit the lights. There she is! Get her! I'm telling you, she's not a nun! Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes. So, take it off. You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot. Well? I can't believe this. Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time. It didn't happen. What's the problem? It's done? You know so much. They've got Christy, and we've got to find her. Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge. Fax it to every contact we got. He's so damn cocky. This is different. Take care of it. Maybe. Find 'em! Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right? Are you nuts? She's not a nun. It's Christy. She's a babe! And who are you to talk? You were nothing. You couldn't even sing. I must have been out of my mind. I love you, Chris. I always will. I gave you so much. My time. My affection. A big-time career. And how do you repay me? What's the thanks I get? Where's the loyalty, huh? Where's the love? Can you hold? Can you try? Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely? She did. Bring her back. Now. For a talk.What's she doing? A sweater. Strip down a nun? You want us to fry? That's what I figured, too. Neither did you! She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car. Forget her! We got the one we need! Step on it! Yeah, right -- when I see it. Where? We both missed. She's... she's a nun. She's acting weird, Vince. Ever since we picked her up. She's a nun, Vince. It's that call you were expecting, Vince. I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away. Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out. My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no... Ah! Love and hate are blood relations. Find your bowler? What kind of man? You're not from around here, are you? I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.It's splitsville for you. After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed. Sorry about your loss. Heh, heh, heh. Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right? Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from Sid. Haven't seen a ball like that since '69. Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand. Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz. I'd buy it! Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out. Did you know you were parked in the handicap space? Bowling police, step back, give him room. Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring. Wait! That's an aria! - canker sore. Sure, Sid. No kiddin'. It was a clearance. You listen to the feelings, not the words. How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music! La da da dalala... Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door. I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till. Are you guys bruddas? Hey, you still here? When you get a chance. Ah, come on, lemme see your ball. Lemme see your ball. Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli. Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?Theo's bowled on the tour. Sheila, meet...uh... I forget the name. Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz. Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling. Wish me luck. Miles, I've always been on the square with you. It's a beautiful thing. Seven years. What's on your mind, Miles? You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call. Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn. Don't say I never gave you nothing. I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen. Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me. Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze. Thanks, kid. Where are you goin' now? So, eh, you never saw me. Right? Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero. I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo. I am underground. We ain't married no more. Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man. I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up. You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner. Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television. No... He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life. Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour? Theo, I want you to get out of this town. You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face. That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie. I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles. What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin. You wish! I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out. I do what I gotta do to survive. What's it look like to you? If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner. It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan. It's the next level, the next dimension... ...the small ball. kissed a lotta tadpoles. Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you. Putt-putt golf. Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter. I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders. You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie. You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit. I ain't nobody's father! You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz. I don't know no Grace Skinner. Who are you? Who sent you here? Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you? Who gave it to you? Where'd you get this ball? Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip. Theo takes the other glass. That game was before you was born. Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark. Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress. Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips? What do you think I can do? 100 years! I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day. Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies. Need some advice, huh. I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour. Buzz Fazeli. You see what you did? Take your ball and get out. Millie, please. I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door. Millie, I know what I'm doing. Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here. He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips. Clam it!I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes. I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi�ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger? Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning. Cool!You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games. Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her. You shouldn't touch her. JUNIOR! You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another. NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right. Knock-knock. Who's there! Who's there? It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father. You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you? J'you-and-your-friend do it yet? Junior. Come on Sheila, knock-knock. It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father. Blueface! Blueface is my favorite. Someone wants to play with me? You made me hurt him! Needs lubrication. Lubrication. SHEILA!I'm sure you have Buzz. Simple math, Buzz. Two plus two does not equal three. And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz. A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt. brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch. And now we got a beautiful thing. This scam we got going here was your We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz? I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior. I have someone for you to play with Junior. We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light. Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy. Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about - I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there. Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other. Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands. If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other. It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center". He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder. I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila. I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul. You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you. A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! - shish kebabs. Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good. I think I could help you, Theo. There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive. Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy. He's earned an early retirement. But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future. I wanna show you something. If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves. Profits down there, philanthropy up here. Besides, it beats the pants off bingo. Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ? Now go take out your "big four", darling. Come on, we're making her nervous. It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance. How's Gloria's thumb? Maybe I can help you. Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey. I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day. I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress. Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers. Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away. So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner. Bowling "Center"! Fantastic! What talent. Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that. Sheila and Kastle sit up. Look who's talking! She ran away to be with that... that Motocross champion. You're just like you mother! Always jealous! He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand. See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior. I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank. Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three! Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment. I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty. You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff? Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke! No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman. His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it. Now swing it out a little to the right... Line up where you want it. That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.See ya 'round Faz. The Faz sure took care a her. Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid. Think he bought it? She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho. Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you. Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball. Hello Mr. Kastle. Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden! How do you turn this thing off? Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick! But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden - gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun. Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no You know, Elvis bowled. You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera. How do you know, you don't even speak Latin? I hate fuckin' opera. Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct. So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs. Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out. Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you... What was that he said...? Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you. We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him? Three whips. To go. You afraid we're gonna steal it? Yeah, basement bingo. What do you want with old man Faz? No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl. No! If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. Someone gonna get kacked, boss? Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl. Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli. The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality. Your time is up, busyboy. You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car. You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health. What are you gonna do, call the bowling police? Very good, busyboy. Breeze, give him his ball back! Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers! We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community. If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz. You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it? Lane's closed big fellah, league night.The pin machine? Maybe I should have left the ball in the car. Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee. 99 years, 241 days, 15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down. A bowler. I'm looking for a man. I'm from Akron. No. I'm from Akron. You have orange whips? Nope. You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in. I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one. You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical! He's my dad. I don't know no Buzz Fazeli. It belonged to my dad. Where can I find Buzz Fazeli? See ya 'round Maynard. I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window. I never saw you. You're a scumbag. What about bowling? It could just as easily have been me in that box. The whole world thinks you're underground. He says that to all his wives. I couldn't care less. I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz. That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split. I didn't think so. You got a better offer? I gotta survive. I'm getting to like it here. I don't need the stinking pro-tour. Fuck you and fuck bowling. Don't say that about my mom! I'm your blood. You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face. It looks like dwarf bowling. What the fuck is this? Maybe I could bowl in Japan. Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies. The small ball. Putt-putt golf? Theo. She thinks someone's trying to kill you. What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz? Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma. I got a right. You're my father. You knew her. You married her in 1963. I'm your son. You're a hard father to find. She's my mom. Grace Skinner. It's mine. Thanks. My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.' Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame. Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame. I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron. I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king. I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli. They suspended me for 100 years. Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side. I'm not on the tour this year. Theo. I gotta go. Love ya mom. Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late. I found dad. Hello, mom? Uh...over easy. How's that? Theo. Howzitgoin. Don't tell me, John. I don't want to play. What did you do to Buzz? What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles. No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her. Who's there? Buzz Fazeli. Knock-knock. It depends. I don't like to talk about it. Where's Junior? You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway. Why would you help me? How Mr. Kastle? I like the sport the way it is. What ever happened to just bowling? What if he wants to get out? Nice set-up. That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control. What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle? You might say I'm at the top of their shit list. You know who I am? Where can I find him? He's my father, Millie. I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car. I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie. They suspended me. I'm a bowler. Is Mr. Fazeli in please? You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue. I am a professional man. Sez you! You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who? Fuck plan C! My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you? You're really pissing me off. What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh? SSHHEEIILLAAA! I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me. Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin. At least I'll die smiling. I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again. When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously. I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel. I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car. I didn't stop to take his pulse. You should. He's dead Sheila. You wanted me to kill him, didn't you? How do you get this thing down? Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you. What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet! It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer. You told Junior that we did it. I'll be at the bridge. He's my father. It's Junior, isn't it. Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head. Why not? Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable. You got any broken bones? Too late for what, Sheila? Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history. Too late for what? Zip. Why should I help that old fuck. Nope, I couldn't care less. Then it's true, isn't it? About... What about the guy he put in the body cast? What are you going to do about your brother? If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him. I could let them go for ten. More than you could afford. I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo. I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers. So why do you stay? It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad. Really? I kinda like it. What's plan C? Sheila, please. He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days. Nothing. He said he'd sponsor me. Plan B is your dad. Well, that was plan A. I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling. No, I'm fascinated. I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do. Do I want you? Unfortunately what he wants is you. So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates? No. Do You? Not while I'm in training. I'd rather you didn't. The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers. No, not at all. Whoa. What does he do? Where did your brother escape from? Kinda tough on the butt. Isn't this technically a scooter? This is a vicious cycle. Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be. Business. I came here to have a word with your dad. I'm not here to - I can't... Do you know where they're taking him? Do those two work for your dad or mine? Uh...over easy. Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips. What's your specialty? You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls. I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him. Who identified the body? Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here. So, Buzz was stooling for you guys. Dwarf bowling's illegal. Tell your little pal to let go. Basement bingo? You guys got something going on downstairs? Some unfinished business. I'm looking for somebody. I'm not here to bowl.Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood. Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards. I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.Just wondered. Anybody could be scared. We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers. Maybe he ain't so tough. He didn't say nothin', huh? What'd he say? He's coming ain't he? Building his porch! Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns. Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter. Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing? 'Course he's coming. Ha. He was building his fucking porch. Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree. Nope. I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German... Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...Ah, I see. Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play? Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again. A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe. Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president? Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied... Mmmm pistols. You leave me at the mercy of my enemies. Be careful with those, sonny. Not really... Maybe a couple of Peacemakers... I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them? Books. He's my biographer. WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends." What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck. Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers. Shit and fried eggs.Uh... a little, maybe. No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was... Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'... We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...Innocent of what? If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window? Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way... I fined 'em instead. Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice. No? Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess. Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches. He give 'em names? He tell you where them others is? Don't matter, we don't need no whips. Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna... ...wouldn't let you settle it, huh? Oh yeah. Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day? Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet. I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around. Oh. I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska. Who's your friend? Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it. Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen? Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob. You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went. Those cowboys messin' him up? He admit it? Alive? Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends. I could run off them whores. That much, huh? They really got all that money, them whores? Word must have got all the way to Texas by now. All week? An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne? Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons. Yeah? Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set. Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all. Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me. How do you like her? You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies? You figure nobody'll want to fuck her. Property. No? I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole. I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house. I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children. There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot. I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such. Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so? What's your name? You're spillin' your whiskey, mister. Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols? Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all. What? Huh? Oh. Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles. I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then... No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character. "Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby." Give it to him. Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though. Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds. Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas. Look here, let me show you somethin'. See this here pistol? He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn. Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver. Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end. Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry... Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell. First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of. Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that. Duck, I says. "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." Meaning the duck himself, I guess. Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher. That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death? The... Duck of Death. A book, huh? I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob? Letters? You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. See? You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife... I... I guess not. I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that. Me? No. No, I guess not. Oh. Yeah. Free ones? Advances? Yeah, I guess. There's still a payment, ain't there? That big guy lookin' for me? I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead. Three days? I must be. Oh. How long I been here? Scouting? I didn't mean no offense. I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up. Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ? Some big guy beat the shit out of me. I guess I must look a lot like you, huh? I thought... you was an angel. "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill. I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned. Now step aside. boys. He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend. Well, uh... it ain't loaded. Uh... yeah. Yeah. I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed. Uh, William... uh... Hendershot. Like I said, I... I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns. Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms. Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk. Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid. Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it? An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done? Then... what? What'd Ned say? The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they? They got a sign on him in front of Greely's? A sign on him? Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more. He hanged him? Shot him down? Who killed him? Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned? No he ain't. He went South yesterday. Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before... I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed. Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle. I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle. This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles. I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all. You better get on back, Miss. Lemmee see it. Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it. We all got it comin', Kid. It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have... Take a drink, Kid. Well, that fella today, you shot him alright. Yeah? First one what? Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Just SHOOT! Cover me, Kid, while I mount. Did... you... get... him? Yup. You can shoot him. Yup. He's in there. Yeah, he's in there. It's gonna get riper yet. Shut up, Kid. After a ways. Yeah. Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think. I got him. Better re-load it. Shit! If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there. He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him. He got the boy's horse. Finish him, Ned. Get some sleep, Kid. Well... I don't recollect. What business? Easy, Kid, easy. Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear? Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you? Lookin' at? Huh? He's my partner. He don't go, I don't. Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid! Three ways, I figured. Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe... Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'... I don't never see nobody anyhow. Been gone near three years now. She's passed on, Kid. I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess. I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness. Jesus! What for? About what? Oh. Schofield? You from Schofield? He said that, huh? Maybe I ain't. Yeah, I guess so. You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me... ...for somethin' I done in the old days. Hold on, mister. Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand... William Munny, yeah. I could tell you who was last, mister. I was lucky in the order. I always been lucky killin' folks. Yeah? Huh? Yeah. A writer? What do you write... letters an' such? You sure you ain't armed? You ain't shot. Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear? I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch. Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together. Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit. We got to kill this other one first. Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money. HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT? She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'... I seen her... I seen Claudia too... The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die. I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river. He's a snake, he got... snake eyes. Ned... Is that you, Ned? Ned, I seen... death. Worms was comin' out. His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside. I seen him. You... you remember Eagle Hendershot? Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool. Yeah? No. I know it's rainin', Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha? Not for me. I don't touch it no more. Yeah... you said that last night. Fifty yards ain't bad. Guess we better get along. Shit. Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'. HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY. IS THAT YOU, KID? HEY, KID. HEY. I didn't see nothin' planted. Beats the hell out of me. Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse. Yeah. Sometimes... yeah. I don't miss it all that much. Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that. A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh. Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies. Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more. Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared. Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none. Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness. I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters. Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up. I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her. She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more. She gave me the evil eye. It ain't nothin', don't fret it. She don't like it much, you goin' off with me. Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here. We'll come across him tomorra, I guess. Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle? Two weeks, I guess. Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess. We done stuff before for money, Ned. Eleven. Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first. Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody. Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more. Who said that? What? Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it. Did I what? Well, I come back, didn't I? He say anythin'... The Kid... ? The Kid, yeah... Tom? Three? That ain't bad considerin'. I guess you lost some hogs to the fever. Best we move that pig. What is it, son?I ain't waitin', Bill. I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back. Supposin' he don't go to the ranch? You want the Spencer, Bill? I'm goin' on down to Kansas. Two. Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...? Easy, Bill, easy. Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes? Easy, Bill. Claudia... ain't here, Bill. Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies. Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you? He's dead, Bill. Huh? Uh... yeah. You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys? I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two. What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete... God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'. I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows. I guess we could use some now. Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed. I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back... Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed. Jesus. How far kin you see? Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close. Why would the Kid shoot at us? Kid? The Kid's shootin at us? You're marking us, Bill. You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field? He ain't shootin' our way no more. He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way? He hit you? Some fucker's shootin' at us. Whaddaya do, just use your hand? No. I mean... ...an' get yourself a woman? You know? Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all? You ain't like that no more. Nor Quincy, I guess. You ain't like that no more. You was a... a crazy sonofabitch. Well, she... It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly. Sally? Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm... Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... He musta been movin' right along. Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'. Three ways? This Kid, what's he like? How long you gonna be, Bill? Well, I guess they got it comin'... But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive. Well, we thought we was doin' it for money... What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella? Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans. Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em... How long since you shot a gun at a man? Nine... ten years? We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers. Yeah? Just like that? An' if I spot 'em? You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys? We'll bury him. Maybe. We done that stuff. Depends what he told you. About Bill, you mean? I don't kill nobody without him. We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth... Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window. He ain't as tough as you, Kid. Move the candle closer, I can't see. Plenty of times. How many you killed, Kid? I don't like the question. Yeah. He's blind, for Chri... See that scrub oak yonder? We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards? I'm a damn good shot. See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot. You was right to change your mind, Kid. Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass. Well, you was shootin' every which way an'... I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent. Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'... What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?Thank God. What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect? FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES? The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little. STUPID CUNTS! You told them cowboys you had it. Where'd you get the money, huh? Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two. You could run off them two cowboys. You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas. I didn't hear nothin' till last night. Yup. ...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah. Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks... What's all that wood? Heard you done the roof yourself. Hit your finger, huh? She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore. Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it. Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies. This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital. Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.You're gonna kill him, ain't you? Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill? I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess. You could have it. All of it. You... gonna take... the money? Sure. Sure, Bill. Wha... what f-for? I trust you, Bill. Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'. Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger. H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'... How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true. That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'. First one I ever killed. That was... the first one. Say, Bill... Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute. Was you ever scared in them days? I can't see 'em. Yeah. Is it him? You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself? Tell me right off if you see him. Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money. You still think he's in there? You're gonna lose your share. If you don't... When we gonna double back? They takin' water? He ain't killed. You missed him? You didn't...? What happened, did you hit him? What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on? What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on? Did you kill him? He ain't dead? You didn't get him? You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens. You don't recollect! An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself. Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that. Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened? Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch... Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow? What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know? You're goin' back with him? No. I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three. Wasn't nothin' said about no partner. If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala. Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect. Oh. Huh? Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy... Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece. For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too. Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys. Well, how about it? On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol. I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me. Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear. Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer. I could of... easy. You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over... Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County? Hell, yeah. I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before. I'm more killer than him. I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em! I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet. That ain't what I mean. Well, suppose he does? He's gonna die, ain't he? Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said. All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks. We don't need him. The two of us could do it. Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow. That was your idea, I wanted to... Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an... He didn't even pull his pistol, huh? He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one. His pistol must of jammed. Jesus. You done this before? Five. I killed five of 'em. That counts a Mexican I killed. He come at me with a knife. Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape. How many men you killed? Ain't you gonna answer? Say, Ned... ? I ain't blind, you asshole. Fuck you. More. Far enough. Yeah? Oh, them. Hell, I seen them. You gonna share your half with him? Nothin's bent. I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me. We didn't talk about no other fella. Thought you was followin' me.I guess you didn't kill nobody then. N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'... K-k-kill somebody? No... I meant... All that money... I mean... did you...? Did you... did you... ? Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week... how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was... Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time. The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol... That fella come by... Tom. Three. Hullo, paw. Who's he? Two more hogs got the fever.
