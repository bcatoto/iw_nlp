Me-gan! Daddydaddydaddy. Frankie uses the footrest to crawl up onto her dad's belly. Wake up Daddy. What time is it baby? She sniffles. He notices. When's she going to get back? She probably just went out for a run. She'll be back soon because she's going to get thirsty. She's going to be thirsty? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 2. You know what we should do? We should leave her bowl full of water and her dish full of food. Because she's gotta get hungry and thirsty sometime. You know? Dean's optimism is infectious. Frankie nods slowly. Like me. I'm hungry. I'm so hungry I could eat your toes. Dean pretends to gnaw at Frankie's toes. Breaks her sadness. We're hungry! We're going to eat you. They pin her arms above her head and 'furber' her armpit. Don't laugh. Come on, don't laugh! Cindy doesn't laugh, she screams. What happened to the flute? Cindy pours the hot water into a bowl with instant oatmeal & raisins. She blows on the food and places it at the table. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 3. I don't like it... Cindy turns on the faucet over a pile of dishes, returns to the computer to e-mail herself the missing dog flyer. Here... we can make it taste better. Dean spoons the raisins out of her bowl onto the table. This is how a leopard eats. He laps up his coffee like a cat. She mimics. Dean laughs. Lepers don't use spoons. Are you gonna listen to your mother? I think you better. Frankie reluctantly takes a tiny bite. Her face sours and she lets the food fall out of her mouth and back in the bowl. Cindy returns to the dishes. How old are you? Five. Okay, eat five bites. Dean gets up, goes to Cindy at the sink. We gotta get a dishwasher... Tries to take the dish sponge away from her. She resists. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 4. I'll do it. Come on let me do it. She drops the sponge, dries her hands. I love you. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 5. Put your seat belt on. She starts to back up. C'mon. What's the big deal? Cindy does as she's told, looks over her shoulder, scrapes the curb. Watch... Cindy cranks the wheel straight, puts on the gas and burns down the road. Dean stands there in his driveway, muttering to himself. He watches the car disappear down the street. Another car, headed the opposite direction, barrels down the  road, past the Periera home. Slow that piece of shit down! There you are. Cindy places the flyers in her folder in a rush. You got a second? Did you get a chance to talk it over with your family yet? I don't have to tell you, it's a huge opportunity... All right, Monday's our day. I want the A team up there with me. Talk it over. Feinberg walks away down the hallway. Cheer up man. God wants you to be happy. God's a woman and she's pissed off at me. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 7. Didn't think you were gonna make it. Almost. Her class is coming up. Dean kisses her cheek. Cindy settles, arranges her things. You have a good day? Anything good happen? Cindy shakes her head "no." She drops her keys into her purse, but they miss the target and she fumbles after them. Is something wrong? Cindy shakes her head. Takes the water from Dean. He stares at her. She concentrates on closing the clasp on her purse. Why don't you tell me? She doesn't want to start crying. Dean gets visibly frustrated. He's sick of prying everything out of her. Why do you gotta make me beg? I know there's something wrong. It's gonna come out eventually. Just tell me. The song ends. A patter of applause. The teacher introduces  the next song "THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC". That's great, where? Cindy doesn't answer. She can't. She tries to keep from crying. He quickly realizes what she's trying to tell him. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 8A. Where? I told you you gotta close that fucking gate. Cindy wipes tears. She has to look up and blink to keep them from rolling down her cheek. Dean puts his arm around her, holds her close. She tries to pull away. He won't let her. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 9. You were great. Did you find Megan? No. But... I was thinking... Maybe she got a job or something... You know? So she could make some money and buy some food. Or maybe she moved out to Hollywood to become a movie dog! Frankie nods. Dean gets her to the car. Straps her in. I was thinking...you should have some fun tonight1 Don't you think? Yeah! Cindy listens in the front seat. She doesn't approve. Pa! Jerry growls at Frankie. She screams, scared but delighted. A yapping dog named SAMMY jumps on her. Jerry nods at Dean who keeps his distance by the van. What? I can't smoke around his oxygen. Cindy gives Dean a slow look of contempt, grabs the backpack and walks toward the house. Jerry stands over the hose spigot with Frankie at his side. ...Want me to show you a magic trick? Here's how you turn the grass green. You can teach it to your dad. The sprinkler jets on. Cindy comes up and kisses her dad on the cheek. She straightens Frankie's ears. Wait...! OK...one, two, three GO! Frankie runs to Dean, dodging the water stream. She hugs his leg. He picks her up. Hey leopard. You be good now. You remember what to do when Pa snores? Cover his mouth and hold his nose. That's my girl. Gimme a squeezer. Dean hugs her and she squeezes back as hard as her arms allow. Dean plays as if his neck was being pinched off. He sets her on the ground running back to the porch. She gets caught in the diameter of the sprinkler spray. She screams as the water chases her. It got you! Go right! OTHER RIGHT! Dean and Cindy both laugh. Their eyes meet for the first time in days, maybe weeks. They exchange a brief smile, filled with mutual love, pride and respect - connected by their little girl. Frankie stands in front of Cindy, water drips from her bangs. I don't wanna take off my costume! Hey man... Can I have a slice of that pie? You're gonna have to speak with Mr. Saned, honey. Wait just a minute, okay. Dean sits on a chair, smooths his hair, smells his clothes. Normally we are busiest at the beginning of the month. You break your back for two weeks, you get 2 weeks to rest. That's normal. Days start early. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 12. Whoa whoa. You gonna break your neck homey. Look down. Dean does. All he sees is brown box. Can't see your feet. If you can't see your feet, how you gonna know where the step is? You goin' bust your ass. Curtis takes the boxes from Dean and demonstrates. Turn around. Curtis hefts the boxes on Dean's back. He pulls his arms around the back to hold onto them in an awkward position. You gotta be a mule. Always carry on your back. Give `er a try. Dean is unsure. He proceeds, imbalanced down the stairs. He makes it to the truck where Saned waits to help him get the boxes in. Dean can't quite manage a 30-pound, behind the back hand-off. He ends up spilling up the boxes and their contents all over the sidewalk. Saned gets pissed. Dean gets down on his hands and knees and packs up the boxes - quickly. Gonna happen to you someday too. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 14. I don't think that old man's been up here in 10 years. Saned elbows in with rolls of tape and contractor bags. It's fucking pee! - He runs to the toilet and pukes in to a shit stained porcelain bowl. Saned berates him for wasting time. How could you live like this? - He ties a bandana around his nose. Gets back to packing. - boxes full of the old man's life (religious items, framed pictures, old cameras and reams of polaroids). - Boxes are packed, taped and stacked. How we s'posed to fit all this in here? - Dean and Curtis move a dresser against the wall. - He hammers a nail in the wall. Places a framed picture up. - Unpacks the old man's clothes, folds them, puts them in drawers. - Replaces the light bulb on a burned out lamp. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 15. Last one. Lets get a move on. Gotta make it home for the game. Dean holds up the man's wedding picture. Look how handsome he was. What are you fucking queer? Saned hands Dean a wad of bills. Finish up, we gotta 2 hour drive back. Saned walks down the hall, calling out to hurry up. Dean sets the bills down on the dresser. Continues to arrange the things. He stares at a picture of old man and his wife. ELLIPSE - A nurse wheels Walter down the hallway and introduces him to his new room. Wait up. We gotta do this right... He takes the wheelchair from the nurse, wheels Walter out of the room, picks him out out of his wheelchair, and carries him back into the room across the threshold of his new home. You are gonna be the new stud in this  place. Dean sets him down in a recliner, then gives him a tour of his room - tells him which drawer his socks are in, where put the aftershave, etc. Curtis pokes his head around the corner. Boss says we gotta go. We gotta go. Dean cuts the tour short, wishes the old man luck and tells him he'll come visit him someday. He backs out of the doorway, grabs his money off the dresser, and says goodbye. Dean turns and is frozen in his tracks. Something or someone makes his expression change to that of wonder, eyes fill with love... he puts the money in his pocket. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 15A. We'll tell her Monday. After the weekend. Let's not ruin her Holiday.  Dean turns Cindy around, closes his eyes, and hugs her. You remember where we put... Cindy stops and watches him. He holds up a gift certificate in an old anniversary card. Here! Let's get the fuck out of here. Dean grabs the phone and dials. DEAN (on phone) (cont'd) Hello, I want to see if I can reserve a room for the night... tonight. I have a gift certificate but I don't know if it's still good. Can I give you a number? Taking us away. We gotta get outta this house. (Back to phone) It's still good? Good... Well, what rooms do you got?...Hold on a minute... Dean lowers the receiver to his neck. What room do you want? The North Pole, the Moon Room or Cupid's cave. Which one? Cindy shakes her head. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 17. I don't want to hear any excuses. We're going. We deserve it. One night. Because we belong to each other. Pick a room. You're not going to decide? I'll decide. That's how decisions get made. Dean gets a shit-eating grin. Come on let's go get drunk. He returns to the phone. Give us the moon room. Periera. P-E-R-I- E-R-A... 2... Great... Dean hangs up. Pack our bags. We're going to the moon! ...So, you been faithful to him? I'm a strange person. Cindy laughs. No seriously. Yes you have or yes you haven't? I'm not looking at you like anything. It's hard to be faithful. I don't know if monogamy is possible, especially if you're a man... This is Taylor. He's two. Got a little girl at home. Irene. Kids are great. They pick up on things so fast. Like watch... Hey Spence, give me five... Give me five, buddy. Drooling, and with a toothless smile, Taylor gives his daddy five. Bobby beams. Give Cindy five. Taylor holds up his hand limply so that Cindy has to give him an awkward five. Bobby laughs. They reach the register. To see yourself in your kid's face... I never experienced anything like that. How's your kid? No, you go... What's her name? That's $58.42. Cindy hands the CHECKER a fifty. The Checker holds it out. $58.42. $11.99. I got it. You can get me back. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 21. You're drivin'? Cindy hops in the driver's seat. Dean rides on the end of the buggy and crashes it into the buggy corral. She fires up the engine and honks. He throws his hands up. Alright, lead foot. It's not a race. Cindy is zoned into the road. She turns off the radio. Do you mind if I turn this back on? Let's just see if there's something on... He scans through the low stations. Anything? Fuck it. He turns it off. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 22. That's better. You're right. It never gets to be just quiet. You know? Cindy nods. Dean rolls down his window, spits his gum as far as he can. He rolls it back up. What are you thinking about? Dean looks at Cindy, waiting for her to respond. Did you get everything? Where d'you get these? Dean reaches for the glasses on top of Cindy's head. She feels the dangling tag - "woops." She tears off the tag and tosses the glasses on the dashboard. Try em' on. Cindy shakes her head "no." Dean puts them on his face. He poses for Cindy. She grabs the glasses and puts them on. She looks at Dean. He holds in a chuckle. You look like your mom. Cindy takes them off. Back on the dash. You get any snacks? Which bag? Mmm. These are good. He offers her another one. She shakes her head. You can't wait? We're almost there. Goddamnit Cindy!! Pay attention!!! On the side of the road, she stares into the woods. Cars pass behind her, headlights flood the night. She descends into the thicket until the sound of the highway is faint. Wind through the leaves. She drops her pants and pees. Something rustles and she looks into the woods. What are you doing? You're supposed to be a quadriplegic? Don't I give you enough attention? He presses himself into her and mauls her with a wet kiss. Wonder what people would think if they saw me making out with a paraplegic? He lifts her expensive necklace out from under her dress - looks at it admiringly. Then, Cindy. BOBBY (close (cont'd) Can you come over? Gimme a sec. Bobby tries to hide the erection trapped in his wrestling singlet. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 25. Get that fucking dog out of the kitchen! What'd you do to meatloaf? Huh?! Are you kidding me? How long does it take to make a meatloaf? Five minutes? You mean to tell me that you didn't have five minutes to make a meatloaf? I been up since six this morning busting my fucking ass and you don't have five minutes to make a meatloaf? Nice? Well, what gave you the idea that any of us needed a change? Did you ask for a change? Cindy? She doesn't ask for anything... She doesn't talk. You didn't ask for a change, did you mom?...She can't hear! And I don't remember asking for a change. So, it was you, wasn't it? You wanted a change. I work all day so you can sit on your fat ass, thinkin' about yourself. How you'd like a change. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 27. Sorry? What good is sorry now? I want you to enjoy your fucking dinner. He storms out of the dining room. Glenda, Cindy and Gramma sit in silence. Cindy takes a bite. Don't get my hair. I want you to think about that when we go into the next section. Please pass in your reports. Cindy passes her paper down. Bobby, the TA, collects the reports. Cindy can feel him staring at her as she packs her backpack. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 29. Shit. She stops moving, feels him shrinking inside of her. I couldn't help it. She gets out from underneath him. I couldn't help it... You felt too good. Cindy is white, tries to contain her terror. She disappears into the BATHROOM. Bobby sits up. BOBBY (calls out) (cont'd) Don't trip. It'll be OK...OK? Bobby lies back, frustrated, and buttons his pants. It's your fault. You felt too good. She sees her underwear lying by the base of the bed. She goes to grab them, but Bobby snatches them away. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 30. Say you're sorry! Cindy picks her pants up off the floor - pulls them on. I was just joking! God! You do. No, you do. I know that you do. And the reason that I know that you do is - I have stolen money before... a lot of it. And I know what it feels like to have someone look at you like that... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 30B. The way your lookin'. Just so you know, I have a job where I make money. Money that I can take girls out on dates with. Maybe... Can I give you my number or something. He feels inside his shirt pocket, pulls out a business card. Finds a pen. Dean writes his name across the card. Hands it to Cindy. DEAN (CONT'D) (cont'd) I'm Dean. Just call and you can ask for me. I'll get it. Cindy looks down at the card, at his name. Then back up to him. Dean run out, chasing after his ride. He looking behind before he leaves. Cindy watches him go out the door. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 31. Wow. Where are we? He sets down the suitcases, transfixed by the room, a kid in a candy shop. Cindy moves to the small kitchen that looks like a control room. She makes herself a drink. Cynthia! Now watch. He runs his hands through his hair then shows her his palms - three fallen hairs. His magic trick. See. I tol' ya. It's falling out! Cindy ignores Dean who is mesmerized. Oooooooooh shiiiiiiit! Cindy waves him away. Jerry picks up the line. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 32. Is that Francis? Hey!? Don't hang up until I talk to her! Are you ready to go to sleep now? I'll call you first thing in the morning, OK? He walks into the living room, stretching the phone cord, grabs the remote and turns on the television - animal doc. Dean turns the channel. Tennis. How much? CLICK. The news. ...Well, I love you more. Sleep tight. Dean hangs up and returns to the living room. He changes the station. A porno. He turns the volume down and watches. He hears water running in the BATHROOM. CLICK. A show on space. What are you doing? Do you like the place? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 34. I'm gonna go order dinner now. Any special requests? What does it look like I'm doing? I remember the first time I saw your back. Everything. He lowers his hands from her back to her behind. Cindy turns. I wasn't done. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 35. Getting thinner, isn't it? I know. I love you. She pecks him on the lips. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 36. I'll do it. Wait, I didn't wash your hair... We have neighbors. Cindy stands in a towel at the bar, waiting for the ice. Thanks. He takes a big drink, sifts through cassettes in his bag. In  the bedroom, Cindy buttons up one of Dean's big flannel shirts. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 37. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 38. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 38A. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 39. Hasn't anyone ever been nice to you? She takes the flowers, pushes Gramma into the house. The screen door closes between them. Don't make me give up on you... And instead of thinking about it you gotta just do something about it. Action, not thought. Anyone call for me? Dean peeks into Jo's office. She shakes her head "no." Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 40. Hi. I was looking for your neighbor... the man who moved in last month. Across the hall. Do you know what happened to him? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 41. What about the girl that was with you? Hi. I just had a long talk with your gramma... is that, is that your gramma? Cindy remembers him now - he's just dressed nicer - he doesn't look like a mover I was looking for that old guy who moved across the hall, you know? Do you know what happened to him? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 42. That's exactly what happened to my dog. My parents moved out of our house and three days later she was a goner. He pulls the locket out from behind his shirt. He unclasps it. Shows her the pictures. He was so handsome, wasn't he? I was trying to give it back to him. Cindy looks at it. She must have been crazy. Cause there's one thing I know... the prettier a girl is the more nuts she is. I mean, look at you... you must be insane. It's okay, I mean, I get it. It's not your fault. Cindy pulls the chain to stop the bus. Where you going? Can I walk with you? Cindy thinks about it. Just for a little bit... And when you don't want to walk with me no more, then just speed up. Doors to the bus open. Cindy thinks about it. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 43. Where's you house? Where? Do you think it would be okay if I looked in your purse? Why? Cindy thinks about it for a moment. Against her better judgement, she hands over her bag. It weighs a lot. Jeez... What you got in here? Lot of books. You doing good? What are you gonna be when you grow up? You going to be a doctor? Oh yeah? What should I do about this? He pretends to bump into a pole. Cindy laughs. Mmm. This is what you smell like? Cindy nods, "I guess so." I wanna smell like you. Can I? This is what your lips smell like? They must smell good. He puts some on his lips. Mmm. Your lips must taste good. No. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 45. What's in there? She takes her purse back. Why? Probably. I think I... I think I already did. It's okay. There's an early one. Until you get tired... Where'd you grow up? Here? Cindy gives him a grimace. Where do you want to go? I mean, if you could go anywhere.. They walk to an old playground. Cindy gets an idea. Oh God... I hate these things. What happened, tough guy? You gotta puke... it's the only way. She refuses. It's the only way. It will make you feel better. Don't be embarrassed. I'll do it. He sticks his finger down his throat and forces himself to vomit. The sound of it is too much for her. She gags. Side by side, they puke into the gravel. They finish their business and end up on their backs and out of breath, side by side, looking up at the stars. They are both covered in sweat. We see their breath. Me too. Yeah. We're flying. They laugh. Birds begin to awaken and fly. You should come visit me in the city sometime. The morning air chills their bodies. Dean takes off his jacket and uses it as a blanket. They get close together to get warm and watch the stars spin above them. To honesty... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 48. Hey! Wait up. How is it? Great. She's the best. Naw. She's the champ. She's the best parts of you and the best parts of me put together. Everyday she gets more and more amazing. Dean chews a bite of meat and washes it down with a shot of vodka. He refills both their glasses. She's not mine. I'm hers. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 49. I'm her father. She isn't there for me... I'm there for her. That's the way I look at it. It's the choice I made when she was born. Silence. They chew. Cindy stares through Dean. Like what? What am I supposed to want to do? I just wanna be with you. Silence. Cindy tries not to look disappointed. You look like an animal right now. Your eyes look like an animal. Like a bear's eyes. Yeah... You do. It's true. That's what you look like. Dean is amused but fearful. Cindy's confidence surges. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 50. Whatchu thinking about? Different? You think that's good that we're different? And that's the way you like it, don't you? You don't like me to bother you. Well there's not much space here. So I guess you won't be able to get away from me will ya? If you're not interested in hearing what I think I just won't say anything. OK. I'm going to say something. And what I'm about to say I've thought long and hard about. I'm the luckiest person alive because I'm living my dream - you, her, this, us, all of it. Cindy lifts up her empty wine glass to the light. What's wrong with that? That's the flavor. Eat it. My tits? I got tits? Dean opens his shirt and peers down at his chest. I could still kick yer ass. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 52. A dime and you're on. Cindy gulps more champagne. They scoot dishes out of the way and clasp hands in the middle of the table. I'm always ready, baby. Come on. Go! Start. Cindy ignores his taunts and pushes as hard as she can. Slowly, she begins to push Dean's hand down. Dean groans,  letting her win a little. Cindy presses down with all her weight. His hand is centimeters from hitting the table. Then, he turns the tide. Cindy battles back with all the strength  she can muster. Dean laughs, realizing her passion for victory. Dean pounds her hand into the table. He stands kisses his flexed bicep. Cindy lifts her hand. A fork is  stuck in the back of it. She looks at it with curiosity. Oh fuck. Hold still. He plucks the fork from her hand, leaving four vampire bites. You think we should rush you to the hospital before you bleed to death? Cindy shoots him a look. Dean wraps her hand with a dishrag. Does it hurt? Wait wait wait. He flicks the switch and the bed starts spinning. He runs out of the room. Cindy watches the room around her spin. Dean returns with the vodka bottle and two shot glasses. He kneels above her and pours them two shots. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 54. To numb the pain. Doctors orders. I'm an anesthesiologist. Drink up. We haven't gotten loaded together in years. He tops off her glass, refills his own, and quaffs it. I gotta take a piss. Don't fall asleep. He kisses her on the forehead, stumbles. Cindy hears Dean  urinating. She is sickened by it. She tries to set her full  glass on the floor that spins beneath her. The toilet flushes. The drink tips over. A loud crash comes from the BATHROOM. Cindy sits up. I fell over. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 55. Nope, I want you to come here first. I want you to laugh. Cindy opens the door and Dean scoots, making room for her. He lets out an "ow" before extending his hand. Come close. I want to hear you... I want to tell you... Shh, come here... Cindy reluctantly joins him on the bathroom floor. Their faces are close, eyes locked. You want to hear a joke? OK. What's better than winning a gold medal at the Special Olympics? Not being retarded. Cindy looks down. Hey...that's not funny? How come you don't think I'm funny any more? I tell you something funny. You laugh. I see you laugh. But you don't really laugh so much. You don't laugh anymore Cindy. No I want to make you laugh. Tears well up in her eyes. Dean rolls on top of her. He cups her face in his hands and stares long into her watery eyes. Hello... No, I'm just still in love with you. After a moment, their lips meet in an awkward rejuvenation. She moves her head away and pats Dean on the shoulder in a gesture of friendship. Dean kisses her neck. Do you... you want to have another baby? ... I want another child. Cindy bites her lip. He slides his hand between her legs. What!? I can't have sex with my wife!? Cindy covers her face with her hand. Do I repulse you that much? I'm good to you. I'm good to Frankie. I deserve a little affection. Do you want me to stop loving you? Do you want me to fuck other women? Do you want me to beat you? Is that what you think you deserve? Would that make it easier on you so you can treat me like this? Cindy raises her hips and slips off her panties. She lifts the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door jam. Her arm falls over her eyes. Breathless, Dean awkwardly moves one hand up and down her bodice. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 57. I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry... She looks at him. His head faces away. She rolls out from underneath and stands. She wraps her dress around her and slips into the bedroom. Yes. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 58. Sure. I don't know. Let me go check. Dean tiptoes over to Jake's room. Peeks in his door. Returns to the couch where Cindy is taking off her jacket. He crawls back under the sheet. DEAN (WHISPERS) (cont'd) He's just watching TV. They start to make out while listening for Jake. I don't know... Should I go see if he brushed his teeth? She nods. He throws off the sheet and goes into the bathroom, touches the bristles of Jake's tooth brush. Cindy takes off her socks and waits for Dean to return. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 59. Be quiet! Seriously. He's gonna kill me. He already hates me. Are you okay? Cindy nods. Is it mine? Cindy looks Dean in the eyes. You let that asshole knock you up? When'd this happen? What do you want to do? (after a pause) We'll keep it. We'll take care of it. Cindy nods. Silence. Do you want to take care of it? You can put your clothes on the chair. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 61. How are you doing? I'm going to have you lie up here, and put your feet in the stirrups. Cindy gets on the table, looks over at a tray of instruments. The Doctor pulls a mask up over her face - the vacuum aspirator on a wheeled base. Cindy focuses her gaze at the corrugated ceiling, dim light. Are you okay? I want you to try and relax. This is going to be a little cold. The Doctor inserts a speculum into Cindy's vagina. There, take a deep breath... What do you do? What are you studying? The Doctor dips a long swab into a solution, inserts it into her vagina. That's what I studied. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 62. This is a mild anesthetic for your cervix. You're going to feel a pinch and then it's going to feel like electricity. Cindy looks back up at the ceiling. She steady's her breath. Can you cough for me. Cindy coughs. Good... Why do you want to be a Doctor? Wheels move across the linoleum floor. The Doctor positions the vacuum aspirator. And what? Cindy, I'm going to begin the procedure. It won't take long. You may feel a little cramping. The Doctor turns on the vacuum. Panic flushes Cindy's face. Her eyes widen. You're not in this alone. This baby is ours. It's us. Let's start a family. Cynthia! No response. He struggles up and stumbles to the phone. Hello? A prerecorded message. Good morning. This is your...11:30 a.m...wake up call. OK. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 65. Was she with a guy? Like I said, I couldn't say. I just got here, so maybe she left before I came in. He types on the computer. And, she didn't check out. You're still booked until...Monday morning. 11 am. Is there anything else I can help you with sir? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 66. Hey faggot! Dean continues his work. Is your name Dean? Who's askin'? Bobby rushes him, throws a shoulder into his stomach. They both flail to the floor. The two lock. Everything is quick. Bobby sends a flurry of punches to Dean's ribs and guts. Dean pummels the back of Bobby's head with blind overhead rights. It becomes clear that Bobby has the upper hand. He holds Dean's bloodied head in some kind of jiujitsu headlock. Think I'm dumb? Think I'm that dumb? Dean struggles to breathe but manages to say... I think you're a fucking idiot. Bobby hits him again, harder. Harder. Fucking faggot! - Troy and Tony watch the door and egg Bobby on. - THE PHONE RINGS OFF THE HOOK in the EMPTY OFFICE. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 69. Stay away from her! Never. Bobby looks at his bloodied hands. He lacks the strength to lift he arms. Gives one last weak kick into Dean's bloodied face. Troy and Tony pull Bobby out. The gang leaves, victorious yet somehow defeated. The office phone, which has been ringing incessantly, stops. Dean is on the floor in the fetal position. It takes him a while, but he manages to sit up. He feels the inside of his split lip with his tongue. He doesn't feel pain as much as he feels tingling and ringing - all over. Jo comes in. She freezes when she sees him. Dean... Telephone. It takes Dean a while to get up, but he does. And it takes him a while to get to the office where his phone call awaits. Once there, he holds the receiver in his hand for a beat... Hello? Where's my wife? She hands him an in-patient form. Dean looks at it. I'm not sick. Mimi cups her hand over the phone. There's nothing wrong with me. Dean hands her back the clipboard. Where's my wife? Mimi lowers the phone. Cynthia. Where is she? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 75. Yeah, are you deaf or are you just dumb? She puts the phone on hold and disappears into the clinic. Dean turns around and looks at the people in the waiting room. He has a slight confrontation with a gang banger. Cindy approaches from the hallway. Saved you a trip. I got a ride. Mimi appears behind Cindy. - I was going out of my mind. I didn't know if there's an emergency. I didn't know if Francis was hurt. Did you think about that? Taking pictures? Mimi sits down at her desk and picks up a ringing phone. Last night got fucked up, OK? I know it. I know I'm lazy, I eat too much, I drink too much, I drive you crazy with all my jealous bullshit. I fuck up. I know I'm clumsy. But you're not trying anymore. Cindy hurls the bags into the back of the car. Dean helps. Please don't make me be alone. I'm OK. Yeah. Let's go. You don't think about anyone but yourself. Do you? Cindy walks back to the clinic. Dean follows close behind. You got no time for me anymore. It all goes to this fucking job. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 77. You! What about me? I gave up everything for you. Take what? What can't you take... The truth? I know you can't... You never could. Who is it? Wait a second... He grabs her in a hug. Her arms are pressed into her side. What the hell is going on!? Dean turns and takes a blind swing at Feinberg. One blow and Feinberg reels against the metal lockers. He hits the ground with a thud. His nose gushes blood. Dean paces around Feinberg like a caged animal. He pulls down a locker with his hand. It crashes to the floor. Cindy kneels over Feinberg. You're done. Leave. Dean jerks Cindy up off the floor. Get up. She hits Dean with a flurry of flailing fists. I know! He grabs the suitcase next to him and opens the door. He throws it through the air into a FIELD - trying rid himself of pain, longing, and desperation. He clutches his wedding ring, but can't yank it off of his fat finger. Finally, he gets it off and tosses it into the field. The moment he releases it, he wishes he hadn't. MOMENTS LATER - Dean and Cindy search for the ring. It is lost. Music begins to play in reverse. I didn't know if it was pot luck so I brought an eggplant. He points at his face. Behind Jerry, Cindy peeks out from the kitchen at the end of the hallway. It is the first time she has seen Dean since the fight. She is shocked. Face looks like an eggplant, don't it? How you doing sir, I'm Dean. Dean holds out his hand. Jerry looks Dean up and down. I stole these for you. No. It feels good. Keep doing it. She does and is interrupted by... The FAINT SOUND of her parents fighting downstairs. Maybe I should go. I'm going to miss my train. Okay. She kisses him. Opens up his shirt. Reveals a severely bruised torso. He winces a bit from the movement. She redresses his wounds, nursing him back to health. I love you. Really? Are your parent's gonna walk in on us? Daddy! Daddy! Mommy! Cindy's car sits in the driveway. Cindy gets out, grabs her suitcase. Jerry emerges from the house. Cindy kneels down and hugs Frankie. She is electricity in her arms. Hey sweetheart. Frankie leaps into Dean's arms. Cindy walks up to the house. She was good. Are you OK? Do you want to get out of my way. Jerry backs away. Dean walks past him into the house. I don't know what happened up there. But please Dean, come on. Don't push it. Let it be... Dean closes the screen door behind him and locks it. Jerry pulls on the door. Hey! You can't lock me out of my own house! Dean calls back. Keep an eye on Francis. I don't have my oxygen! Hey! Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 84. We're not alone here Cynthia. We have a little girl. We need to think about her. All you're thinking about is yourself. You. Francis is gonna grow up in a broken home and that's OK with you. Don't love each other? I've only ever loved you. Dean approaches her from behind. Reaches out... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 85. ...Cynthia...Cynthia... He holds her hands and gropes her arms, legs, shoulders whatever she will let him touch. Cindy has tears in her eyes but she is focused. There is nothing to say. I want to stay at Grampa's house next time for fifty nights. Dean looks up. He has tears in his eyes. Frankie touches one as it streams down his face. Why you crying? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 85A. Thank you... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 86. Daddy's gonna go now, OK. Dean stands and picks up Frankie. He walks to Cindy and hands her over. Daddy! Dean walks out the front door where he passes Jerry who stands on the porch. He moves across the lawn to the sidewalk. Vermillion light falls in the sky. Cindy sets Frankie down and she runs out the door. Jerry catches the little girl by the arm and holds her tight. Dean walks toward the horizon. FRANKIE (SCREAMS) (cont'd) Daddy! Dean stops and turns. Cindy walks to the porch. ... you may now kiss the bride. Dean and Cindy kiss. We hold on the kiss for as long as it takes. They stop kissing and look at each other in the eyes. Then, they start to hug. And hug... and hug... The title BLUE VALENTINE superimposes on top of the image. Credits start to scroll over...
