What...? What is this? Oh my God! Help me!! Help me!! Somebody help me! Please!! What is this? Come on, come on. What was it? No. Where the hell is it? Son of a...Come on! Help me! Please! Somebody help me! No! Wait! Hello? I'm buried. You have to help me. You have to help me, I can't breathe... I'm buried in a coffin. Please help me! Send someone to find me... Paul. Paul Conroy. I don't know. I'm in a coffin. I don't know where. I'm scared. Please help me. Ohio? Sheriff's Department? No...you don't underst... ...forget it. Come on, come on. Pick up. Please. Thanks for calling the Conroy's. We're not home right now. Please leave a message at the beep. Thanks. Linda, honey, it's me. Listen, I need you to contact the National Guard right away. Or the Pentagon. Tell them we were attacked in the Diyala Provence, in Baqubah. They have to find me. Please help me, baby. Please help them find me. Linda, it's Paul. I need you to call me right away. This is an absolute emergency. Call the number that comes up on your phone. Call me at that number. If I don't answer, call the Pentagon or the F.B.I. I don't know what the hell is going on, but I'm buried in a box... ...I can't breathe in here. Make sure you call me right away. Please, baby, please call me. What city and state, please? Um...I don't know. The F.B.I., wherever they are. Do you have a specific city you'd like to be connected to, sir? I don't care, any city. Just connect me to the F.B.I. Sir, I have F.B.I. field offices listed in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, New Haven, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver -- Anywhere! Any city, just connect me, please! I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not allowed to do that. Fine, um...Chicago. Okay? Please hold for your number. The number you requested, 312-421- Hello? Is this the F.B.I.? I'm calling from Iraq. I'm buried in the desert somewhere. I need you to help me -- Now. I'm there now. I'm a truck driver for CRT. I've been here for nine months. Paul Conroy. Alright. Me and a convoy of other drivers were delivering kitchen parts to a community center. As we got closer, a bunch of kids started throwing rocks at our trucks. Then an IED went off up ahead and blew up one of the other trucks. These guys came out from behind the houses with guns and started shooting everybody right there on the street. I don't know! (after a breath, calmer) I don't know. I was way in the back of the convoy. I must have got hit in the head with one of the rocks and got knocked out. That's the last thing I remember. But now I just woke up, and I was tied up and buried in a coffin. I guess whoever ambushed us. No, you're not listening. The kids threw the rocks at us, but then some Iraqi guys -- maybe insurgents, I don't fucking know -- popped out of nowhere and started shooting at us. They didn't, I don't know! But they shot them! I'm shouting because you're not listening! I need you to help me! Please!! Can you trace my call? GPS or something? I have no idea. They didn't, that's all I know. Why? Who cares? I'm buried in the middle of the fucking desert! Who cares what my social security number is?! I'm an American citizen. Just send someone to find me! Hello? What? I can't hear you. Hello?! Hello?! Shit!! Thank you for calling Crestin, Roland and Thomas. How may I direct your call? Somebody, I need to talk to someone right away. It's an emergency. Who is this, please? Paul Conroy. I'm a driver for you guys. I'm calling from Iraq. My convoy was attacked. Sir, if this is a crisis situation you need to contact the Safety Number your were provided. I know, I know, but I don't have it. They took it. Who took it, sir? The Iraqis, I think. I don't remember, I blacked out. I'm going to put you through to Alan Davenport. Davenport? Who's that? Director of Personnel. Please hold. Personnel? No, I need to talk -- At CRT, we work with our clients to provide effective and sustainable solutions to the challenges they face in our fast-growing, global economy. As the premiere... You've reached Alan Davenport, personnel director at Crestin, Roland and Thomas. Please leave your name and number at the tone and I will return your call as soon as possible. This is Paul Conroy, I'm from Hastings, Michigan. I'm a driver for CRT, and my convoy was ambushed...by insurgents or terrorists. I don't know. I don't know who it was. I'm stuck in the ground, buried in a coffin and I need help. Please send help. I'm begging you. I think I'm in Baqubah in the Diyala Provence. Please send help right away. I can't breathe in here. I can't...please. I'm begging you. I don't know who else to call. ...fuck. Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Hello? Who are you? Please, you have to help me. Who is this? Hello? Breathe no breathe, American? Ah? Breathe no breathe? What? I don't know what you're saying. Who is this? American can breathe no breathe? No, I can't breathe. Please get me out of here. Get out? Yes, please get me out. Help me. Soldier. No, no I'm not a soldier. I'm a truck driver. That's it. I'm not a soldier. I'm a contractor. Contractor? Yes, that's right. A contractor. Not a soldier. Blackwater. No, not for Blackwater. I'm not a security contractor. Truck driver, I'm a truck driver. That's all. You are American. Yes. Then you are soldier. No, I'm not. I'm here unarmed. But, you still shot at us. In head and in throat, so you tell no more lies. I'm not lying! We were all drivers. Drive what? Trucks. The big trucks you see driving around with the supplies? That's us. That's me. We're not soldiers. Five million money. What? Five million money tonight by nine PM or you stay. Buried like dog. Five million dollars? From who? Your family. My family doesn't have five million dollars. If they did, I wouldn't be here. From Embassy. I don't know, yes, the Embassy will pay you. If you let me go, they'll pay you the money. (after a long beat) Nine PM, five million money. Come on, what's her number? What city and listing, please? Hastings, Michigan. I'm looking for Donna Mitchell. I have two Donna Mitchells, sir. One on Federal Road and one on Ardmore Avenue. Ardmore Avenue...I think. Yeah. Shit, I don't know. Just give me that one. Ardmore Avenue? Yes, Ardmore Avenue. Please hold for your number. The number you requested, 269-948- 1998 can automatically be dialed for a charge of twenty-five cents by pressing the number one. Come on! Where the hell is everyone? Donna, it's Paul. Where's Linda? She's not answering her phone. I need to talk to her, I've been taken hostage by... Donna, I need to talk to Linda. It's an absolute emergency. Have her call me. Use star sixty-nine and find out the number I'm calling from and have her call me... Donna. I need to talk to Linda. Where is she? Are you near a computer or something? Turn it on. Look up the number for the State Department for me. Donna, please, please, please -- just get me the number. No! Everything is not alright! So, please, just look up the number. I'm not yelling! Just get me the fucking number!! Get me the number, get me the number!! Donna, I'm very sorry I yelled. But, I'm only going to ask you once more to get me this number. If you don't get me this number, I'm going to die. I don't have time to explain. Please...the number. I'm an American citizen, working in Iraq. I've been taken hostage. I need to speak to someone right away. From Iraq. I'm a truck driver for CRT -- Crestin, Roland and Thomas. We were attacked and now I'm being held for ransom. No. I'm buried somewhere. Yeah, in a coffin, a wooden box. It's an old coffin, I think. I don't have the number. I was given a number to call, a safety number. But the people took it. Yes. I don't know...hold on. Let me connect you...hold on. No. Wait... Hello? Yeah, my situation. I'm running out of time and you people keep putting me on hold. What the hell is wrong with you? Don't be sorry. Just help me. You've got to be kidding me. Wait, wait, wait...how did you know my name? I never gave you my name. I don't think I gave it to the other guy, either. What the hell is going on right now? Yeah...? Well, since you know what the hell is going on, what have you done to get me out of here? So, that's it? I'm just supposed to rot in here because there's little you can do? Then what? In the Diyala Provence. In Baqubah. Yes. The guy told me that he wants five million dollars by nine o'clock tonight. Or else he'll bring me to Sea World. What do you think, lady? So you'll pay them? Wait...what? To hell with that! It's easy for you to worry about policy, you're sitting in an air conditioned office somewhere, probably finishing up your sandwich from lunch. You're not the one stuck in a coffin, buried in the God damn desert! Frustration? Lady, I'm going to fucking die in here. Understand that! Hello? Well, then say something. Tell me how you're going to get me out of here. I don't know. Did it come up on your end? Go ahead. Who's that? Hostage Working Group? Situations. I love how you keep calling it that. Yeah. What about the news? I'm going to call them. Why? That's bullshit. You're just covering your ass. You don't go looking for something if you don't know it's missing. Fine. Brenner. Dan Brenner? Is this Paul Conroy? Yes, yes it's me. It's Paul. Paul, I was informed of what's going on. I want you to know that we're already working on trying to get you out of there. Oh, thank you, God. I was told that we have until 9pm. Is that right? That's what he said. Alright. That doesn't give us a whole lot of time. And just so I have this right, the kidnappers buried you in the ground? Yeah, in an old, wooden coffin. Okay. My guess is that since you're able to get a cell signal, you're no more than a few feet underground. I don't know. Maybe. What about battery life? How much does the phone have left? Less than half. Okay. You have to conserve that battery. Our best bet of finding you is by tracking your cell signal. Is the ringer set on a sound or vibrate? Vibrate. Press and hold down the asterisk key to change it to a ring tone. It will use less power. I didn't know it was going to be like this over here. I don't think any of us did. It's him. He's calling. The kidnapper? Yeah. What do I do? You know his number? Yeah. Give it to me. What about the call? Give me the number first. He's going to hang up. Take the call. Take the call. Now. Hello. Two hour, six minute. You have to give me more time. You talk to embassy? They give money? Yes. No. I talked to...someone. Government. They said that they won't pay the money. No pay? No. They said that they don't negotiate with terrorists. Terrorists? I am terrorist? Yes. You are terrorist, you son of a bitch. You are terrified, so I am terrorist? What did I ever do to you? Ever do? Yeah. I'm here because it's a job, to make money. That's it. I have job until you come. Now, my family have nothing. That's not my fault! Nine, one, one was not my fault, but still you are here! Saddam was not my fault, but still you are here! I told you, I'm only here to work. To help rebuild. Rebuild what you destroyed. Stop! Just please, stop! I'm just a guy. I'm just a truck driver. Okay? I'm nobody that makes decisions about anything. I just want to go home. You make video, ransom video. Yes. Please. Get me out of here and I'll make the video. No. You make video now. What...? How? You use video on phone. Near foot. You read note near foot in box. Where? I don't see -- Near foot. Read note inside box. The video...if I make it, will you let me go? Only if we get money. Nobody's going to pay five million dollars for me. We take less. One million money. If they pay it, will you let me go? (after a beat) One million money. Thanks for calling the Conroy's. We're not home right now. Please leave a message at the beep. Thanks. Shit. Paul? Here's his number... Hold on. Alright, go ahead. It's 07902-24-921. This is huge. Unless they're using a cloned line, we should be able to find where this is coming from in minutes. What about me? Can you track my cell signal? We're having a lot of trouble with yours. Seems to be an EDS line, probably through one of the Egyptian carriers. What does that mean? That...it's not going to be easy. He wants me to make a ransom video. No. Hold off for as long as you can. If it's going to get me out of here, I'm making it. The last thing we want is for this to end up all over Al Jazeera. We? This can't turn into an international incident. That's all you people care about! But what about me? Don't you care about me? We do. That's why we're -- No you don't! You people don't care about any of us. I've had eight friends killed out here, six of them today. We don't have any guns, any armor. Nothing. You're not soldiers. Tell that to the people who put me in this box! Tell that to the people who shot my friends! We're doing the best we can. No, you're not. All you people understand are your secret plans and your back room politics. If I were some diplomat or something, maybe even a hostage working group leader -- or whatever your fancy title is, I'd be out of here by now. Wouldn't I? But I'm not, so I'm just supposed to keep my mouth shut and die. I need you to stay focused, Paul. Fuck you. Paul, listen to me: finding you is our primary concern. Bottom line. And we're searching just as hard as we would be for a four-star general, so don't literally waste your breath suggesting otherwise. Who are they? The people who put me here? They're just that -- people. No different from you and me. I'm no terrorist. Neither are they. How do you know that? If you were homeless, starving...actually, I take that back. If your family was homeless and starving, what would you do for them? I wouldn't kill someone. How can you be sure? What difference does it make? They're criminals, desperate ones at that. They don't care about anything other than getting the money. So pay them, then. Trust me, if it was an option, I would do that in a heartbeat. How many others have there been? Since I got here? Hundreds. Journalists, contractors, soldiers...hundreds have been taken. It's one of the only functioning businesses out here. How many have you rescued? How many? Not many. Tell me their names. Who? Any of them. Make me know they really do matter to you. Mark White. Who was Mark White? A kid from New Hampshire. Twenty- six years old. Med student. Came over here to help out local doctors. What happened to him? Insurgents grabbed him. When? About three weeks ago. You remember his name. I remember all their names. (afraid to ask) Did he...? Is he...? Yeah. Yeah, Paul, he's alive. Where is he? Home. Probably happy to be back at school. I want to get out of here. We found him; we'll find you, too. How? We already have a solid lead on the number you gave us. You do? A unit's on it's way over there now. That's...that's good. Yeah. What should I do in the meantime? I know it's hard, but try to relax. The more worked up you are, the more air you're going to use. I can't help it. I'm always anxious. I take pills for it. Do you have them with you? Yeah. Take them. You need to preserve your oxygen level any way you can. Okay. Is your Zippo still lit. Not now. Good. I feel nauseous. You have to calm down. I'm trying. And you need to save that battery. We're expecting some intel in about ten minutes. Call me back then. Okay. Just hang in there, Paul. Yeah. I'm trying. What? Did you make video? No. You make video! Let me out and I'll make it. No! You make video now. In box. I can't. I can't read the paper. Make video now! I can't. I don't know what you want me to say. I can't read the paper. You make video now. I'm never getting out of here. I was hoping I could speak with Maryanne Conroy, please. Mom...it's Paul. It's Paul, Mom. Your son. It's okay, Mom. How are you? That's good. It's your son, Mom. It's Paulie. Yeah. Remember? We lived over on Colfax Street, in the duplex. Remember? That's right, Mom. It is, Mom. It's Paulie. How's everything at the home? Yeah...I don't think Pop's there with you, Mom. Not very good. This...uh, this may be the last time I talk to you. Did you get the flowers I sent a few months ago? Yeah, I sent...never mind. Listen, I...I'm going to go now. I just wanted to talk to you, you know, just to say bye. I love you, Mom. Did you hear me? Mom? I told you...do you want to tell me you (after a beat) Okay, Mom. Tell Pop I said hi. Oh no. No, no, no! Video make? Let her go. Please. Please don't hurt her. We shoot her if you no make video. No! No, please no shoot. No shoot her. You get money. American million. I will, I promise. Just don't shoot her. She's a mother, she's got two kids. Two kids? Yes. She has two kids. I have five. Now only one. You make video. Now!! Wait... No wait!! I give three seconds. I can't read the paper. Three... No. Wait! Two... I don't know what you want me to say! One. Okay! Okay, I'll make the video. Just, please, don't shoot. I need to hang up to make the video. Okay? Is that okay? You have three minute to send video. (re: the script) Fuck... (speaking at the phone) My name is Paul Conroy. I'm an American citizen from Hastings, Michigan. I'm a civilian truck driver for Crestin, Roland and Thomas. I've been taken hostage somewhere in Iraq...and I need one million dollars by nine o'clock tonight, Baghdad time, or else I'll be left to die in this coffin I'm buried in. I've been told that if... ...the money is paid, I will be let go. If it's not, I will die in here. These threats are real and will be followed through on. No, no, no!! (re: the phone screen) There you are. Linda, here's the number for the phone. I just found it out. It's 07902-42-884. You have to use the international calling code first. Please call me as soon as you get this. I love you...I love you. Call me right away. Please. Oh shit. Son of a... No! No, no, no!!! Why the hell did you make that video? It's all a bunch of lies. (after a beat) I spoke with soldiers from the third ID who were escorting your convoy. They're alive? Not all of them. Both Bradley tanks were hit with IEDs. The rest got caught in small arms fire. What the hell happened out there, Paul? Paul. We had just left Anaconda, everything seemed okay. We knew that a bunch of our CB radios had been stolen and that the Iraqis were listening in, so we made sure to switch from our usual channels. Pam was riding with Jeff Breer, the convoy commander. She wanted to ride with me like she usually did when she hitched a ride from base, but it seemed safer for her to be with the C.C. As we headed down the road, all these kids came running into the street. Dozens of them. It almost seemed like they were expecting us, except we got there faster than they thought we would. So they run on up in front of me, and I slam on my brakes. The rest of the drivers were already further up ahead, so they kept going. Next thing I know, one of the lead trucks got hit by an IED. I hear Tommy Wilkes on the radio saying, Sandman's hit, Sandman's hit. He's...he's everywhere. That's when the Iraqis came out of their mud huts from the side of the road and started shooting everybody. I couldn't believe what was happening. It seemed like slow- motion, like I was watching it on TV. People -- my friends -- were getting killed, and all I could do is watch. I didn't even notice that the kids were throwing bricks and rocks at me until one split my windshield. Sort of snapped me out of my trance. But then, I guess I got hit in the head with a rock, `cause I blacked out. Do you happen to remem...mo... nea... Oh no...no... This can't be happening. No. Come on. Please work. Hello? Hello? Who's there? Is this Paul Conroy? Yes. Yes, this is Paul. Who are you? Paul, my name's Alan Davenport, I'm the personnel director here at Crestin, Roland and Thomas. I left you a message. You did. I also heard from Rebecca Browning over at the State Department. Are you able to speak on the status of your situation? It's worse. There was an explosion or something. The coffin's breaking, there's sand pouring in from everywhere. I only have a half an hour before -- Okay, okay. Slow down. You should try to stay calm. Tell me something, Paul, who have you spoken to? The hostage takers, Dan Brenner from the hostage working group -- Okay, Paul. I'm with you. How about the media. I know your ransom video leaked, but have you spoken directly to anyone about what's going on? No. That's good. It needs to stay that way. It's important that we keep this situation as contained as possible. About three inches to my right, there's a wall. Three inches to my left, there's another wall. And about four inches above my head, there's a roof that's about to collapse and drown me in sand. I think this situation is pretty contained. I know you're upset -- Help me! Help me! What are you going to do to help me?! I know you're upset. And, from what I've been told, steps are being taken to get you out of there. So, hopefully it won't be much longer. Thank God. Yes, thank God. I'm going to switch on a recorder right now. Just a second... What...? Please answer the question. Shit. Mister Conroy? Yes. Yes! And do I have your permission to do so? Why do you need my permission? What is all this? I need you to answer yes or no, please. Yes. Alright? Yes! Thank you. Now, Mister Conroy, when were you hired by CRT? About nine months ago. Around January of 2005. Why are you wasting time with this? I have your official date of hire as January 4th, 2005. Is that correct? Who cares? This is fucking crazy -- January 4th, 2005. Is that correct? Yes! And during your initial training, before being sent to Iraq, were you made aware of the dangers inherent to the position for which you were hired. You mean when I came down there to Dallas and you guys said that all of the trucks would be armored and have bulletproof glass? You mean when you told us that things were safer than ever over here? Is that when I was made aware? I need you to answer yes or no, please. Yes. During that time, did you also receive and sign an employment contract with CRT, which thoroughly explained company policy as it pertained to your specific terms of employment? Yeah, I signed a bunch of things. Yes or no. Yes. I signed the contract. Yes! It's our understanding that you were taken hostage in Iraq two hours ago, is that also correct? Yes. That's completely correct. What is the point of all this? Our legal department requires that we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees, confirming that they understand the reasons for their forced separation from the company. As of this morning, your employment with CRT was officially terminated. Wait, wait, wait -- It was brought to our attention that you were engaging in relations with a fellow CRT employee -- Pamela Gorham. No. Wait -- Stipulated in your contract was a fraternization clause, in which it was stated quite clearly that any relationship, be it romantic or sexual in nature, deemed inappropriate by CRT senior officials is grounds for immediate termination. We...we were just friends. Our records indicate differently. This is bullshit. We're also legally required to inform you that because you were technically no longer under the employ of CRT at the time of your abduction, we cannot be held accountable for any injury that may befall upon you after your official date and time of termination. Therefore, in your case, that includes this incident or any consequences that may result from it. What about my insurance money? My family will need that money... Given that you were alive up until the time of your termination -- You son of a bitch. You can't do this. Do you understand everything -- You can't do this! Do you understand everything you've been told, Mister Conroy? Go to hell. That concludes our interview with Paul Conroy. I am now turning off the recorder. You people can't just wash your hands of this. You bastards put me here. I'm sorry. Come on... Answer the phone!! (desperate, exhausted) Why won't you answer?!! Paul, is that you? They're dead. How do you know that? I just do. Three F-16s levelled parts of the city a few minutes ago. I know. I felt it. Did they know I was here? (after a beat) Yeah. Did they care? These people that took me -- if they're dead, they can't tell you where I am. We can still try to track down your signal. You tried that already. We can try again. It's over, isn't it? No. Yeah. What should I do? I don't know. That's right -- just like everyone else on the planet, there are some things you know and some things you don't. I wish this could have gone differently. Yeah...me too. This is Paul Steven Conroy. Social Security number 048-32-1198, date of birth 3/19/68. This video will serve as my last will and testament. To my wife, Linda Conroy, I leave the seven hundred dollars in my personal savings and whatever I have left in my annuity. To my son, Shane Conroy, I...I don't know. I don't have anything else. My stuff, like, my clothes. I wish I had more...I wish I had done more. Your dad wasn't really much of anything, Shane, I'm sorry. Maybe if I was a famous baseball player, or a guy who wore a suit to work, I would have more to leave you. But, you can be one of those people if you want. You can be whatever you want. Just promise me that when you get older, you'll take good care of your mom. And promise me that you'll always try to do the right thing, no matter what. I love you very much, Shane. Maybe I never said that enough...maybe I did, I don't even know. That probably means I didn't. I'm sorry, Linda. I should have listened to you. You're not dead. Hello? Hello?! Where is money? I don't know. What don't know? I don't know where the money is. Liar! I'm not lying! I swear. Swear? I'm telling the truth. From Embassy, you get money now! I can't! You will!! I need more time. Please. No more time! There's sand pouring in here. I can't...it's everywhere. Please, let me out of here and I will get you the money. You show blood. What? You show blood, they give money. No. You cut off thumb finger, send video. I'm not doing that. Yes! No. No? That's right, no. You let me out of here, and I'll cut off my whole God damn hand if you want. You have wife? Yes, I do. And a son. A young son. I want to go home...to see them. Please, sir. Sir? Yes. Sir. I say that out of respect...to you. 243 East Walnut Street. Hastings, Michigan. U.S.A. That's my...why did you say that? You show blood...or they show blood. That's...you're lying. You're nobody...all of you. You can't get to them. No? No. You're peasants, criminals, that's all. You don't even know where Michigan is. Detroit. Ann Arbor. You looked at a map. That's all you did. You show blood, or they show blood. Send video by five minutes. Linda, listen to me: you and Shane have to go somewhere... anywhere. Don't stay at the house, whatever you do, do not stay at the house. The guy...the kidnapper, he knows our address. He stole my license and now he knows where we live. Go to the Sheriff's station if you have to, just don't go home. (re: the sand) Holy God. This is Daniel Brenner. Please leave a message at the tone. Brenner, where are you?! He's alive! He just called me! Call me right away! The fucking guy is still alive! They can't find them. They...can't. There's no way. Oh my God. Oh my God. Holy shit. He's down here! Get him out! Keep digging! Paul, we're here! Yeah? Paul, it's Brenner. Paul? Are you there? Paul? I'm...here. We're coming for you now. You hear me? We know where you are. You're coming? We are, Paul. We're almost there now. How do you know? Coalition forces picked up a Shiite insurgent just outside of Baghdad. Said he knew where an American was buried alive. He agreed to show us where if we let him go. You're coming for me? We're practically there already. You have to hurry. We are. No...you have to hurry. The sand...it's filling up fast. Just hang in there for three more minutes. This will all be over soon, I promise. Okay. I believe you. Thank you. Thank you. Three minutes. Try to -- I have to go! Paul, no -- Call me right back. Paul! Call me right back. Linda. It's me, sweetie. I'm...okay. It's going to be okay now. That's okay. It's all okay. They're getting me out. The people. Americans. They found out where I am and they're on their way to get me. It's all going to be okay. I'm okay. You're not. I love you, too. I'm sorry. I should have listened to you. I should have never come here. You were right. I'm sorry. I will. I will. I swear I will. They're here! They're calling me right now. I have to go. I will. I love you. I swear. I have to go. Move! Move! Let's go. Brenner? Paul? Paul? It's me. We're here! Corporal, get your men over here! He brought us right to you. (to the soldiers) Start digging! Let's go, let's go! You have to hurry.
