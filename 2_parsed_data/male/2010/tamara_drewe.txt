Pathological... `I've been wearing the wrong size all my life,' said Katie. `I was always popping out. Turns out I'm a 30GG,' she says. `Now my bras finally fit - though Simon prefers me without one.' Jody checks to see if her breasts have grown. She sighs. Frock horrors. This weeks top of the shocks goes to Katie Pound in an off the shoulder lime by Roberto. You wanna sack your stylist girl. In Ewedown? Nadia, what the ffff are you doing there? I haven't told her yet. I can't tell her just like that. It's twenty five years; a marriage. Of course I'm pleased... Nadia, go to the pub and stay there. I'll come when I can. Just give me a couple of hours - He ends the call just as Beth is nearing the door - panicking the phone back on to its holder. Cock pie. Beth opens the door to see Nicholas apparently hard at it. Good actually. Just about to embark on forensics. Reckon I might pack it in a bit early today. Need to think about my blood smears. Might take a drive; have a pint. Stir the old grey matter up. Judy. She says the Impala contracts should be through in a day or two. What? This is absolutely yummy. Yes but. What about the guests? But I'm supposed to be thinking, you know about the - Needs an expert yokel, does he? You OK? I'm supposed to be helping my mum up at Stonefield. Yeah. Is that - I mean - are you wearing that? Just looks a bit... hot. Now Beth knows she is right. She takes her jacket off, gutted. You know, Haddition's always packed with pissed Londonites on a Friday. I doubt we'll get a table anyway. Let's do it properly next week; make an occasion. I'm always taking you for granted. I'm vile I know; you should kick me really, but - He's about to leave. Beth speaks calmly. What? For a moment, he tries to find a lie. Oh come on, Beth. Look, it's nothing. It's been once or twice, that's all. Beth, it's not anything. Beth is raw with pain. Just a researcher with Radio 4. Nadia, Nadia Patel. This hits a nerve. No, no I met her when I was on Desert Island Discs. Just the name. Yes but - I was going to tell you but - Beth utters an inchoate cry. Beth, I'm a ruin, I know - but I've been in a real state about this... I didn't want to hurt you. Another wounded cry from Beth. Can we talk calmly about this? There are people out there - For God's sake; we're surrounded by Beth, we're like a pair of compasses... Joined solidly at the top but with the ends able to roam, in freedom - His phone beeps. We've talked a lot about the  creative mind and we agreed that it  needs freedom to explore! Calm yourself down! For heaven's sake. Beth... For a moment, she hopes he'll apologise. You're making fools of us both. Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the door and hurls it, roots and all. It's a direct hit. I was busy. Rowing with my wife. Home. We could have gone on just as we were. Yes. In London. Now and then. Nadia looks at him. The scales are beginning to fall. They get in the car. As they drive away, Tamara's car pulls up.  She gets out of the car and takes in the pub before entering. Bit of an atmosphere at Stonefield. Marriage. Remind me never to try it. No, `bout twenty years. Still strangers by local standards. Beth comes in, tense, anxious and haggard. Yeah, I owe her a lot. We'd say prick here actually. Or  wanker. That's good too. Shall we look at Ingrid? I can do that. Beth... Andy takes the shovel. Beth bites back tears. He won't last five minutes. Beth looks down embarrassed by (but grateful for) his support. (Into his phone) I told you. I love my wife. Don't ever phone me again. Glen is shocked by this duplicity. Beth... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Drove her back to London. Took all night. She was in a state. I'm sorry. Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms, holding each other. I don't know why I'm like this. I couldn't do without you. Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again. Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating. He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas releases Beth. She wipes her eyes. OK... Let's talk later. Has it? Me too. Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange. He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas' lies. Yeah, these girls are killing machines. They don't like Americans either. It's Winnards Farm. Lady there died a while back. Place is empty. Prob'ly just kids. Nothing to do round here except make trouble. Used to belong to my dad, this place. But it all went tits-up. Land was flogged to a consortium and the house was sold to Londoners; the Drewes. Was. Born in that room up there. He points up at the back bedroom window. Hey. This farm's mine, big nose. Hey, what're you doing? Tamara gives the alarm box a great whack. Who are you?? Tam?... Hardly recognise you.  Another whack. The noise becomes a high-pitched squeal. You won't do it that way. Used to do bits of work for your mum. Been keeping an eye on the place since she died. I do horticulture now. That's why you're back, to flog it? Make a nice second home for some banker wankers. Because sadly I'm still prey to the  economic forces that threw the peasant classes off the land. Tam. Their eyes meet. What the fuck have you done to yourself? Tamara's face falls. She's completely different. There isn't one. Was nothing. Decade ago. Just a  teenage thing. You should find someone you're in love with. You saying you love me, frosty tits? You say it; You're the girl. You've made it a wonderful home Beth. If you can't put this behind you, then we're stuck. What has to happen? I am sorry - Beth brings her arm up to push him away. Nicholas catches it; draws her to him. He kisses her insistently. Beth's resistance diminishes. Soon it has gone. We begin to see the depth of Beth's physical love for him. At that moment, Glen walks round the corner. He tries to backtrack, mortified by his intrusion on their passion. Too late. They part. Nicholas turns away in frustration. No. He's gay, you dobbin. Swipe. The drummer? OK. I'd do Ben. Yeah... me too. So has the muse shone on you, Greg? Oh yes. Of course we call them biscuits here. Well, Greg - I wouldn't presume to give an academic tips. Well. How do I do it? I just get on with it, Greg. To the muse, however you find her. Who's that? No it isn't. Good God. What's happened to her? She's completely different. Yes. Huh. Of course you won't. Because you're not desperate, are you? Always something a bit desperate about Tamara Drewe. Beth looks at him puzzled as he works on. I'm a pedigree loser. I had a graphics business; went bust. And then with my great business acumen I invested in a polytunnel full of ganja. Made a tit of myself. Spent about six years stoned out of my box and I'm only just getting it back together. Besides, even if I was the last man in the world, Tamara Drewe wouldn't have me. I dumped her. I was twenty. My mates thought I was cradle snatching... And they used to call her Beaky. Have you? What? Think it's time you went. You're making yourself ridiculous. Oh, grow up. Go on Ingrid; have some kids. She doesn't mind; it's like Lynx to her. If she's ready she'll stand for him, if not she won't. Refreshing basic. Darcy is up and at it. Thought you'd have gone back to London by now. We should go for a drink sometime, Tam. You know, for old times sake. You didn't smash it. It just bled. It can't be easy down there, Tam. All the memories and stuff. Your mum... OK it's bollocks - Of course you wouldn't want to fraternise with your gardener. I'll get it tomorrow. I'm on my way down to Winnards. Doing one or two jobs for Tamara. Just painting, decorating, sorting the garden. Beth is quite put out. I can easily do both. Sure, Beth. I won't rip you off. Tam? Got some colour charts for you to see. He sets out all the colours charts and plans he has been  working on. Tamara appears. She is dressed to kill. Well... I'd have this one. And then  upstairs in the bedroom - So what d'you have to do to get a cup of tea round here? Sorry people. I resign. Swipe is no more. Steve Culley is a cunt. Ben storms off the stage. The audience are in uproar. He's seeing Fran. I won't work with that tosser again. Steve! Don't! Steve is coming into the wings. He punches Ben. You fucking baby. Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name. Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara. What? Too right. They come here, drink our water, use our fields, they leave all their crap in our drains - Tamara's car sweeps past with the roof down. It is closely followed by a bright yellow Porsche. Ben is driving and his boxer dog, Boss, is in the passenger seat. Jody clocks him. What are you doing? That's Boss. You're not allergic are you? Everyone asks that. This your place? No, I want something else. Tamara grins. Jody and Casey arrive at the brow of the hill, breathless. They see Ben pin Tamara against the door. I seen her up at Stonefield. She's got a nose made of plastic. Wow... Jody is gutted; feeling the full injustice of her life. Yep. Maureen Tucker. Moe Tucker, with the Velvets. Five foot nothing. Used to stand up to play. Put the snare drum on its side and hit it with mallets. Mentalist. Everything you've ever heard about drummers is total shit. Only sometimes. She goes in to kiss him. But Ben grabs a pair of chopsticks from a utensils jar. He starts to play around Tamara, hitting the surfaces, the shelves and everything on them; a brilliant rhythm. He gets closer and closer. Tamara is utterly mesmerised. Ben stops. He still doesn't kiss her. Any more questions? Tamara is speechless. He kisses her. Hey, hey - who are you, mate - lost, are you? Andy strokes Boss. Tam? You want breakfast? Boss bounds inside and disappears. Andy is puzzled. He steps into the hall. Do you know about this dog, Tam - He notices two half-drunk beers. He wanders into the hall. He sees Ben's boots and most of Tamara's clothes, abandoned. The unmistakable moans of lovemaking are coming from Tamara's room. He turns on his heels, pained. How goes the opus? I simply pander to popular taste. Just airport fodder... Glen at the foot of the table, finds this modesty rich. The real secret of being a writer is learning how to lie. Because that's what storytellers are. Thieves and liars... Are you done yet? That poxy column? Can't it wait? Do it later. Play with me. Ben strums his guitar, determined to get her attention. She is such fun she's sexy And she lives on an old farm But something gnaws away at me It's causing me real harm. Tamara, what can you do with it? What can you do with her name? Its stands there lonely and rhymeless It's driving me nearly insane. Tamara the lovely, the ultimate, dazzling girl, Make me pasta carbonara, Cos I'm ravenous Tamara, Then shag me wearing your tiara... Tamara is delighted. She leaps on him. Can you let my dog in? Thanks mate. Jody and Casey watch from behind the hedge as Andy angrily goes to let the dog in. He must like kissing plastic. Is a fifteen year old from Ewedown. It'd be love, right? He doesn't strut; he's a drummer. He sits on his arse. Yep. Good. No way... We all need a bit of that, don't we. Fuck Soup. What's it look like? Whatever one you like. That's a nice one. Why not put it on that? He's pointing to her ring finger. Tamara is moved. Hello, Penny. How's tricks? Penny is suddenly all coy. You're looking great. Terrific coat. You look like royalty. It's saying hello I'm a ring. Will you marry me? Tamara looks at him, searchingly. What's up? The ring says I'm platinum with a long guarantee. So give me a reply. Tamara is grinning from ear to ear. Say what? The famous Ben - Swipe, eh? Swipe's over. Thought the whole world knew that. It wasn't on Newsnight, no. She said yes? Why's he on a chain? How'd you like to be chained up? They shoot him; I'll fucking shoot them. I think the word is gobshite. What's that supposed to mean? That is ten pence psychology! You don't know what you're talking about, do you?  He walks away. Beth is completely taken aback. `Mai Buff Orpingtons. Oh, the written word. That's what the country does to you; turns you into one. What's up? Yeah but I didn't know you then. So? It's yours now. She never wore it. She didn't want it. It was a gesture, OK, when she started seeing Steve. Backfired, anyway. Look, I love you now. Tamara doesn't believe him. She is devastated. It's not the ring that matters. I mean fuck the ring. It's just a consumerist piece of zinc. What matters is I want to marry you. Yeah. With my whole heart. And all the other stuff. Like my brain and my entrails and my whatever, pancreas. It all wants to marry you. He hugs her, starts kissing her but Tamara hardly responds. Uh huh. Beth is on her way out. She turns and kisses him. Look at that cellulite... `Her latest tattoo count was nine, including a Sumatran tiger and `Eternity' written in Sanskrit.' That Ryan... I think he's cute. Maybe. Wankers. Ben gives them a grin and a wave. Jody's heart soars. What if she's got an alarm? What if they come back? Is that Claire with an `i'? Beth has a tray of mince pies. Glen is at her side. What the fuck are we doing here? What am I - arm candy? Can we get out of here? In Field of Tares, you made Fred a corporal. But there's no such thing in the Royal Artillery. They call them bombardiers. Oh, thank you for that... So I hear. You have my heartiest commiserations, Tara. He hands her the book dismissively. Tamara is smarting. Omigod! A wild panic. They put things back where they found them. Why don't you sell it like you keep saying? You can write anywhere. Well it might be memory lane for you but it's doing my fucking head in. I want London. I want some Urban, OK? Are you with me or what? Cos I've had it with this place. Tamara is hurt - and deeply disappointed. It's drab. It's depressing. And every  time I look out of the window I see Andy's arse - what's that about? We're leaving. Thank God.  Andy looks at him. Tamara says you sell Christmas geese. Yep. Can I have one? Right now? Yeah. That one's spare. Is that a goose? You can take it now if you like. What? It's fucking alive. Oh, you want it from Tesco, all plucked and headless sitting on a bandage. How d'you do it then? Gently put it's head down there; then quick in the skull with an air rifle.  Pluck it while it's warm, little pot  to catch all the blood - Do you enjoy doing that? No, but in my low wage economy, this flock's worth a lot. You're a sick fuck, Andy. Grow up. I said grow up, little drummer boy. Ben thinks about it. He walks away. Glen appears with his suitcase on wheels containing most of his worldly goods. Tamara rang me this morning. Said  to finish the house. It goes on the  market in the spring and that's it; over. Come on. Or you'll miss that train. I like this. There's this bit right, where her dad takes her for dinner and she thinks it's some big treat but what he's doing, right, is telling her he's leaving them. And she, right, she's gutted and she yaks all her food into a napkin and puts it on his plate. It's painful. But funny. It's about her; Plastic Fantastic. She's sad, Jode. I recommend preserving it. Always useful, a good shed. I sent you that. Jody takes another swig from the bottle of wine. Is that theirs? No you are not! He'll think it's from Tamara, you dipshit. (amused, despite herself) Oh God, Jody... Look, there's that bloke my mum works for; Nicholas Hardiment. Uncle Andy. Don't ever, ever send that. You never! You'll spoil it! Jody - I love coming here and you'll spoil it! She'll know someone's read all her stuff! What the fuck is this? `I'll give you the biggest shagging of your life...' Explain it then. What's Fran got to do with it? Andy is outside his shed. It's OK, it's OK... The drumming leads up to a massive crescendo and stops. No problem. Have I? Are you thick? Isn't it obvious who sent it? That tosser Andy Cobb. Making himself all cosy in your house. Going through your stuff, prob'ly wearing your fucking pants - Bet it was him that nicked my black T-shirt. Well that says it all; the way you leap to his defence. You know what? I know Fran fucked my best friend but at least she was straight with me. Fuck's sake. What did you make of that email from Tamara? It don't make any sense. Her London  boyfriend's trying to fuck her up;  that's my theory. She could do so much better. How come she's with a different bloke every week and when Lesley Hunt's  sister shagged Jeff Dobson - just once, after he lied he loved her - she gets called a dirty slag. `Who's the daddy? Steve Culley and Fran Redmond recently announced they were expecting. But in a Valentine tryst shocker Fran is snapped with ex Ben Sergeant! Ben and Fran - we say Get A Room.' After that email, Jode. He's not up at Stonefield. Tamara is about to turn back. So what about this shag I've been  reading about? I liked your email. Very succint. Just not a traveller, Zoe. I'll probably stay on at the library for another hour or two. Yes... just checking some law reports. Hello. You can tell me to leave. Tamara says nothing. You can throw me right out. Nicholas slowly takes his red scarf and coat off. He hangs them on a coat hook, bringing himself closer to her. Just say and I'll go. She still can't speak. Nicholas takes her in his arms. He is  big and fatherly and comforting. Tamara feels a sense of relief, of not being alone. Her arms  go around him. When he kisses her, he's surprisingly real, vulnerable even, as if he's left his lordly persona at the door. Tamara closes her eyes. Their kisses become more urgent. Are you crying? Don't cry. Am I really that bad? Tamara shakes her head, glad of him. Yes you are. She looks up at him. You're relentlessly, rudely, uncompromisingly yourself. A smile appears on Tamara's face. Is that why you're crying? Am I here as revenge on your ex? Because... since you climbed over that stile in the summer I haven't  thought about very much else. She doesn't believe him. When can we do this again? Look, Beth and I have this kind of Bloody terrible. Didn't move till well past Chiswick. But look, I nipped into Fortnums... He hands her a package. Maybe I will... Nicholas goes to the table. The writers greet him as he sits. Sorry everybody; traffic was a pig. Do carry on... That sounds very innovative... Geoff. Henry James. That's right, a Hardy book. Coming well? Jolly good. Shush.  (Points at the screen)  This is brutally candid. You lay  yourself completely bare. Seriously. It's very moving.  Tamara knows this is praise indeed. She is deeply gratified. So... have I done my duty? Now do I get my treat? Tamara, almost in his arms, is crestfallen. Last time I saw Plastic she looked like a minger; all red-eyed and gutted. Ben's a Love Rat. She should move on... Jode. Don't say that. What if she's done something? Like taken a stack of pills? We see Jody's thought bubble of Tamara luridly dead, her mouth coated with dried froth and vomit. That'd be dire. Oh my God. What's Uncle Andy doing here?  Andy knocks. Arse biscuits. No answer... Oh no, I'm gonna chuck - And Uncle Andy'll find her by the  smell! Eurrrrr! Shhhhh!! Haven't seen you for a while. Thought you might be ill or something. Or depressed or - Come for a drink. Let's lighten up. Shake off the winter blues. Come  celebrate the spring. No way. Jody - he's my uncle. What's he doing here? Off-chance of what? Wait!! Casey is looking back at Tamara's door. Tamara is peering out. Nicholas joins her, putting his coat on. He kisses her passionately. He wants to stay. She's insisting he leaves. It's him. From Stonefield. `Prolific author of intelligent crime novels.' Maybe she's numbing the pain. Maybe older guys know more... you know, bed stuff. Jode, I know who I feel sorry for. Gutted for her. There'll be the divorce and like  acrimony and her world'll fall  apart... But maybe one day, she'll put the  bitterness behind her and find a  new love... See? That's D-List's car. Yeah. Dirty git. He's a rotten cheater. Shit salad. He gets out his phone. Jody and Casey are in the trees watching, satisfied. Yes, it's a frightful bore. You're a marvel. See you soon. Who cares? He kisses her, passionately. She is troubled but eventually responds. Jody nudges Casey. This is wrong, Jode. We should send the photo and be done with it. What? He's coming back. What're you doing?? No way, Jody! You're not sending it. You stupid cow! You gone too far! / You don't know when to stop! You're an idiot. I'm not having nothing to do with it. Jody shouts over her from /. You twat. You're a marvel. Cheers. He kisses her and prepares to leave. She is suspicious. Oh, don't. You hate festivals. It's completely boring. You'll hate it. Stay here. Her suspicion will stay silent no longer. Like what? Nicholas attacks; the best form of defence. God, it's like living with the effing moral police. Are you ever going to trust me? He goes. (getting her mobile out) Right. Wanker. It says number withheld. Couldn't tell you. I'm sorry Beth. You and Nicholas Hardiment. That's a nice piece of work isn't it? I get it from his point of view. He's always been a cheating wanker. He loves having his cake and eating it -  But since when did your standards drop so low? You could have anyone. All you have to do is bat your eyes. I care a lot about Beth. She helped me out when I was at rock bottom. I reckoned I could still see the  blazing girl you used to be. But now? I don't know who you are. That Jody? This is Ben Sergeant. So I'll meet you at Winnards Farm, four thirty. Ben zooms off. Cock pie. Has he told Beth? Well, I suppose it has to come out  sometime. It's a good thing. Feels like a  relief. Means you and I can start to  think about our plans. For the future... I know it's been hard, sharing me  with Beth. But I'm yours now. I'm  going to leave her. I want a new  life - and I want it now. With you.  Tamara is appalled. A minder interrupts. Mr Hardiment? It's time. It all runs very smoothly. I start a book in the summer, publish it the following spring. Bit of a factory,  really. So you've just finished `Like The Night', Inchcombe's seventeenth adventure. Are you already planning the next? There won't be a next one. Frankly  I'm sick to death of Inchcombe. In  fact, I'm about to kill him off. There's a gust of dismay in the crowd, as though a real death has been announced. That's a bombshell for your fans. (all for Tamara) Yes, but I'm moving on to fresh pastures. Inchcombe will be meeting a very sticky end. And it's one murder I'm really looking forward to. This might be a good moment to take a few questions. Yes, the lady in the apron... Madam, what a saucy question! Because she lets me. Beth takes this like a blow. Even Tamara is shocked by it. You're right. I can't go on using  her, lying to her. Won't be fun but I've got to do it. I don't feel alive with Beth! I haven't been living for years. She's  had me smothered in a comfy blanket - But... I'm in love with you. No. You can't end it. Tamara - Fuck supper! My God, you're cold hearted. You don't feel a thing, do you? There's someone else isn't there... Not that narcissist drummer? It's that ignorant lunk isn't it? That muscle-bound wastrel Andy Cobb. Thank you. Hello Jody... Dog minder? I guessed you might be the somebody who's been getting in here, pissing about, sending e-mails and fucking people up. D'you know  what I'm saying? You've been breaking in. What key? Well for fuck's sake. Did you nick my T-shirt? Creeping about in our stuff? What gives you the right? What stuff? So that's nice. Least someone does. D'you still love me, Jody? Even though I wanna lock you up in a young offenders institution? Jody nods, unsure. What would you do for me then? Would you do anything, like a proper fan? Jody looks at him, scared. She manages a nod. Ben approaches her. Let's see then shall we? We see Jody's phone flashing on the bed. Ben's dog. It's here. Means Ben must be -  Casey suddenly realises where Jody is. The dog runs off up  the street. Casey sets off towards Winnards, full of  apprehension. Excuse me. May I speak with my wife? It's over. Beth - I finished it. She's been  chasing me; this wild crush - There's something desperate about  her, something almost unhinged - Beth...Don't. You can't. Right. Now put two sugars in and stir it. OK. That's a decent cup. Which is lucky Jody cos if it had been shit, I'd be on the phone to the extremely scary local cops right now. I knew it was boring round here but for fuck's sake... Aim high, that's what I say. Tamara. You've had an infestation. Jody. Jody, shamefaced, prepares to cough up. Oy! Greg! I want a a word with you. You fucking devious bastard. You think I haven't noticed how you've been worming your way in?  You keep your hands off my wife,  you low-rent pedant. I want you out of my house. And I fucking pay for it. I've  given Beth all this. What can you  give her? Obscure literary shit not worth ten Beth'll come to her senses. You need an income to run Stonefield. And mine's bigger than yours! Jody has explained that she did it out of deep love for me. To Ben's astonishment, Tamara smiles. He grabs his moment. Tamara...  It's an apology. Tamara takes Ben's hand and leads him  through to a dresser in the hall. She opens it. Jody - the dog! Tamara... Andy is watching. She turns away from him. He approaches. Tam, come on. It was an accident. I'd better get up to Stonefield. Come with me. We'll get this sorted. Then get Ben to take you to London.  Make sure he looks after you. Tamara walks a few paces away. She stares straight ahead. What are you doing? Glen can't look him in the eye. You can't run away. Beth is asking for you. She's on her own over there. Glen, she doesn't need a writer around the place. She needs a man. Kind of suits you. And I always did like the old one. They are in each others arms. The embrace lasts and lasts. Tamara is leading Andy up to the house. What? Been dying to get rid of you. This is my house. I was born in that room.
