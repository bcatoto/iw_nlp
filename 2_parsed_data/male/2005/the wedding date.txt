Last night? Does Kat know? I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey. Your probably best off pretending you�re asleep. You�d better get going. My parents will be �round to cart you off to the country. Yeah. You heading to the train station? I look like a total wanker, don�t I? Don�t be ridiculous. It�s late and the place is empty. Just take my car. Fair enough, but I�m stepping on toes here and you�re waltzing around like... I thought you said you were crap. I think I love you, mate. How do you know so much about so much? Just because some slag�s been paid for, doesn�t mean you�ve got to...you know. You are taking the piss? Who�s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly? Doesn�t look like nothing. And you do now? Oh, shut up. You�re an optician. But, somehow, it was Kat�s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf. Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot. No. Other than, he�s shagging your exgirlfriend? What?Nothing. I didn�t deserve her back then. Lasik surgeon, actually. That�s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor. And Kat was fully clothed. It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake. Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing. No, that�s not it. There�s something about him that�s just a bit odd. What�s his problem? Sorry, can you give us a moment? You Yanks and your therapy. It�s great. It�s all a bit too touchy-feely for me. Nothing, nothing. Crikey. Ah, a philosopher. Oh, hello. I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That�s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it. I slept with your sister. Brilliant. Bollocks, I�m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult. You�re not even listening. It�s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It�s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don�t know. You see, I thought I could deny my feelings-- Well, we had a lot of good years, but then... Right. Seven. Christ, that�s a long time, isn�t it? You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years? I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know. It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here. Kat, stop it. You do. You can�t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up. Kat, wait. I don�t want you hating me. We�ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this. Is that why you brought him? Because of me. Kat, we must talk. This guy, there�s something not quite right. I have regrets. Let me guess. Amy presumed I�d forget the rings. I think I�m her least favorite person. You know, I am sorry. Hey, Kat. Seeing you again.... Hello, Katmandu.Or Kat.... Still-- Actually, I do. To make sure you�re okay. Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me. It�s not me. I swear. It�s her. She�s magic. I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow. Yeah, kind of. I�ll just check into a hotel. I had to say something to get you here. I�m a hooker. It�s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute. You did the right thing. Um, just about everyone. No, I can�t. We�re late for a dance lesson. I guess you�ll have to finish up later. Hey, man. No, tell me. What? Shrink, actually. Hey. Nice speech. I thought it was �touching�... and �funny.� I have to. I�m the best man. I should go. Hi. Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you�ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship. You�re judging me?! Oh, that�s a good one. You�re lying to me, you�re lying to your family, and you�re lying to yourself. But you�re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend? Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, we�ll go back to the real world and...and you�ll be hiring me for your best friend! Besides, you hired me for my discretion. So what�s with the nickname? And that�s when he peed in his pants? After the tart? Fourteen and he�s hoodwinked by a an erector set? Yeah. You? What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think? Make out with you for free. There was something in your voice on the phone that day. When I said I�d never done a wedding before, I didn�t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes. Sure, but it�s never easy. They say they�re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they�re not. It�s my job. You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn�t one of them. I just hate seeing you so stuck. Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It�s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you�re not walking away! Yup. That�s why you get to keep your money. Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you. No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me. Not dollars. Pounds. Don�t they have a limit at those machines? If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that. Is this for last night? We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out. I�ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it�s the words: �morally repugnant.� It�s hard to explain. I disappear. It�s not about me. I swear. I don�t have a signature move. Don�t stop asking questions, okay? I love that you�re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this? There�s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours. Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them? What do you think? Are you asking me if I�m gay for pay? When you�re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then.... Yes. First of all, it�s never out of the blue. And second of all-- Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved. I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me. Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn�t be violated. The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath. Would you grab my shampoo? Your �friend� guaranteed my anonymity. How did you know that was me? This happened to you? That�s right. Imagine facing it alone. Not the way you�re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that. A weekend? You stand on your tiptoes. It�s cute. Who are they? You quitting? It�s okay. Hell, I�ve never paid for it. But please don�t feel like you have to explain yourself to me. Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens. On the nose. I tell you what, because you�re so cute, I�ll take care of our incidentals. Why? You�re too good for him. I don�t know. He was pretty drunk, but I think he�s still crazy about you. Love. The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog? You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they�re naked. Both. Mmm. Mission accomplished. You�re funny. What color are my shoes? You think we look like we�re trying too hard. Kat. Will do. --and The ass of The man who adores her. I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them. What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation�s most precious resource: your daughter. I am now, sir. I�m guessing MacCallum, 18 years. Neat, with a water-back.You want me to let him in? You want I nut him in the boat? You pawned it. The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back? I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You�re here for the highland flings, I bet.I�m so sorry. Oh, no. He told you. Like fifteen. What�s he do anyway? I wasn�t saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself. Sure. You�ve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think you�re easy. Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven�t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.Then for once in your life, do something for yourself. Oh, well, then. It probably won�t work out. So why�d you let him go? Ahoy! Hi, kiddo. Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party? Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass-- What do you say to that? What is it you do again? At least somebody�s using the damn thing. I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again. Is there any other way to take it?Hard. I always wondered what happened with us. Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain. �Not yet...� Just drunk enough.
