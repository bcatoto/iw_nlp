Under the Manhattan Bridge. I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen. Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud. Ruptured steam pipe. We must abandon. Very bad today. You are going where? Big mess every time. I opened thousands of brains. I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding. Where you're going, mister?Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent. Say it again. This is a great young out-of-work actress. Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables. She was very evasive. About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who. Paisley Porter. Keep going west. Last building before the river. The American theater doesn't need people like that. There are things that speak to us from the past. `The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.' I'm telling you as a friend. He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow. It's your best play, Nicky. We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack? No, we're not. That was a big mistake. Where is it? Then you should carry a gun. What about the haircut? Where are you going? The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist. I'm not ready. You say we go? I think we Nought to wait. Is it safe? I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me. Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca? I recite it to myself with masochistic relish. Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review. Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers. That's what I said eighteen months ago. It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous. You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears. Shit. They don't have any carrot soup. Tonight you find out what it means to suffer. What do I exude? I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute. Do not inhale. Asbestos lining. Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts? But didn't we know it would happen? That sounds so final. But are we really surprised? Don't talk like that. How is Lillian? I haven't seen her. Press a button and they give us money. Quietly effective. A lovely piece of theater. Small but important. Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.Did you see the winning run score? What are we talking about? I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend. Unbelievable.This could be it. Does it feel comfortable? This could be it. This could be it. This could Pbe it. Let's work on it. This could be it.Life is true. This could be it! You're hurting my head. What did it say? Washed away. People are dependable. Life is good. Great game. Red Sox are winning. What's it like to shoot somebody? What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?Show him who we are. So what are you going to do about it? You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand. You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon. I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here. `Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here. I lost it. I lose everything. I can't find it. My back is killing me. Since when did that matter? Don't make me sit through one of your plays. But the son is suppose to stop crying. It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things. The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees. They're only gonna lose. You know the answer to that. Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle. Get yourself something to eat. It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in. Where does Nicky get his hair cut? If it's you, what are you doing here? Nicky comes on Sunday's. What do you want? Where the hell are you? Go way. I'll call a cop. Who is it?That's where I peed. I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel. I never left the garage without my Windex. Do not inhale. We must abandon. What do you mean, we must abandon? Crosstown. I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs. I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds. What did you find? Very big. I used to drive a taxi. Had to be him. What do you mean? How do you Eknow. Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live? Shoot him. What? We were thinking of putting in a pool. He'll hate it. In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives. I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life. We're making too much of this. I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now. I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab. He carries a gun. Don't wait Efor me. I don't have the problems that artists have. Here we go. Do not inhale. I say we go. Do we care? What was it like? A year and a half later? You're still brooding? That's awful. And he was there? What happened eighteen months ago? What's the fuss? I don't get it. It's just a review. You mean because What's-His-Name. Tonight. What's tonight? Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread. You used to love life. You don't exude this any more. I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful. We must abandon. Very dangerous. Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do. I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen. It's over, finished and done with. She wants a divorce. Ride with me. We need a haircut. You're an artist. I'm a craftsman. Shut up, Elliot. I don't want to hear about it. You're not making sense. Make sense. Of course I saw it. Yes. What are you implying? What are you talking about? Classic. Great game. They'll lose because they're my team. It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity. The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night? We don't even like each other, do we? In and out of bed. This is how we've managed to last. Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old. The Red Sox They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening. Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy. About what? I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems. Can he get through it? Our Peter? I talked to her two days ago. She's dying. You know about Adele. I hear Alan's sick. I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor. There's nothing left for me to lie about. Everything. I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk. Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around. Can we talk later? Will you be at the party? And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk. Take it yourself. Take a date. Opening night? Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked. This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you. Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom? Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend. You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive. Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology. I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this. If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent? And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets? Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying? That's completely crazy. Why do you need a radio? What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this? Do you want to get some coffee? I never see you anymore. Where are you all day? I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you. We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal. It was an animal thing. No real intimacy. I am really, deeply sorry. I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman. Alma Wetzel. I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this? There may be things you'd rather not know about. Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other. I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked. You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw. And you've been extremely patient. The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me. Opening night, Lillian. Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning. I'll have whatever she's having. How prominent? All right. What's been going on? We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us. Two-all after six. Life is real. This could be it! A thousand things. It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night. One more out. All the failures, all the fatalism. I don't know if I can say that. Life is good. They're always winning. Until they lose. I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions. This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall. What do you want me to do? I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from. Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that. I think the building's okay. At least for the time being. I know, Pop. I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it. You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble. Where's your elastic brace? Let's not start that again. Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think. You'll need these. Tonight. For the play. I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer. It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember. Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week. Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand? I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's. Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?' We must have been heroic. It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms. Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker. I'm on my way to get a haircut. Where are your glasses? Go get them. It's me. Nicky. Right here. At the door. Pop, will you let me in? I'm at the door. This could be it! It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley. Because life is good. All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter. He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed. This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why. I don't know. Life is good. I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments. I want to believe. "It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day." Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work. It's a complicated subject. I don't know Toyota. What does he do? Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it? It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work. That's my cousin, Angelo. Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question. What am I doing? Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball. Now that's a complicated subject. It's the kid's lucky day. A grandmother. God bless you. How come you got the kid with you? Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere. Some little kid stole the hubcaps. Oh yeah? Everybody else does. Why not you? And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand? What about my play? I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror. If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night. I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler? No. They're not your team. They're my team. Why do you care? Why does it matter? I've had three straight washouts, Sidney. Postpone. We have every right. 'm not worried about this kid. hat was this morning. appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play. aybe we ought to postpone the opening. You're not making sense. Eleventh inning. What else? Have to hurry back. When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate. I hate the Mets. Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth". Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter. Why? What do you mean? This could be it. And the Father replies? Yes. Yes. Mine was cobalt blue. What was your favorite color crayon, growing up? You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen. Yes, Peter. Yes. Yes. Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer. Sidney remains optimistic. I'm actually beginning to enjoy this. Yes. What? Come on, Paisley. Yes. I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy. So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm. There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven? Someone waiting for you? Where are you going now? I don't know. But you're his friend. He wears a disguise. Is it true? I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed. Would you like to meet him? So do I. Over and over. I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world. You keep slipping away. How do you do that? One more time. You know what. Say it again. Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike. Endearing. And he has finer moments now and then. Oh. You know him. So does Elliot. There was a review. You've worked with Elliot? What's good?This could be it. Does what feel comfortable? This could be it. This could be it. This could be it. Let's work on it. This could be it. I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it. That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it. I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love. I kissed her while she was laughing. This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it. Burnt sienna. What color? But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines. I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth. I have excellent long-term memory. I was educated by nuns. Sidney.Game six is history,pal. Hurry back. Hurry back to what? How come?You're dangling from the last letter of your last name. Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater. Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts. So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews? I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said. Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense. An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before. I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work. It's your best play, Nicky. Am I really so deeply repugnant? Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking? What's sexy? Mystery. Deception. We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty. This building is not secure. If you're wondering about the firearm. What else? What else? First you tell me. Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this. It's only our first date. You're out of bullets. When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates. Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore. The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one. They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.' They're my team. If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over. Then they lost? Stay. Teach me to be compassionate. And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me. The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims. Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs. But you're here. So you must have come to me. You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a -- Yessiree, Bob. Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business. To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
