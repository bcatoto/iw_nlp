Well, what are we gonna do about it now? Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer. Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes. What about Starks? Then don't. I'm fine. I didn't put you in Alpine Grove. I don't understand... How did you come to know their names? The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove. It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be... Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get... Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names... I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out. I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer... No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it. You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital. How...how are you here? [Beat] You're his son? Who are you? You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug. Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to. I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks. I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off. You killed him? Yes. And what's that? Temporarily. It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year. Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about. Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks! Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of. I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather. I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey... You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition. [Pointedly] Of course you're not. Relax. Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is. We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to. In where? Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious? He's recovering on the third floor. It's not my job to believe you. You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct? I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable? Well, your condition's pretty serious.I never touched your father! I swear! I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it. I thought you said you never knew your father. Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me... Oh yeah, what'd he say? Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right? That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son. Do I know you from somewhere?No, it hasn't. I can't take you out of here in your condition... [Beat] What do you need me to do? Sure. You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago. Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you. No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more. I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.Just do it. Jackie, go play in the snow. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it... Jackie, get in the car. NOW! Get your fucking hands off my daughter!I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this. [Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3. Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"? You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something. 'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women! It's gonna be sticky. Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think... [Beat] How do you know? Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level. I know you need one when it's really cold. I wasn't talking about anything. Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean. I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that. I tried to kill my wife. TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie. That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket. I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it? You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker. No, we were patients. So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out? Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer? How? I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there. I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know. I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you? No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing. I think you know. Your eyes say you do. Becker, how do you sleep at night? And what does that mean? You sure you know where to find one? Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison. My business? They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh? That's too bad. Long live the Organization for the Organized! We are not birds of a feather. I don't give a shit about your patient! I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light. Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer. Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here. That wasn't a fucking restraint. [Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket. I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there. Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic! [Beat] You don't believe me, do you? Depends on what you're seeing. [Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What? He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it. I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death? That's too bad. My father used to talk about you. Did you know my father? He didn't either. You may have known my father, William Starks. Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs. And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided. I need to get this letter to someone. [Beat] Thank you. This is really happening, isn't it? Good. You done with your small talk? I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams. What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries? What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think. His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died? I'm doing fine. I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive. I think so. [Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie. Good. How's your mom? Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick. You gotta stop thinking like that. When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address? Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her. What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker? Where are we going? If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face. No, he didn't. [Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is. They've got lives to be grateful for. Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it? Then why isn't there anyone around? I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it? There're no cars on this street. They're not. You're sure? Me, too. I might not be able to. Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days. I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say. I don't know. Why? Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died. I have no idea. I don't believe a thing she just said. How? Did they figure it out after I died? I didn't kill Officer Harrison. If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net? I know. Yes. Do you really believe me? What? After I... Yeah. I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around. It's December 25th, 1993 today. How'd he die? I gave you my dog tags. How? [Beat] What? [Beat] What? I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you. No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital. Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it. [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me. I think I can remember what's on them. [Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are. Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification. Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel. Hey, can you reach the gas pedal? [Beat] What's your name? Your mom take anything before this happened? You two ok? Good. You know how to get there? You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him. I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up. You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it. He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly. Listen to me. That's all I ask. No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene... You still don't believe me, do you? Can I get some paper and something to write with. Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me? Who...who kills me? I did? How...how do you know? NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me! Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true. You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me. Because of the future. I know what's going to happen. I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it. Because I don't have time. Maybe. I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life. No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from. It doesn't look all that different. 2004. [Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket. Come on. Tell me what you do know. I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember? This has nothing to do with that. You don't understand. Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place. You have no idea what's going on. I'll die either way. [Beat] We will. Exactly. [Beat] Yeah, it is. Why would we do that? My dad wrote some things down before he died. Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea? But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was... [Beat] I don't know. How'd he get it? What case? You thought my father was crazy? Why? I never knew my father. Did you? Believe me, I know. No. I don't want it to. I could try to...make it stop. Why, what would you do? No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind. That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did. Because I don't think I'm crazy. And if I didn't want to come? Becker does? Are you sure? MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy? Is it true? So what am I supposed to do? Why? No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days. The Jacket. [Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die. [Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die. Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods... What were you talking about the other day? Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy. Don't you go to jail for that? Yeah, guess so. How'd you know? Sure. Where are you going? I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it... No. That when you stopped being a nurse? I'm sorry. How? Yeah. [Beat] How about you? I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either. They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split. But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember? This is a great song. You don't think that's crazy? [Beat] Why? I don't know, but I think part of it's... [Beat] Why'd you stop? Have you always been a waitress? You like it? So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing. Thanks. Sure. I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if... The best I could do with what was in your fridge. [Beat] Yeah, I'm fine. No, I'm ok. I'll manage. Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far. No. [Beat] Not around here. No. [Beat] I was dropped off. Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either. Why "of course"? I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know. I don't think so. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. [Beat] Thanks. [Beat] I'm not deaf.
