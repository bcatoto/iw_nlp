I don't think you should... I got shells too, box and a half, tops. Well, it don't look pretty. Her fella. Nah, I got the gun. Yeah. We shot a skunk. Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile? Who the hell would you call? Gonna stay for a couple? Well, your last words can be "I told you so." You got something better? Wha? Oh! Come on, come on. Upstairs. I think I know where a CB is. Hey! Get quiet or get out. You seem mighty collected about this. I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first. Shit! In the corner, behind the curtain. You all sure about this? This is a bottleneck waiting to happen. What!? I'm not going down there again! It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there. There's a tunnel. Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke. They're right here. Well, justice is funny. So, your husband ditched you? And the head? And the rest of 'em? Just an observation. What? I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles. No. You? Get in line! You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.We're lucky to be alive. Stop it. Anyone. I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here. One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry. My truck. Come on! We're better off. Well then I guess we should just give up. Oh yeah? You weren't helpin'. Fuck no. So, what now? Did those things leave? Your parents of relation? Your brother, huh? Why do you take shit from him? Just cover me. It was built to move. Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back. Nothing, this was my last delivery. My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here. Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here. We gotta be close. We gotta try. I'm in.With what just happened upstairs -- I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge. But it's got teeth. My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!? IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU? IS IT CLEAR?! Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising. You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this. How much I got, what? Sure. The girl's got rhythm. I can't feel a thing, Hon. It's much safer in there, sweety. Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there. No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time. Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue. It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm. Magic potion. You should try a little. Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue. Push and twist, it's child proof. Well... I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible. What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck! Seven. Seven. Holds four. Covered. Two. Fully. Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever. Nothing. Huh? What? Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point. In the kitchen, under the sink. The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts. Huh? So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside? Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense. What? Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?You gotta be with me on this. We'll be food, dickheads! If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all. OPEN THE DOOR! "OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean? Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps. Where's that? C'mon guys-- What now, Geronimo? He's dead. Who's with me? Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner. Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie? I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it. Go douche. Any more ideas Animal Planet? Why don't you go check it out? What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon. They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy. I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew. Oh? And what's that? Whoa! What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh? Blow the goddamn hatch! What the hell's going on here!? No bullshit. Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do? You smell like ass! Welcome back. Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!? Yeah, maybe. HELLLLLLLLP!! SHIT. REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--! JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY! I'm fine! I'm fine! You keep that key handy. No shit. What?! Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs? What? Gimme the keys. Duh hickey. Got 'cha! OH JESUS! Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose. Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together. Amazing you made it this far. BONSAI! I'm sure. You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.Let's wait it out. DON'T! She's not very nice, is she? What's wrong? Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?I'll go with ya. I wouldn't do that, son. Sit still, look less like a meal. You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy. This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep. Get outta here.We lived near power lines. Yep. Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera. HELLLPPP! Am I too heavy for you? I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good. HELP MEEE! You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself? That's an unwise thing to say, you know that? Look. Ohhh. The door... on three. Of course not. I fight monsters all the time. Scared? Fuck you too. Clear! Clever fuckers. Bullshit. Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride. They were all over the place. F-f-fuck you. GO-GO-GO!! Not without you!!! If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them. Let's go! Whoa! There's a rifle and a shotgun here. So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks. And the last one is the...What have you done now, broke the darn thing? You know that no one likes a liar, right? What did we say about lying? Are you lying to me? Do you have a note to corroborate these claims? Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
