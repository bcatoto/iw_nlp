Seventy-five, right?  For the half-hour. And, typically, the size of the tip is... Of course. No.  I've done this before. Lorna thinks otherwise.  She pats the seat next to her. I don't know.  Another fifty dollars? It pays the rent. Well, somebody thinks so.  I get a lot of work. You have a great smile, do you know that? And I like your name.  Lorna.  Like the cookie. Hey, I'm not afraid of sick images.  In fact, it's what I aspire  to do, create pictures that are edgy, that really assault you,  that reach out and slap you in the face. Well...I don't know.  Shake people out of their...complacency. Uh-huh. Maybe that's the point. What do you like? Me, neither.  Marriage, it's so...medieval.  Sometimes when I'm  doing a wedding I look at the bride and groom and think, "What  a couple of lemmings." Right.  That, too. Lorna puts down the photos. Yeah...was it? Really. Nothing.  Are you alright? You never said anything about cab fare. No.  I swear, you didn't say a word about it. Lorna slowly brings the phone to her ear. You haven't told me where we're going yet. Can I ask you a question? (without a beat) No, forget it...it's stupid. Well, after we...after we did it, you didn't really mean what  you said, did you?  About me being so good. (back-peddling) I'm only asking because I'm fascinated by this whole scene you're  in.  So, don't worry about sparing my feelings or anything.   I'm just curious. What? Right...Well, that's what I thought.  I mean, a guy would have  to be pretty lame to think that... Nothing. Quite out of the blue, she leans over and kisses him on the cheek. Yeah. If I wanted to see you again-- Lorna!  Lorna! But Lorna is gone. (to the couple) Beautiful, just beautiful. (to Todd) You used a rubber, I hope. Of course. And how much did this afternoon delight set you back? Oh.  About a buck and a quarter. (to the couple) We just need to reload. As they do-- Since when do you have a hundred and twenty-five dollars to throw  away? I'm sure you spend just as much on porn rentals. There's no comparison.  Here, I'll do the math for you. Phil pulls a calculator out of his camera bag. PHIL (CONT'D) (cont'd) (punching in numbers) A video rents for $2.65.  That's a two-day rental.  That means  you can get off at least a couple times before it's due.  $125  divided by $2.65 equals approximately 47.  47 X 2 = 94.  I can  get off ninety-four times for the same amount you paid to get  off once.  Now tell me who gets the better deal. You're right.  I can't argue with that. Anyway, I stopped watching porno. You did?  Why? They kinda depress me. (beat) When I want to get off now, you know what I use? What? Phil taps his forehead. My imagination. (to the couple) Okay, folks.  It's magic time. What's Sarah got to do with it? You're seeing her, aren't you? Sarah...that's a whole different situation. But you're doing it with her, right? I like Sarah a lot.  And I don't want to blow it by pushing too  hard. You mean, you haven't... Technically?  No. She won't put out? No, no, no.  You don't get it.  You can't equate the two.  What  I did with Lorna-- Lorna? That's her name.  Lorna.  I mean, that's the name she gave me.  person is like?  What that world is like?  I was just...doing  research.  The lower depths... I didn't say anything. That's alright.  I hear it's really overrated.  And long. Done what? He's your boss.  Being an asshole is part of the job description. Do what? Sarah.  Take a breath. Now, take another one. Not today. Shopping?  For what? (completely thrown) Just what I was thinking. Something...somebody left in front the studio.  I just picked  it up. What are you doing? Stupid of me...I should've left it. No. You have a perverse mind. (beat) ...which I like, by the way. Maybe you should put it back. Sarah...I don't know how to put this.  This is our fourth night  out, and I feel a lot of pressure...for this to work. Don't you think we're being a little...methodical about the whole  thing?  Maybe we should just... Not exactly. You can trust me. Of course not. I told you.  I'm not. Beat. Is that bad? What?  You should be flattered I don't ask.  I respect you enough  to assume you'd tell me if you're involved with someone. Are you serious? (off her look) Alright.  Are you seeing anyone? I'm just worried that all this talk is going to kill the spontaneity-- Okay. Beat. I wasn't going to say anything. You look beautiful-- What happened? A bunion Oh, a foot spasm.  Here let me-- He throws back the covers and massages her foot. What can we do? She has a better-looking body than I imagined...Breasts are definitely  bigger than I thought.  You can just never tell with breasts,  can you?...I don't know what to make of this foot problem...Maybe  she gets a spasm every time she has sex...I've heard of people  with problems like that...People who can't have sex without laughing,  or burping...Oh, God, what if she's one of them... The thought never crossed my mind. She won't look at me.  Why won't she look at me?..I'll bet she's  preoccupied with her foot.  She's praying she won't get another  spasm, another foot freak-out...She's being awfully quiet, too...Why  is she so quiet?...Maybe she needs to concentrate...Some women  need to concentrate...I read that in a magazine at the grocery  store...That blonde check-out girl who works there is really  cute...I love the way she says, "Paper or plastic?"... What's the matter? Is that why you're so quiet? It's hard for me to tell if you're enjoying this. That's not what I...Sarah, I just want to make sure I'm doing  something right here. I know.  I just want to make sure I'm...you know, in the ballpark. You didn't like it. A myth.  You're right. I agree. And at the end of the day, sex is only one part of the picture. I know this couple. They had nothing in common but good sex.  it lasted?  A month.  They were hot for each other...but there  was nothing else. Don't pay her any mind, Sarah.  The things she says, they get  stranger by the day. To tell you the truth, no.  I just wanted to hear your voice. Alright, what do you think of it? What are they going to think?  That's all that matters. You haven't met these women. Sarah laughs, catches herself and stops. The champagne order? Invitations? Good. He reaches behind her and pats her butt. I can't. I love it when you're full of contempt. She just glares. I've got a better idea. Why don't I distribute a memo, informing everyone that you and  I are not sleeping together? Alright, alright.  I have another idea. Let's just end it. Beat. Coming? You don't want it work out, that's what you're saying. You want your pickle? You know what the problem is?  The first night we went out, we  should've just fucked.  Right away.  Without thinking.  Two dumb  bunnies.  Without any history,  any baggage.  A pair of blank  slates.  Fucking.  It could've been perfectly meaningless.  You  want chemistry?  The less you think, the better the chemistry. The least you can do is give me your goddam pickle. They look away from each other.  Todd eats in silence.  The pickle  sits between them. Wait. (beat) About the other day...Are you having any second thoughts? You're angry I called it quits, aren't you?  You can admit it. For what? Touchï¿½. No.  I say, let's make a clean break.  Let's just walk away from  it. What are you doing? Alright.  Now that we've put that behind us, there's one problem  left. Where do we put the bed? Josh gestures to the empty room.  Sarah smiles -- it's a familiar  game. Wrong.  It's got to go here.  So you can see the hallway. They head out. As Josh and Sarah leave the house, they "decorate" several rooms. Why do you assume there will be two children? I prefer to eat out. Where would you put it? What? ...and linger.  They both know what's happening. And that would be...? You're very clever. She rubs his chest. With Sarah's back against the door, Josh enters her. She looks up.  With no roof above them, she has a brilliant view  of...the clouds.  They float past as she thinks-- I have to tell you, that was the best "break-up" sex I've ever  had. (into phone) No, no, no.  You don't understand.  I don't want an appointment,  I just need to get in touch with her...She left a package here  by mistake, a gift...No, I'd rather give it to her myself...Lorna,  but I assume none of you use your real names...What?  But she  was working last week?...And you don't have a forwarding number?  so-- Dammit. He dials again.  Then, a knock at the door.  Todd reacts -- he's  not expecting anyone. Sarah... Pickles.  Huh. (beat) What's in your hair? She touches her hair. Yes, I have a problem.  I need some...something to cover up a...Hell,  just take a look. I can do without the attitude, thank-you. (impatient) But what do I do with it? What? If it's stupid, why read it? Yeah.  She's a bore. Some poor tree gave its life so we could know that. Why? Is this going to be one of those nights? One of those nights we talk. I've been under a lot of stress. How's that? He turns off the side light.  We can't see them -- the room is  completely dark. I can feel that. I can't. To seduce...to be seduced, there needs to be an element of surprise.  surprise? What? That makes no sense. And, what?  Pretend I don't know you? THE GRADUATE is about a married woman having an affair with a  college boy. Gwen, THE GRADUATE is a story about a very unhappy woman who  has an affair out of wedlock.  As I recall, it turns out rather  badly for her. Actors pretend.  That's what they do.  I'm not an actor.  And  I love you the way you are. Pretending to be strangers is not going to solve the problem. Through the crowd he spots Sarah, entering with her date -- Todd. I don't ask her about her personal life. Sarah and Todd arrive. Sarah's told me a lot about you. Josh is not sure how to take that. But fair. Todd. Especially after two glasses of champagne. Living together?  No. Sarah and Todd both laugh. (to Sarah) She loves to embarrass me. I was broke. I know it.  Used to be a cool dive.  Now it's ultra-hip and overpriced. Gwen loves to dissect our first date. Gwen, why don't you continue your stroll down memory lane while  I drink?  Todd, you up for it? Sure. They move away toward-- (to bartender) Gin.  Straight up.  Olives. (Todd) What are you having? I'm fine, thanks. So...Sarah's an attractive girl. Very. You two serious? (shrugs) Hard to say. She wants to play the field, right? No, that's not it. I see.  You want to fuck around. Todd reacts. C'mon, we're guys.  I know the drill. Todd considers his audience, then decides to open up-- We dated a few times, and to be honest, I was on the fence about  Sarah.  I liked her, but I didn't think we were in a good groove. I didn't know. (beat) She didn't say a thing about it. It wasn't unexpected, but Sarah took it really hard.  So where  did that leave me?  I was ambivalent about things, right?  But  then my ambivalence had to take a back seat.  I had to be there  for her.  Completely.  And, ready or not, our relationship became...a  real relationship. You know, I wasn't ready to be that involved with anybody.  I  don't know...Death has a funny way of making you get outside  yourself. Gwen is still chatting with Sarah.  Gwen makes eye contact with  Josh and sends him a warm smile. I know. Somewhere we need to go first. Yes, we do. She peers in the window. That's okay.  We're different, too. I don't want to talk about Sarah. I want to talk about me... A beat. ...and what a fool I've been. Gwen is not prepared for this. I thought if we came here tonight we could...start again. (brightens) The fortune cookies haven't changed. He brings over the plate. I can't wait.  I have to know. He opens the first. (reading) "You are on the verge of success"...in bed. Gwen laughs, opens one herself. (reading) "You are very creative"...in bed. The last cookie.  Go ahead. It's blank. (checks both sides) I got a blank. No, it's perfect.  Blank...no problems, no history, nothing...in  bed. By the way, I didn't get your name. Well, Gail, I'm not usually this forward on a first date, may  I take you to my car and ravish you? What's that? Oh, I thought everyone knew my name.  I'm Bill Gates.  Billionaire. People are jealous. What do you think I'm doing? (beat) The fortune cookie said you're on the verge of success...in bed. You shouldn't read fortune cookies too literally. Josh swings Gwen onto his lap.  They go at each other like...a  couple of college kids. As he makes love to his wife, he thinks-- ...Can anyone see us?...Is anyone looking?...Why should it bother  you?  You're alone...with your wife...That's the way it's supposed  to be...You know every inch of her...every smell...every sigh...every  freckle...the shape of her ass...the mole under her nipple...the  whole history of her body...And, you know that if you really  concentrate, you can succeed...in imagining...she's someone you  don't know... Gwen, this is David Warren.  Hopefully, a welcome voice from  your past.  My show's on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend. I have no idea what you're up to...I hope life is treating you  well.  I heard through a friend of a friend of a friend that  you're still married.  Congratulations.  If you want, give me  a call.  I'm crashing at my sister's.  The number is -- hold  on-- the number is 235-4511.  Hope to hear from you. ...on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend.  Are you free for  coffee...or something? You're right.  We could use some more color in the living room. I said you're right. About more color in the living room. And how many nights will you be staying with us? We do have a two-night minimum. That won't be a problem.  We just need a credit card imprint  for your incidentals... ...which we tear up when you check out. Gwen smiles. Will you be needing more than one key? I'm still reeling.  It was the most humbling experience of my  life.  Getting raked over the coals by a bunch of sixteen-year  old drama students!  At my own alma mater! They were, with knives drawn. Basically, why am I working on a piece of shit like MALIBU NIGHTS  when I should be doing Shakespeare or Chekhov? Compliments from the table in the corner. The Waiter gestures.  David and Gwen turn.  In the corner three  middle-aged women are smiling. Gwen.  You look great.  You haven't changed a bit. Those women!  Walking boob jobs.  They're appalling. It's very simple.  I close my eyes and imagine I'm kissing someone  else. Yes. Here, take a look... He hands her a photo.  In it, we see David standing with a distinguished  man in his mid-40s.  With them is a smiling boy, about eleven. What's wrong with this picture, huh? She smiles. Andy.  My partner.  And the best thing that's ever happened to  me. Eric.  He's Andy's son from a marriage that -- needless to say  -- didn't work.  Andy came out when Eric was just five.  Great  kid. Come out?  About fifteen years ago. (off Gwen's look) Is this too much information? You and me. No, you were fantastic.  I was completely confused. Gwen quickly gulps down some champagne. What's the matter? Why? Beat. I'm listening. Oh. Uh-huh. Married. Happily. Can I help you, ma'am? Gwen looks lost. Are you okay? Was there a problem? I'm sorry.  We won't charge you for the room. Yes.  I do. (beat) More than you might think. Gwen stares at him. Shall I close out the account? You're in luck.  I was just about to take my break. Something from the mini-bar? How's the air conditioning? Shall I pull down the covers? Do you want to know my name? You're shaking. I don't care. You're right. That's where you're wrong. He begins to unbutton her blouse.  Without touching.  Without  affection.  After a beat, she begins to unbutton his shirt. (to the Maid) Buenas tardes, seï¿½ora. Your welcome. And they ride in silence. In Gwen's mind-- David. No.  What's so funny? There's a woman waiting to see you.  She's been here for half  an hour. Why are you here? Don't you have more important things to do?  Picking flowers,  honeymoon reservations... (into phone) Front desk, David speaking...No, sir.  Tap water is very drinkable  in this city...Of course, sir.  We'll send up some bottled water  right away. What's wrong with here? But here, I won't be tempted to raise my voice or do something  rash.  That's the first lesson of hotel management.  Never lose  your cool, no matter how annoying the guest is.  Not that I plan  to go into hotel management.  I don't have ambitions in that  direction.  Or any direction, if I recall you correctly. (into phone) Front desk, David speaking...Yes, ma'am, the restaurant has a  smoking section...Well, I didn't make the policy...If it's any  consolation, the smokers are seated in a little corner of the  patio, and they feel very bad about themselves. Rosie, you'd better leave.  Before I get myself fired. She starts to protest.  Thinks better of it, and exits. Yo, fiddler on the roof. David reacts -- this is the last person he wants to deal with. (regards the violin) Wish I could play an instrument.  Chicks really dig that stuff. Discipline.  Always a struggle. I hear you.  For instance, it takes a certain discipline to know  that when you're working at the hotel, when you're on the clock... It won't happen again. Good. David marches away. Jesus! She simply picks up where they left off-- No. I lied. Because what?  Because you're getting married? Beat. Rosie, I want you to be happy.  I do.  And someday, we'll be  friends.  Someday, we'll all go out to dinner.  The four of us. Sure.  Me, you, Jerry, and whatever pale imitation of you I can  dig up to be my date. And the check will come and Jerry will pick up the tab and I'll  protest, but not too much.  Then, you'll give me a kiss on the  cheek, and some dim memory will stir in me, but not for too long.  to see you... We've  got a few more things to cover.  The photos.  There's  a courtyard behind the church.  It's a popular backdrop.  Our  photographer says the light is gorgeous.  We need twenty minutes  before the ceremony for singles. I know.  It is an election year. Exactly what he said. Right.  The guest list.  We have a few more no-show's. She consults a list. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett send their regrets.  Also, Ms. Rothman will  no be attending. He's not? After all that shit you put me through, now he's not even coming. So, if there are any last-minute-- (ignores her) I guess that means you've been talking with him. Take your time. Rosalie gets up and leads Jerry into-- What? When did you decide this? What did he say? I want to know. Of course he was.  He's still in love with you. Thank-you. (into phone) What do you want, Rose? Yes.  I was. Rosalie -- on her cell -- waves to him from the sidewalk, three  stories below. I don't write 'em, Rose. (beat) Is our conversation over now? No. She laughs mischievously. No. (beat) Stay there.  I'll be right...Wait a minute.  This is insane. You do that. Rosalie sits on the front steps.  Stubborn. (to himself) Be my guest.  Sit there all night. David turns from the window.  He accidentally knocks his metronome  to the floor, setting it off.  Click...click...click... If I go down those stairs...it will only lead to one place...right  back here...the two of us...a short, brilliant moment...one more  to add to the gallery...then, empty-handed again, with nothing  to show for it but an emotional hangover...I'm not going to open  this door... Discipline... Like the man said, don't fuck the  guests... I've got nothing to say to you. Rose... This is bullshit.  I can't spell it out any more plainly.  It's  impossible! Because I can't be this close to you...and not want to touch  you. That's...it. And he does touch her.  He puts his hand on her leg. And if I can't do that, I don't want to be your friend.  Not  now.  Not ever. The bottom line is...If I'm with you, I have to touch you, to  kiss you.  That doesn't work for friends, does it? When I'm not with you -- this is more than you need to know...If  I touch myself, I can only think about one person. You.  No one  else.  Just you. What do you mean "we"?  This is your problem. (beat) My only problem is how to get you out of my mind.  How to erase  you...Delete every bit of you... You have to say good-bye. Should we stop? Rosalie is too choked up to answer -- she shakes her head "no." She nudges him.  He doesn't stir.  Rosalie sits at the foot of  the bed.  She grabs the remote and "un-mutes" the sound. ...And the change is not just physical.  You'll be amazed how  quickly your whole outlook will-- Hey... What time is it? It is late.  What happened? What? Okay...why now? What's the matter? You're forgetting something. Don't you think... If you're ready, so am I. She straddles him, rocking back and forth.  With grim determination. What? A lot of young couples prefer "husband and wife" to the traditional  "man and wife."  Personally, I don't feel the phrase "man and  wife" gives the woman a diminutive status.  But I leave the choice  in your hands.  Do you have a-- Good. (to Jerry) After the blessing, I'll instruct you to kiss the bride.  Keep  it simple.  No slobbering. Remember, this is God's house.  And there will be prominent people  here as well.  Not to mention the press.  So, let's keep things  on the up-and-up. Here we are.  Bahia Gold.  Two hundred a box. You don't have to do this, Dad. If I can't come to the bachelor party, I want to be there in  spirit. Thank-you. I remember my bachelor night.  Frankly, I wish I didn't.  Not  a night I'm particularly proud of...I'll leave it at that. Why are you sharing this? Reminiscing.  That's all. Or warning me. Nonsense.  I know you.  You won't make an ass out of yourself. What's this? It's a key. (smiles) There's a new housing development, just west of here.  I've been  giving the developer a lot of breaks, and...now he's giving me  one in return.  I'm almost embarrassed to say how little this  cost me. I can't accept this. Yes, you can. (beat) C'mon.  Make your old man happy. Jerry says nothing. Uh-huh.  I get it.  This is Rosalie's domain.  She should have  a say in where you two settle down.  But don't worry, you won't  be forcing her hand.  Know why?  Because she's going to love  it. Let's ring these babies up. Alright, my man.  You ready? Do I have a choice? No. Then, I'm ready. The guys pitched in for this... He pats Jerry on the back. So go up there and get our money's worth. Jerry starts up-- Why am I stopping?...There's a hot girl waiting on the other  side of the door...Why worry?  Everyone cuts you slack for this  kind of thing...This is supposed to happen...It's a tradition,  a time-honored ritual...Losing your tooth, losing your virginity,  losing the championship...If I walk through this door, what am  I losing?  Nothing...My father was here, and his father was here,  and his father's father was here, hand on the door...What am  I waiting for... Did they also tell you I don't usually do this kind of thing. Yes, I am. Yes.  Tomorrow, I take the vows. Without much ceremony, she starts massaging his crotch. How's that? You sound like my lawyer. Lorna kneels down before him.  She unzips his pants. I got it. She pulls down his pants, looks up at him. I don't know if I should be doing this. She starts to stroke him. Now you sound like my priest. Priests? Who are the best tippers? And the worst? Politicians? Stop it.  I can't do it. I can't...I'm sorry. Lorna instinctively puts a little distance between herself and  Jerry. No, you don't understand.  I can't fucking go through with it! Jesus! Adrenaline pumping, he doesn't even notice the blood on his hand. She shakes her head --  she's completely nonplussed. Yeah... I don't know. She wants to have a baby.  That's the way it's supposed to be,  right? My parents approve of her.  Her parents approve of me.  Everybody  approves... That's my whole life.  My whole goddam carrot-and-stick-life.  or that person's approval.  Playing one role, then another.   Then another!  The good student.  The good son.  The industrious  boy.  Good grades.  High ambitions.  Pats on the back.  Handshakes  from people who matter!  The good boyfriend, getting on his knees  and proposing to the good girlfriend.  The dutiful bachelor,  receiving the traditional blow-job from a... I've lost count of all the roles, there's so many of them. (beat) I have no idea who I'm playing now. And you want to do that your entire life?  You can't...you... Well, I can't live somebody else's version of my life anymore. What? The suburbs at night.  Cozy, warm-lit. I'm going to do it. He smiles at Lorna.  Then, he climbs out the window. I'm sorry. Have we met? You must be thinking of somebody else. Lorna reacts.  Stops herself. Excuse me... And he disappears into the church. The wedding ring is a powerful symbol.  It is a circle, with  no beginning and no end.  It is also the circle that encloses  your love for each other-- Do you, Rosalie, take this man, to have and to hold, in sickness  and in health, till death do you part? And do you, Jerry, take this woman, to have and to hold, in sickness  and in health, till death do you part? I do. Then, by the power invested in me by Christ, Our Lord, I now  pronounce you husband and wife. Ladies, this event is strictly for invited guests. Ma'am...Let's not do this.  You're not with the groom. Terri points to Lorna. A Man finishing a cigarette.  He catches Lorna looking his way.  The Man gives Lorna a last look before pulling the curtains closed. She lingers at the curb for a moment, pondering her next move.
