I will, Chief. Absolutely. I guess so. Wow. Sure, right away, Chief. Yes, sir. The mother is in Florida visiting her sister. The father works at home, so he's probably inside. The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith. They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas. I think he's dead!Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry. It was stolen. The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills. The phone company shows no unusual -- It's me, Chief. Can you talk?I'll make the call. I understand. The best. What do you want to do? Yes, sir. But what about the disks? If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat. You wanted to let Sonny handle it. I would've moved in when we first found out. The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.Find out how we can hurt him. By the end of the day, I want to own him. Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family. Who's running the show up there? Put our people on the scene. Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids. Fuck them! Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this. Maybe Glen already picked up the disks. No way. I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there. What, he's cute? That's his idea of humor? I guess not, too. How much information is in the house? You think we should take that chance?I want a message sent: No fuckups allowed. Sonny's a fuckup. If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on. But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses. Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place? I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard. I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan. And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization. Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.Shut up! Shut up and get on the floor ! Bullshit! Mars, watch the cops! Kevin! Watch the back of the house! Get on the floor ! You're not goin' anywhere! Get on the fuckin' floor! Stay down! Stay down , goddamnit! Am I talkin' raghead?! I want your car! Gimme the goddamned keys ! Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine. I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car. She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair! Then we might as well die rich. Fuck it's over. That money's mine. Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid... The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it. He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights. He's probably planning it right now. If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash. That's how we'll stay alive. For chrissake, please ! Help me celebrate! I figured it out! We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich. I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives. Not if they're looking at something else. These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard. All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free. That's why we tied him, dumbass. Now come here and see this -- Jesus, first Mars, now you. You two need anti-depressants. Are you totally stupid? What does it look like? You're being stupid. Check out the bathroom. Maybe we can sneak out a window -- Bullshit. Why would Mars do that? We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do! Stop it! They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us! We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one. That's why we gotta keep going. I'm not gonna go in for murder. Shut up, goddamnit! Just calm down! I didn't know he would have a gun! It just went off! Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead. Not if they don't catch us, Kevin. Try to act cool, okay? He's gonna think you're a dick. Mars?! Whattaya think, dude? Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right? It ain't been a good day, Chief. There's a million dollars in there, maybe two million. I'll give you half. Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know. Maybe that's what I'm doing. Can I reach in my pocket, show you something? Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life? You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me? You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door! Fuck that! You bastards will jump me! Okay. We been through that. Forget it. You oughta try on the problem I got in here. That you, Talley? You're a funny guy, Talley. What? I'll give you these people. I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico. Talley? We'll burn this fuckin' place down! I got gasoline all over in here! I got these people! You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them! Fuck that. They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away. How about the cop? You don't have to explain shit! That Chinaman pulled a gun. We wrestled for it. That Chinaman shot himself. They're fine. Fuck you. I'm running this shit. You talk to me. We're cool. Yeah. I'm Rooney. You with the cops? Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before. That little fuck untied himself anyway. Aw, Jesus, not more of this. Use more ice. Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed. Shut up and sit down. You think someone's gonna make a house call? Who else is here? Jesus, get upstairs and find out! If he took those kids, we're fucked! Shit ! That fuck ! Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up! Did he take the kids with him? You mean he left , as in went out the front door? Fuckin' A. You got something to say? Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share. And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars. What the fuck is that? We don't have time! The cops are comin'! Find something, Kevin. Don't just stand there. And tie this bastard, too. I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us. That's right. That's a good idea, Mars. We can take it with us. Who gives a shit, Mars? Check out the cash! We're rich.Pretty sure I do. Yeah, here we go -- Keeps to himself, more like. That would be Mars Krupchek. Jesus, he works for me, too.If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too. You should let them know. I guess not. Maybe we're getting too dramatic. It's three kids. They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that. Why would they search the house?Are you out of your mind? Donuts here any good? We have to own this guy, Marion. We don't want him dead; we need to use him. He has a wife and kid. That's how we'll get to him. Talley lives here. I don't know if the place has security or not. What hospital? Goddamnit, tell me what you know . Did the cops go in? Did Smith have the disks? You worry about your end. I got my side covered. What do you mean? Give me an ETA. You'd better be kidding. If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter. Do you want to lose both of them? All right. Now the second one. Where is it? They're close. Let me make a call. You can see they're okay. Take it easy. Just take it easy. We're here to do business. You got ten minutes. If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find. Fuck the mall. You know that motel on the road west of town? Fuck that! You think I'm crazy?! What do you want? I have your fucking family. Don't forget that. How did you get this number?I'm not going to die for this! That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed! It's over. We have to give up. That's crazy. He's not going to kill us. What are you talking about? Celebrate what? Going to prison? There is no way out. We're fucked. We can't carry all this. It's too heavy. Like what? That's crazy, Dennis. The cops will see us. Someone should stay with Mr. Smith. What if he wakes up? Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide. Jesus. What is this? I was there , Dennis! I saw ! It's like he wanted to shoot that cop. That cop didn't pull his gun. Mars lied. He just started shooting! It's about Mars -- I have to tell you something -- We should give up. All we're doing is making it worse. We could've gone out the back! You didn't have to shoot! We're on foot. We can't get away. What if he's dead? What if you killed him? That woman's gonna call the cops. There's fuckin' blood all over you! We got jobs, man; we're working. Why even take the chance? Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison. C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid. I thought we were gonna go to the movies. Dennis and Mars are in the den. I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand? All three of us will go, but we have to move fast. Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this. Do you want to go or not? I'm offering you a way out of here. Keep your voice down. I'm taking you and your brother out of here. He's just knocked out. I've been knocked out. Whatever. Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you. Which do you want? You gotta pee? Mars? What are you doing?That's enough. Chief Talley is the one who got you out. He. Can't. Answer. I'm not going to wake him. I don't even know that I can. What are you doing?! Stop that! Ain't gonna happen. We've got unequal pupilation. He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.I don't know. I overheard him with the girl. I like it here, Dennis. I'm never going to leave. Dennis. They'll cut the power. I got the gasoline -- Find something: Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight. You can't run with suitcases. We're trapped in a house. It's a safety room. If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide. Now we can do whatever we want. Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone. Kevin left without you. Make the pizza. I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine. We're hungry. You're going to cook. We can't make the microwave work. Mommy won't know. You can do anything you want right now. Mommy won't know. Want one?Goddamned small town bullshit. -- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance! What is going on ? I'm not stupid! You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out -- I want to know what in hell you're doing. Excuse me? You requested our help. You turned over command -- You've been here all day, Chief. Take a break. See your family. If I need you, I'll call. Then I think we should wait. Do you agree? Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger? If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in. Looks like you're bailing out at the right time. Jesus. He must've siphoned it from the cars. Order your men to stand down. Maddox! You got that? Sounds like you know the job. Do it. Laura Martin. This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --Yes, sir. Chief, it's Mikkelson. The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two. He has an Agua Dulce address. Chief, Mikkelson. It's right in front of us. We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.Where's the office? They've been in there all day. Not until the man calls. You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call. When he gives the word, we move. Think of me that way and you won't fuck up. I'll handle the Sheriffs. I asked you my name. You just saw my commission slip. What's my fucking name? What's my name? Don't worry about what we used to be. In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring. So let's get our shit straight before that happens. Don't be funny, Chief. You can't afford it. Okay, here's mine. My name is Special Agent Jones.Canyon Country. I don't know . Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out. He's fucking us over, Glen. That guy is fucking us over. I heard he's fucked up. They're taking him to the hospital. If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end. What if it goes south? An hour, tops. Might be sooner. L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.Get to work. Fuck guessing. You keep your mouth shut. Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs. You understand me, Larry? Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant. When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house. That would be the girl who opened the door. Are the others inside? Don't shout, Larry. I'm three feet away. Mike! Mike, can you hear me? Keep trying. You get anything on Smith? Dead end--it's a clone. What about the Mustang? What'd you find out? Talley. Give up, Dennis. Let these people go. At least you'll have your life. Give up. You picked a bad house to hole up in, son. I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could. You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for? Only if you try to grab me. We could've shot you from the wall. You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again. If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court. If you won't let me come in, then put him outside. Let me come get him. Now I understand. That helps. I can make them understand that. We can't forget it. The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead. They think you murdered him. I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith. The one and only. We got a little problem out here, Dennis. I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox. You talk to him for a while. I gotta piss real bad. Hey, Dennis? Can I let you in on a personal secret? The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed. There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us. I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go? That's not going to happen, Dennis. They won't give you a helicopter. I'm here. It's over now, Dennis! Don't hurt anyone. We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you. Dennis? I want you to release those people. Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis. He died. All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house. Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation -- How about your two friends? You don't have a man dying in there, do you? Let me speak to Mr. Smith. I want to hear it from him. We had an awful lot of shooting. You need a doctor in there? The Bristo Police Department. Look out the window. You see the car? You have his address? Is Krupchek an aggressive guy? Hot- tempered? Anything like that? Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC. Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier. Can you identify this man? I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the real FBI. This one's a fake. I'll kill you! You won't get the other disk! First my girls. I get my girls, you get the other disk. Close. You get the other one when I have my girls. Not talk to them; have them. You said they would be here! You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they? Yeah. I think you got no choice. My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family. We'll trade. I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza. Ask if I can keep it. Mr. Jones is dead. So are two of his men. The other three are in jail. I have the disks. I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker? I have you. I'm scared shitless. I don't know how long I'll be stuck here. Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place? I'll meet you there as soon as I can. The Sheriffs will take over when they get here. I should've called. This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast -- Can we talk some more when you get here? I still see that boy's eyes. I need to work out some stuff. Get in the car. Now . Keep your head down. We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses. Holster your guns! Are civilians inside? Another minute. Please -- I need to talk to him. Alone. I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police. So far as we know, your children are okay. Just one question. Please. Smith! Wake up! I'm the chief of police here. I have to talk to him. It's a crank, Louise. C'mon, don't waste my time with that! Is something wrong with Jane? Get everyone out here. Then call the Sheriffs. Tell them we have a possible hostage situation. That's not enough. Where are they? What are you talking about, shot? What happened? Stand by. What's wrong with the radio? Did you find Jane and Mandy? They might be at the house. Keep trying and let me know. I'm going to be here a little while longer. You have her cell number? Go. Tell her I'm almost home. Call Jane for me. She's at the little Thai place. Louise? Get a phone number for the Smiths. Louise? Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that. Put a unit out there. Then we don't know if she's part of this or not. Mickey, you up? Did he say if she was shooting at him? One at a time! Clear the air! Louise? Talk to me. What do we have? Let it go, Captain. Don't question me, Captain! This is my crime scene! I'm looking for you. I need your tactical unit. And now I'm taking it back. We're getting Smith out of the house. You want me to stick around, I could -- No. He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying. They have security cameras. Rooney would see you coming. He says that his father's hurt. That's why you get the big bucks, Captain. If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs. The whole place would go up. He says he has gasoline set to burn the place. Then get your men off the wall! You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath! I know this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him. I've done it once or twice. I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him. Don't crowd the house. The alpha's a kid named Rooney. He's amped up and volatile. I'm Talley. Who's in charge? Mickey? Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait. Go, Mickey. It's mine. Talley. Contact the landlord. I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy. Go, Mickey. Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name. Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders. You see it? Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later! The kids are in here! Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath! He kills people! We've got to get those kids out of there! What does he have on you? I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you? What are you people going to do? Special Agent Jones. What? How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here. You used to be a cop. All of you used to be cops. I can tell by the way you move. Are all of you named Jones? Are the disks still in your room? Who is it? Try Al. See if you can open Al. Look for names. Does it say whose taxes they are? Can you open them? If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught? Can you get into the office? I thought they locked you in your room. I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office. Could you find them and see who they belong to? Your dad has two computer disks. They have funny names: Marlon and Al. I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt. I need your help with something. But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay? The doctors are taking care of him right now. Thomas . . . are you safe? Can you talk? I've got the boy on the phone. He's using a cell phone. What was that, son? I didn't hear you. That's on the second floor. Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you? Where are you right now? How about you and your sister? Slow down, Thomas. Take it easy and talk to me. Was your father shot? This is Chief Talley. Tell me your name, son. How do I reach him? A man has my family. Gold watch here. Dark tan. Yes. He's going to kill you. Don't you know that? He can't take the chance that you'll talk. They're still in the house. These disks . . . where are they? You want . . . Marlon and Al. I can't control what happens. The Sheriffs are running the scene. Marlon and Al.... You can let go. What do you want? Who are you? I'm the Chief. I don't carry it. What do you mean by that? Your phony FBI assholes. I guess we do. I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the real FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!! And I've got Smith ! I've got Smith !! Do you think I'm going to let you murder someone?!Smith will know. I have people in York Estates right under your nose. If you do anything except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail. We clear on that? When this phone rings, you answer. It will be me. I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family. You will re-assume command. In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates. You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team. We want them. You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks. Can we let go? You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid? These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out. It's for your own good. Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand? Follow the Mustang. We won't go far. Where's your gun?You don't want another dead child on your conscience. We're almost home, you and me. Keep your shit together. This isn't L.A. My people are good to go. You know who I mean? I guess we each have something the other wants. You want a blowtorch on your daughter's pretty face ?! You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up bad !I know. Shh, they'll hear you! I'm not gonna leave you! We can't carry him. We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs. Then we can run for it. That big asshole nailed my windows. Be quiet! Listen! No! They're right here -- Charles G. Benza. They're coming! Yeah! Here's a name. This is somebody's personal tax -- I don't see any people names. It's all businesses. I opened Marlon. I think it's somebody's taxes. Yes, sir. I can get into the den. The office is right across the hall. I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house. But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around. Then I could open the disks here in my room. Dennis won't let me go to the desk. He makes me sit on the floor. He has lots of disks. What do you want me to do? Okay. I think so. Is my daddy okay? If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras. They would see you outside, too -- They nailed the windows. I can't get'm open. In my room. We're okay. Dennis hit him. His head's all big and he won't wake up. I'm really scared. Thomas Smith. I'm in the house that's on TV. Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up. You gotta help him.It's happening right now. He knows better than that. You should warn them, Sonny. I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house. Worst case, it's a bloodbath. The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get. But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this -- You won't die if you let me help. I have contacts in Los Angeles. Lawyers and judges who can help you. I'm going to my desk. The car. All you want is the car? Who sent you? Jen? Are you all right? That would be Glen Howell. He was on his way for the disks. Then you have everything. You can put them away. Did you find the disks? I don't know what you're talking about. Where are my children?
