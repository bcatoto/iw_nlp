They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father. Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display. I think you do. But I thank God we all don't. Did they take your clothes? Going nearer to God! No violence, please. That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"... I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas. That was lucky. Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help. Does that surprise you? I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter. I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you. You'd be Gandhi -- ...I thought you'd be bigger.What'd he say? Well, he must've found some of the answers... What was he like? You mean Gandhi? How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life." "Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people." Eleven. There's no room! And the air is lovely. All the more reason. In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us! Everyone takes his turn. Oww! Yes -- I can't talk like this. Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack." Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them. "A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law. Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man. Enough. I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought. I expect you to show as much patience as I am now. No. That is what you get for distracting me. Not without defeats -- and great pain. But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain? What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so. Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu. That I find hard to bear -- even in prison. No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has -- It does. We must be getting old, Charlie. I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine. If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them. Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison. What are you doing? Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall. Well, we shall try. I thought you were a man of God. Not anymore. At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or -- You're a clergyman. Some of it good, I hope. I'm sorry. No, no -- just a moment, please. A -- a week. No -- neither do I. But... but this man is a Christian and he has written -- Tell me -- do you think about hell? That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again. They are only clinging to old dreams and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when and how. Wait and see... wait and see... And Jinnah? Panditji -- please, help me. Tell that to the families of the policemen who died. If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it. We must end the campaign. I've never spoken for anything else. Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small... Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live. We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere. Are you going to walk all the way? Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand. It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns. You've done me a great service. I've traveled so far -- and thought so much. As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians. The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped. Do you remember much of South Africa? Perhaps. I've come here to think about it. And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen? Even as a boy I thought so. I hope not. That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world. There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men. I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response." Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community. You belong to a very important profession. It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man. I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles. Do you find me stubborn? First spin. Let the others march for a time. Good. Ba will have to teach you to spin too. Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master. An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind. We must stop. I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop. The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked. I -- There is nothing I can give. They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger. Not true! The secret is mastering the urge. I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru. No. I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel. Who is that young man? If we hold firm, it won't be the last. It's split the Government. My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others. So did I. They're sparing no one, I see. I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England. And I will use the courts. Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else. You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him? In England, I was a poor student but I -- I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money. Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi. I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment. I congratulate them. Very well. Somehow I expected not. Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done. I dined at the prison. Thank you. No.Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail. He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he? Who's leading them? And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus! After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye. You mean a general strike? I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss. We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think -- Well, that's one victory. The fools! Sorry... I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women? No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press. Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon? I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker. That was England.What do you want? I say when is now -- and we will determine how. He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think. I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid! It was one incident. What can we do? The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence. I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know. I thought you were against fighting. Bapu -- please. Where are you going. In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan. He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better. Bapu, for me, and the rest, if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away. Have you read his magazine? He's "discovering" India.We need your help! That's when you take advantage. It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day. Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious... Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore. I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero. That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something. Could we cut all news off? I know -- ...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind. Have you found him? If you did this, no one could control it. No one. No -- but I think I'm going to. Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?I'll take your luggage back, baas. Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for -- Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa? "Hell!"Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works. I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother. ...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest. And it still goes on. Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.Oh! Neither have I. I'm awfully sorry. All right. Fine. Assuming we are in agreement? You're an extraordinary man. Good. Good. I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation. I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed. I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that? Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple. Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to. Ahh. Perhaps some tea? Will you have a glass of sherry?He said he's in charge... Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out. Back in South Africa... long time ago. Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time. ...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did. My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is. Is it over if they arrest you now? It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing. A great deal. Hm. Is it? It's beautiful. You're an ambitious man. Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right? You will respect the law. Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
