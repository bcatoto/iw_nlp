All right!! Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys. Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill. Brad, can I talk to you a minute?I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor. You want to work at Carl's? Arnold. What's happening? I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year. Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor. Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again. Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years! What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and... Don't worry about it. Of course. Later. First door on your left! It's the first door on your left! It's the first door on your left. Go ahead. Just make it quick. Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign? You really want me to put all this stuff back on? I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable. This is how I dress all the time. Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass. I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here. I can't do that. But if you wait a minute... Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too... Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here. All right, then. It's your secret. You're not going to tell me, are you? Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway? See you later. Does Mom know you have company? Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin! Are you still a virgin? I didn't say that. Maybe yes. Maybe no. Why? Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend. Well... it's true. Where did you hear that? I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom. Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent. I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own. Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers? I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson? They're not home yet. I take out the garbage. Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up. Mom says to clean up the pool. Hey-yo. Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is? What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over. So who do you have first period? Sis. Yes, sir. He insulted me first. He called me a moron. Okay, Dennis. But they weren't mine. They were left over from the last shift. No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.Manager!! I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to... Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay? Please, Brad? See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back. No. I want my money back right now.Jeff you have company! Dad says! Dad says you're late again, you butthole! Dad says you have to get up!All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break. Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay. Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it? Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once. There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion. All right, I take it back. How do you know it's mine? We only did it once. Why don't you call me up tonight? What? Now? What's going on? Hello. Look, I'm kind of in a hurry. Oh. Hi. I think I came. Didn't you feel it? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. What? Are you all right? Let's continue. You first. No. Are you crazy? You're a really good kisser. Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend. Come on... I don't know. It's getting pretty late... Well... I know what I look like. I don't know. Do you have any ice tea? You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him? What a guy. Get a ride with somebody. Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi. Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework! Nice to meet you, Stacy. Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too. What do you read? What's the last book you read? So what makes you so sensitive? Sensitive -- what is that? Whatever you say, Rat. You're crazy. Those girls love me. Fine. Get lost. Jesus. I'm sorry. She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway. If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying? No. I don't think so. Not right now. Poor guy. Well, I've gotta be running. I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back? Hey, Mark. Is that you? I'm really pretty busy... Did you go home and get it? Mark. What happened to your date? Yo. You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts... And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss. All right. Pay attention. What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free. Ace the jacket. Hey, Rat. There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall. The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith. That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude. Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens. Okay. Okay. Here's what you do. I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her. I would. Yeah. It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes. Did you get her name? Did you get her number? All right... where did you see her? It's definitely your mama. You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy. You should work for yourself.You're fired. Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way? Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way? Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball. Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton. Perfectly good. Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton? Any problems?What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all? Are you going to ride that wave? Who's that? Fascinating. I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us? How often do you go? I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could... I was going to say... your eyes look a little red. How've you been?Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton. Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that! But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform. Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?Aloha, Spicoli. Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by. If you graduate. Well, you'll find out next year. What's that? I think I've made my point with you tonight. Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you. Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty. Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here. As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson. Do you want to sit there, Jeff? I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff. Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff? That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in? And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week. Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time. Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing? Food will be eaten on your time! Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this? You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't? Thank you, Desmond. What's the reason for your truancy? Yes. Mr. Spicoli? Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here. Really? What class?Is this your first time? No. I mean back to your home. I think I better take you home. Are you really nineteen? It's very warm out tonight. Thanks. Thanks a lot. All right, the point it is. How about the point? Where do you feel like going? 'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.' You look nice tonight. No problem. How about your phone number? You look like you could still be in high school.Easy, mon. There it is! On the ledge? I can't find it, mon! Totally. Something happened to them, mon. Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Ugh. Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards. Totally. That's me, Merv. Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning. Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it? I don't go at all. School. School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time. Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains. I've been swimming, Merv. Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great. Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but... Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car. Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us? Just be glad you're all right. You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel. All right. Die, Granada Jocks! It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada! What the fuck is this guy doing? All right. Naw. Any good? Then don't hassle it. I thought he was out of town. Aloha, Mr. Hand! All right! Oh, yeah! You're gonna flunk me?! No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building. Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff? Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question? Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand. I don't know. I guess so. Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand? Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year. Mr... Mr. Hand. You better save some for me, you swine! I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time? Learning about Cuba. Having some food. I don't know. I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever. I couldn't make it in time. Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here! Hey, bud. What's your problem? You just ripped my card in two! That's the name they gave me. Can I come in? This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window. Yeah. I'm registered for this class.It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond. Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough. Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people. Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking. And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive. The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl. You're losing it, Damone. I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out. Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove? No Damone. I don't understand. Chicken! Really. Okay. See ya. Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone. Damone! You come here? Damone, are you there? No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here? It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home. Damone. It's Mark. I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her. Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan? Knock it off, Damone. I need real help. Yeah? I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now. The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude. Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen. You tell me, Mike. What do I do? Really? Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?' No. It's too soon. No. She's in my biology class. Damone, you gotta listen to me. What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her. Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week. Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around... But I'll give you a call sometime. Really? Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual. Hi, Stacy. How are you? I'll get you the notes. Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in. John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday. It's John Bonham's birthday. Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th. Well... it's getting kind of late. ...I've got to go home. Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan. Sure. I don't know. So... pretty nice house you've got here. Naw. I don't mind. No. That's okay. Where's your brother? Okay. Sure. I'll come in. Aren't your parents asleep? I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez. I had a really nice time tonight. Two more Cokes. Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment? Oh yeah. Excellent. Do you know what you want? Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant. Yeah. She is pretty good. Yeah. It's my sister's. Sure thing. Oh... yes. My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime? You keep them. What do you do with the jackets people leave here? I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy? Two Cokes. Well... sure. She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
