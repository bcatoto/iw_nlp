"He" wanted me to warn you. Look at this, all of you! I found this today. There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this... Drop me off? How do you mean? Going? How do you mean? My name is Abel. And I am my brother's keeper.You're all just jealous. I did?! I broke the world's record. ... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this? Who brought up this bright idea? Yes, you can. Come on, Shelly! Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time. But you gotta stop doing these things. Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I? So don't embarrass me. When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself. Same thing. Dammit Shelly! Why do you always have to be such an asshole! Do you want a beer or not? I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one? Hey Deb... can you hear me? You're too clean for me. What're you doin'? I vote for me. I'll think of something. I know how to do it. I mean, how do we do it in the hammock? How do we do it? If you insist. How about a roll in the hay? We haven't looked in the barn, yet. Let's take a look. Sounds disgusting. Let's go. I don't know... Where's Shelly? Breakfast? I didn't mean it the way it sounded... So what would a weekend in the country be without sex? What're you gonna do?Will you come with me? Don't do that to me! What's the matter?! I can't even remember what day it is, man. Maybe we should do some exercise. And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either. It's dark down there. I love you, man! I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man. Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight... I don't think I can make it, man! Destroy the evidence? No, man!You know him? Sure, just watch where you're going. It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you. After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year. No one would tell me anything. All I know is what the police told me. We have nowhere to go unless you let me in. What happened? What happened that night? I don't know. I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us. How do I break through? And, what about us? Why did you come back here? What do you mean? You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else. The nights are always so peaceful and quiet. This is too painful to look at. Let's spread out and check all the rooms. Outside, too. You stay with me. Shelly! Where are you?! Goldilocks and the Three Bears? No. I got here just before you did. Look what I found. Remember these? What? Okay. There's a whole weekend ahead of us. There's time. You're irresistible. I lose control. Is that so bad? Hello. How are you? I'm sorry. I just wanted to surprise you. What can I say? Why?That's an eyeball! Oh, God! What is that? I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off? Where are you going? Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is. I was just kidding. According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago. We were looking for something to keep our hands busy. It was either this or an orgy. Vera chose this. What're ya gonna do? No more... I can't! Would you be yourself... ...if you looked this this? I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor. You don't to say it. I can tell. Being a jerk is better than being nothing. I just want you to like me. I have to. You've just learned a valuable lesson. A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone. Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today. I like you... very much. I was thinking that maybe. A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new. It was nothing. Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right? Stop the car! Now!! No time to explain. Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can. Okay? Just keep your eyes on the road. Maybe. I don't see anything. Just a dirty window. Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that. Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon. Gulp! Are they following us? Please... be cool. Excuse me, but I believe that's mine... Is... is everything all right? Not us! He's really creepy. That scarecrow? Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him. Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry. Faster! Eat faster! What are we gonna do? Stick around and you'll see. My whole world. I'm sorry. Hi.
