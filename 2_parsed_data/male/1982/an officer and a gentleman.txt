I knew you'd make it! Where's your girl? Didn't she come? Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before! I never said any of that! I wrote. Not every week... There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked. Who? Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please. Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk -- Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya? Great ass. Who's that? Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad. Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back? Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that? Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed. Who gave you this idea? Why? You... in the Navy? Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled. So what're you doing in Seattle? Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla. Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come. I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil. Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful? You should've called! Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit! Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron. Okay, okay. You win. Come back here, kid! You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change. I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia. This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base. Well, that's how long I've been out at sea. Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea... How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it? I'm Byron. Nice to meet you. C'mon. Let's go get your luggage. You, Zack?Go on, Zack! Go for the record! Zack, we've got to go. The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right? Ever heard of knocking, mayo? Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat. You're pretty funny, Mayo.See you in the fleet, sir! I know. Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir! You're good. What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here. Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up! I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait. Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry. Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out! It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again. Maybe there's hope for you yet. Mayo, are those your friends? Not a fucking chance, asshole! Pity you don't have the character. What is it, the kicks? Is that it? Why? Because you can do it alone? That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines? Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo! No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans. Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me. No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do. Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser. Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo? That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you? She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree? Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit. I want your D.O.R. I thought I recognized the work. Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise. Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work. How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo? What's your name, boy? Are you laughing at me, dick-brain? What did you call me, Mayo? Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits! Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on! Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer. Where are you from, boy? Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer? Lauder, Sweet Pea! No, sir! You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy? Before that. What did you call me, boy? What did you call me? Hi, son. I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand? Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?! I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet. Louder! Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Yes, sir!! Yes, sir!I don't mean anything by it. When did this happen? Esther, do you think she's using... ...birth control? Come over here where I can see you. Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant! Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage? Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys. But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy -- What are you tired from? I said, come here!Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana. He said he grew up poor? Yeah. All week long. I see you didn't DOR, Mayo. You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend. I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack. Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation? Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel. How do you figure that's your bunk?Zack, don't! Whatever you say, Mayonnaise. No, sir. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. No, sir. No, sir! No, sir. No. I didn't call you anything before that. I called you Sarge. Pardon? How're you doing, Sarge? Well, I'll be goddamned. What? Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it. I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now. We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed. That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it! No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck. Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise... Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you. ...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side. So how late are you, Lynette? My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing. No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that. Exactly how late are you, Lynette? How late? By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now? Lynette, I told you already, it won't work. Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay? Or we could do that yeah. What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...? You're sure it's okay? Something tells me you've been here before. I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about something else? Yeah. He was. He died. Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can. Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived. Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own. I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me. Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks! He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter. I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared... No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived. It's mine. But it would still be my kid. That's the point. I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I? She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere. It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it. No, but she's gotta be at least a month late. But it can't wait. Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week. Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel. Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist? She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her. My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died. I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette. Thanks for covering for me. I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us. What? You've gotta be kidding! I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it? A little. What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you? Yeah. Sure. Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich. Nice, hospitable folks they get around here. I hope she comes. Shhhh... Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet. Could you believe those girls! It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart. Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration? I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me? Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on? That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.Naw. That's over with. What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch? I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it! She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her... That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away. What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important. That what she was... a Norfolk Deb? Yeah, I know. Yeah, I sort of thought so myself. Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends. From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present. I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you. You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief? Nobody. It just came to me. To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away. That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier. I joined the Navy. Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away. Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I. Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown. You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree. Neither have you, pard! Hi, Byron. Thank you, sir! What for? I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place. I ain't never going back to that school, sir. Great. I been calling for four months. Yes, sir. Yes, Sir. Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you. Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here! No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit! Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push. Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself! You got it, Sweet Pea. Nice boonies, Seeger. Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night. Survival of the fittest. Good morning, girls. Great. You can go in my place. Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down. Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am... Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you. Well, goodbye. I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant. Get on your feet and find out how good, sir. Yes, sir! Aw screw it... It's important, sir! Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private. I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you? But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir. You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through? Yes, sir! That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir! I don't want to do something anybody can do. No, sir! I want to fly jets, sir! I want to fly, sir! Sir, that's not true! I love my country! Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir! I'm doing okay, sir. No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this. No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting. Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines. Not exactly, sir. Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir! No, sir! You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you?? And you turned him down?? What did you tell him about the baby? Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please. That's brilliant. I bet you do! Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him. Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that! Why? I don't know where that is. Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay? Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him. I'm looking for Sid. I know that. I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises. Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you? No wonder he was looking at me like that. Your real father was an Officer candidate like me? Your real father? Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him? What would you do differently? No. Is that what you want? Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas. No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you. No, they're for your mom. Hi. Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know? Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family... Hey, will you just leave me alone? Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula. I'm sorry. I can't sit with you. Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down. The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that. My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school. That's no excuse for not going after what you want. What's stopping you? I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually. I'll get it if you want. That was great. I forgot to thank you for breakfast. I've never had a girl. You're better than candy. That's it? What do you want, Paula? What do you really want? Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your -- I'm starving. You stayed after all. Be a friend. Leave. Forget it. Just get out of here. You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed. I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind. There's always a choice. I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked. My kinda group! Me, too. I think we're making some of the locals jealous. You're a very pretty girl, Paula. Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies. Do you go to school? Yeah? Why're you here? I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband. No, and I'm not looking for one either. Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi. My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet. Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack. Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop. Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki? The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it. How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me. Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...? Hey, Sid, thanks. Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation. I can't risk it. I don't notice anyone else complaining. Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five. He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I? I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little? Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out? Sid, what happened? Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility? Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility? Do you know that for sure? Not if she won't even talk about an abortion. So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time. But she expects you to marry her? Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself. Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor? Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit. You should've done what I did. A clean break. I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her. I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan? No problem, but who's Susan? That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from. Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week. Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can. You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away. That isn't true, is it? Naw. Hey, you guys still awake? You okay? She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts. Look at Foley! Can you believe it! 'Nellie's Nymphos!' You told us it would grow out an inch. Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this? Jets. Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end. I've seen better.
