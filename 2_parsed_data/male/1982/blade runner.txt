That wouldn't be very sporting. One man. He must be good. You underestimate the trap, Mary. What's the point? Where? Pris? I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian. What do you think, Mary? Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated. We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate. He knows what he's doing. Well stocked. We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost. Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along... Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for. I've done some questionable things. I am? But not to last. Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells. What about E.M.S. recombination? Why? I want more life, fucker. Death. Had in mind something a little more radical. Can the maker repair what he makes? It's not an easy thing to meet your maker. Yeah. It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian. Why don't you go home. The name is Batty. Roy Batty. No, you stay here with us. Out last night together. Where are you going, Sebastian? You're our best and only friend. When do you deliver your project? Be better if I could talk to him in person. But he's not an easy man to get to. His company made us. Tyrell could help us, Sebastian. What about your friend, the man who owns this building? If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. You could help us. Not only that, but we have smiliar problems. Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet. We have a lot in common. Like what? Nexus - 6. What, Sebastian? Why are you staring at us? Well, actually If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be... I like a man who stays put. An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you? Okay, but don't kill him. Save a little for everybody. A masterpiece. Very good, Pris. Now show him why. Not if everybody is doing their job here at home. How are things at home? Hello, glad to meet you. When? What's going on down there?Go. If you don't, we will. It has to be total, Deckard. That's an order from as high as it comes. Got it? Okay, here it is. Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred. The cat is about to get out of the bag. Pressure is definitely on. The Nexus program is terminated. When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire. Take a number. Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South. She's not with you? This is Bryant. Are you alone? Look, go home. Get some rest. Take an aspirin. You didn't like her!? Then let her get away. I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker! If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold. I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes. Good luck. Bryant here. Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section. You better get on it. Industrial refuse. The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model. Check it out on the Voight-Kampff. There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect. If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek. We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm. Its guess is that all five are in the city. There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure. But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing. Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees. Guess he found himself one. Five. Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation. Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.Yeah. I got it. Got it. Who. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't like her. She was gonna get away. I was just about to have my dinner. Yeah. Garbage man? What was the cover on the one that got Holden? Where do we start? You got a machine on it yet? What was he after? Six, huh? Number three. Next. Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females. Never mind. Do they have that knowledge? The umbrella. Not if it works. Yes? I think we're through for the night. I know all that. Okay, but... How do I stop one? You start. You equipped for random questions? Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass. Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill. I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me. Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image. If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot. Four years. I don't know. I gotta piss. I like you too. No thanks. Prosit. How long you had these guys? Those cockroaches? Sorry, don't have the time. Prosit. My pleasure. Shot of vodka, please. I'll but you one. What'll you have? It's okay. Forget it. These aren't just... What's that? I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes. No. I got a problem. Yeah. But that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I'm doing okay. Sorry. Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled. Me too. But if you could? Why didn't you go? Never been more sure of anything in my life. They'll change the limit before I change my mind. Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there. Nope. True. Huh huh. Yeah? Meaning? No rust? What shows? Book the good ones for where? You talking about the Opera House on the Main? What's suck night? What night? The girl that doesn't look like that girl. What did she want? Do you recognize any of them? I'd like you to take a look at these pictures. Can I come in? Taffey Lewis? Me. Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress. You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body. Sorry. Does it eat? It's a good job. It that mother real? For holes. Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here. I'd like to check the dressing room if I could. Like to get this position. Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person? You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way? There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place. I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists... What? Just wait here. Don't leave here. Don't open the door, don't answer the phone. No, I don't. Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it. Because it's not. Nope. Nobody could stand me that long. What's a long time? You mean a woman? I never felt better. Good for a smart girl to feel stupid. Part of your education. I don't like the noise. Just practice. Practice makes perfect. Never mind the plug, just go through the motions. I don't like people snooping around my stuff. Don't be fooled by appearances. Hmmm? Like? What? It wasn't very good last night, was it? Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes. If they are smart, they take naps. Not too good. I am. Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out. Dead. Me and my dad. You did? You ever take a bath with a man before? Sit. Don't just stand there looking at me. It's not polite. Right. I can imagine. Yeah. So? I work alone. Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no. I've already got more help than I need. Is there anything else? Last question. You're watching an old movie. It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters. Sounds like you speaks from experience. In your opinion. Why not? You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion. You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug. In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl. You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist. You have a little boy. He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar. Why should I be? It's artificial? A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard. If it's a benefit, it's not our problem. I'll see you in a minute. Bad? What's up? You know where I been. I been on vacation. Discreetly. Five, maybe six. She didn't know? Thirteen. If she is, the machine works. One that relies on human interpretation. Where's the subject? Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof. No. Go ahead. Yes. Please. Thanks.I'm tired of this. How do you know I'm not? Sorry.Severed spine. You'd better get in here. Bryant's waiting for you. Holden got hit. Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is. Where the hell you been?I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way. Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it. I'm taking a piss. Let's hear it. Money? From what I hear you're doing great. Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army. Making a lot of money, huh? Hey, it's okay. I like to pee. So how are you doing? Don't make me laugh. It makes me pee. I'm great. I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great. How you like my new suit? I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon? You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon. Same thing. Know what a turtle is? Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows. So you look down and see a tortoise. It's crawling towards you... Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical. What? You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a... Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention. Answer quickly as you can. Don't move.My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live? How old am I? One more, eh? I like you. You like to kiss her goodbye. Prosit. Two months. But this one is not guy. It is girl. His girl. Ya. No problem. You want to see my friends? Prosit. Thank you very much. Vodka! But I would like to buy you drink. I think I have no money. Whatcha mean, I'm not helping? But I understand what you mean. I never seen a turtle. Of course. A tortoise. What's that? But how come I'd be there? What desert? What one? Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a... Sorry. I kinda get nervous when I take tests.Just thought I'd... Thank you. This afternoon. No. I'd be happy to mention it to him. He could? He's not really my friend. I just do a job for him now and then. Dr. Tyrell? I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy. I wish I did, but you're out of my league. Of course not. You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there? Like... Show me something? What generation are you? You're androids. You're just all so... so different. Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to. How about breakfast, I was just going to make some. Well, no, not really. There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor. Day after tomorrow. Soon as I finish the job. It's gotta be right for my customer. You're all so perfect. I keep a lot of provisions right here. Good. Ah, you get hold of your friends? Yes. I couldn't pass the test. My glands. They grow old too fast. Methuselah Syndrome. Twenty. Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now... Beautiful. You look... better. You scared me. I've got stuff. If you wanna go to my place? We sure did. What about friends? Where are your folks? Oh. You want to go home? Mine's J.F. Sebastian. What's your name? How come you were in my truck?Also extraordinary things. Also you're too valuable to experiment with. Put it this way. Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last. Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you. We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table. Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship. The ship sinks. The facts of life. I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal. A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established. Come here. I'm afraid that's a little out of my... What's the problem? Would you like to be modified? And what can he do for you? I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner. Here's your check, my boy. Thank you. Oh? All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced. And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground? How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard? Memory implant. She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning. I think she was beginning to suspect. How many questions did it take? The machine works. She is. Well? Sitting next to you. Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard. The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it? But in your profession that is a risk. Have you ever retired a human by mistake? May I ask a personal question? Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris? Is this to be an empathy test? Black?Almost through. You're not responding to the stimulus. I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading. We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard. Concentrate. Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.My job is here. Too old. You sure? What if you change your mind? You're going to be over the limit. But you haven't put in for emigration. Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy. Your mind kept wandering. That bothered me. During the road test... Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to. I didn't say that. Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time. Nerves of steel.
