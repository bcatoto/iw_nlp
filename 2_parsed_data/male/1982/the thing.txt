Nothing. Nothing at all. How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean? You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night? Well, where was he? Where did he go? What was he doing in the rec room? That night? Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog? Just anything at all? Any little thing? It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell. You can't let anybody leave! Don't you understand?! That Thing didn't want to become a dog... Listen to me, Garry. Please... No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease... ... It could have gotten to somebody... Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet. Look, I know it's hard to believe... Maybe. I've asked him to try and locate the site. Okay with you? Was that dog, the Norwegian dog? And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it. I know what you're up to. Don't think I don't. And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope. I'll hang myself before it gets to me. Nobody's getting in here. You can tell them all that! ... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form. Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form... ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly... ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or... Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise... I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here. Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog. Watch Clark. I don't know who to trust. No, you're not! I don't trust any of you! ... Can't you see...? If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it! Nothing! ... You think this Thing wants to become an animal? Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea. No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?! It wanted to become us!No. Just let him freeze out there. Why you so damn anxious to let him in here... Hell no. If it did get to him. Wasn't enough time. Generator was out, what...? Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody. Now hold on, you dumb... What's it going to do, being a plant? Let go of me... Now who'd go and do... Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart. Don't walk behind me. Ain't it there? Cool it, Palmer!! You lying bastard... I said where? Where'd you go?! That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing? Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana? Cut him loose? Clark, you want me to come in after you?! Clark, you come on out here!! That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you! Cut that out, Copper. Nauls? What's taking you?! No. The generator. You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it. Where's the damn flashlight? You fellas okay over there? Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker? I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them. If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours. Then we'll never make it. Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help. The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though. What do you mean "you think so?" Spaceship of some kind. Load of bullshit. We should have jumped his ass. Then kill me. You ain't tying me up. What for? We ain't buying that. You been made, MacReady. We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn. You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are! ... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline... Well, who says I want you going with me?! Gee, thanks! Garry's missing! MacReady! What do we do about those three? But... What we going to do?! Where's the other half? I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it. You buy any of this, Blair? Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh? I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit. You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair? Well, go on. MacReady! The dogs? What's happening?What the hell you looking at me like that for? Ah... He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half... Don't know. Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him. Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest. Left the room for a bit. When I came back, he was gone. Yeah. No. Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage. Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good... What do you mean "got" to the dog?Thank you. Damn you, MacReady! Enough, MacReady! Now hold him. I think so. I guess I'm the only one. Could be important work. Might as well bring it back. All in Norwegian. They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe -- My God, what in hell happened here? Screw regulations! Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there! A couple of hours. And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody. Goes on like that quite awhile. What do you gentlemen make of it? Bennings? Yes, there is. I'd like to go up. ... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us. After all this mess then. I'm getting worried about you. You ought to have a checkup. A day or so ago... I guess. I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away. A serum test possibly.Right. Why not? Started with six. There'd be four others left. 'Bout eighty kilos southwest. Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century. Now fuck off! Damn you, Blair! You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here. If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo... Anybody sick? So what's our problem? Sure. You think there's a connection? Couldn't make much of it myself. I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog. Was dark... find a light... Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator. I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. But... You catch anything he was saying? Well, get to it. How long will it take you to prepare this? Hold on, damn it. We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody. Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand... In this weather? Nothing we can do about that. What's that? How many in their party? That far? How far's that? I'll put this right through your head. Put that down! Well, stick with it. I want you at it round the clock. We got to get help in here... Well, stick to it. You reach anybody yet? How long's it been? One thousand volts. Should be enough. Pure nonsense. This won't prove a damn thing. Let's rush him. He's not going to blow us all up. Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it... You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got. You're not thinking of going after them, are you? Extinguishers. We're on fire! Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...Where these tracks headed? I know. Maybe dinner. Let's load 'em. Screw it, I'm going up anyway. Just listen. And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?! You can't predict this time of year... We'll see... Have you come across Fuchs? What? Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord. How you doin', old boy? Look Blair, maybe you're right about this. But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over. I'm unarmed and I'm coming in. Too damn dangerous. If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it. You play chess? Maybe we shouldn't make it. Maybe we shouldn't. Neither will we. Not the only one. I think so. Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece by piece. We'll see. Let's try Clark. Now Copper, you tie Palmer up. Then I'll have to kill you. For your health. Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down. Real tight. ... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up... What clothes? What are you doing? ... Where is everybody?! I'm half frostbit! Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us. Norris... you stay here... Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren. We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless. And everybody watch whoever you're with. Real close. Oh, shit! Well, hang on! What? We got morphine, don't we. He's gone already! Do it! Torch them!! How the fuck do I know?! Probably the next meal. That's good enough. I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair. Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back. He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl... ... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing. Look, I'm just guessing... Screw the dogs!! Torch it!! Torch it over there! Childs, you got the torch? You get your ass in here!! Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them. I guess you're okay. And if anyone tries to wake me... I'm a real light sleeper, Childs... Would that test have worked? Well, who's got access to it? It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm going to check the last few rooms. What are you doing? Anything? Hey, Sweden!!! Come on, Copper. So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down. Little over two hours. Looks good. Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma... ... we'll do you last... Damn if I won't. Could anyone have gotten it from you? Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on? Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles. I am going after them. Don't let up, Childs! What are you talking?! He's had two months training in those choppers! Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things. Tie up Clark, too. I'm sure a lot of you already know. Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside... We going to make it? Sanchez...? Hey, who... Move it, Palmer. Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight. Then get a move on. Childs, come with me. What's... What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots? I'm going to blow the generator when you get back. He'll have to come for us -- or freeze. It'll come. It needs us. We're the only thing left to imitate... Give me a hand. If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks... We've got to find Fuchs. When we find him -- we kill him. Screw the flashlights. Where the hell were you? Can you think of any other tests? Then we go after him. Calm down and get in your position. The generator! Chance we got to take. We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged. You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen. Forget about Childs. He's over. Anyplace but here. Everything that's been missing. Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole. Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself. When a man bleeds it's just tissue. But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life. When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say. We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood. ... Hey, somebody! Open up, it's me, MacReady... ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped. Been crawling around like a seal out here... Couldn't be possible. Must have weighted a ton and a half... Just keep looking. Well, let's get down there. Yeah! What's happened?! Right. Half of us awake at all times. Who else could have used that key? No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft? So what do you make of it? What for? We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?You promise? Now why'd you go and... Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you? What you doin'? Finish what? When we were up poking around his place... I found this... Cut him loose of the line up by his shack. Somebody's taken it. I can't find it! It's shorted out or something! I'm working it! Nothing's happening! Childs! That a fuse? Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't the judge and executioner around here! Bet the last place you ever go. Maybe it ain't coming. Position, my ass... Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place... Screw the generator!! Get back!! You crazy? He might be inside already? What about Childs? Where was he trying to go? What is it? What are you going to do? Drink it? Bullshit! He's got to know damn well I cut it! This storm do that? That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady. It's in between us and them!! How we going to get back?! It's got into the pub! It's turned on the stereo! Hear what? He's one of them. ... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.After all this mess. Let's just not get worried about anything just now. When was the last time you used it? Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what? It's the generator I think! No power. MacReady, that you? We should sleep in shifts. Somebody else sure as hell thought so. You know damn well what we both make of it. Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy. And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it. Get your gear on. You jerking off or just pissed?He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away. Let's open it. Now... Let's open it. Could have been anytime. Anywhere. Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits. We got to burn 'em. Don't get near 'em. The plants! They're alive. Those things can imitate anything... Childs!! Somebody broke in. Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut. What? Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One? Happens all the time, man. They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America. I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew... He's dead. What kind of test? I ain't going with Sanchez. Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. What I don't get is... Somebody definitely messed with it. Mac, where the hell is that pump!! No it ain't there. Would I be asking if it were there? And that was enough? How's that Thing get to the dogs? I though we stopped it in time. Oh, I got you. Not too long. Blair. He's gone berserk. Four!No. Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station. We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man. It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better. Hey, man...! He might just wait us out. What if it doesn't come? Why? Where were the flashlights? How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who? Can't hear you. What?! You hear that? When do you think it got to him? MacReady...?
