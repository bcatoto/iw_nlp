Yes. I'm fine. Abrams...And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson? How good's your intelligence? What did he find? Why did he go to see Mary Rooney? Yes. Well, of course, it's always dangerous... All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial. No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not. Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff. This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court. The man's an ambulance chaser... Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win? If we were to go to trial, would we win the case? So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me. I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed. No -- we don't want this case in court. ...tell me about this case. Four cases in three years... He was accused of jury tampering. What is the truth? Nothing that we can do can make that woman well. That was our insurance company's recommendation. Yes. We thought it was just. It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...And why, please tell us, would you think that? ...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that? You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years? You've just said you signed it. You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago. 'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is? You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names. Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying? And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today. Isn't that right? Isn't that right...? Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...? ...sworn before God you would tell the truth? Just now... In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right? You would not...? Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime. You are aware of the penalties for perjury...? Objection. Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine. Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there? Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine? How old are you? ...of Anesthesiology? What book is that? How is that? Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...? Orthopedics? Neurology? ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine? Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor? Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today? Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct? And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives. Your Honor...! Your Honor... We've touched on this, his own witness has said... Objection, we've... Ed Concannon. Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here. Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form. No further questions. Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right... Nothing further, your Honor. My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. As long as you understand that. It's got to be that way. Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars. Tell us. You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right? ...to save her and to save the baby. Is that... ...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form... ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did? And what did your team do... ...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen. She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Tell me one? Why wasn't she getting oxygen...? 'Code Blue,' what does that mean...? What did these people do when her heart stopped? Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you? Anything special about the case? You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not? Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right? You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy... Say it. Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor. Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.I did. I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done. Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified. I'm on the staff of... I am seventy-four years old. 'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes. Meth... Methodology and Technique... Through, through his book. I know of him. I'm just an M.D. No. No. No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State... Just as you are, Sir... That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion. You sure you don't want me to stay on. You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth. I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday? I didn't do too well for you. It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage. Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today. There's nothing they can do to me. ...What difference would... ...I made a reservation at... From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case... That's what I'd planned to... It was good of you to meet... I... um... I... given the limits of your question, that's correct. I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.' Well... 'Code Blue'... Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I... ...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I... I am on the staff of... I am seventy-four years old. ...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart. Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she... They gave her the wrong anesthetic.My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know... Yes! ...We did everything we could... Yes. Well, we... That's right. She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask... Well, many reasons, actually... It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins... We went to Code Blue... Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse... Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course... Thank you. When Debby... When she... Yes. Yes. ...I was one of a group of... I was her doctor. Yes. No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient... Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case. She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission. Yes. I. Yes. It is. Yes. I wrote it.Ah. How did they treat you? Good. You ever been inside a hospital? Abrams. Yes. How are you today? Mr. Abraham... That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money. I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money. I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser. I can't do it. I can't take it. And no one will know the truth. Yes. It would be. Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy. You thought it was just. How did you settle on the amount? They want to settle. It means a lot of money. That's the call that I'm waiting for. This is going to drive the ante up. To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify? You know what that would mean? ...he wants to testify...? Gruber... ...yes. Get her on the phone... What are you doing here? Objection! ...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage. ...to get her heartbeat back...? Frank Galvin. We've met before. If I could accept the offer right now, I would. They took it back. I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars. I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case... It's all right, Mickey. Hold on a second. It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement... I completely understand... I doubt we'll have to go to trial... I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here. Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers. No. No. Thank you. You go home. Yes... I... yes. No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home. No, you did fine. Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct? In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six. These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I... ...apartment. No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they... Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my... I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl... I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening... Dr. Thompson...? Thank you. If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...? ...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask? And you wrote that... 'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct? Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar? Uh, why, why are you doing this? Thank you... ...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony... We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss... The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of... The most respected... Do you know who her doctors were? I'm sorry...? Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors... Yes. Yes. The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate... They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much... ...Deborah Ann Kaye... I appreciate -- a man as busy as -- Dr. Gruber... A single hour. And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour? One hour. What did she say? D'you ask the patient when did she last eat? These are your initials, 'K.C.'? You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted... Kathy Price... That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop? Yes. Mrs... You're really... You, are you the one they told me was the nurse? Four. You're great with these kids. Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by. I've been meaning to come in a long time. Hi. How are you doing? Exception! I object, your Honor... Nothing further, your Honor... Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass. And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are. No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair. I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me. If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way... What? Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility? Ready, your Honor. I could subpoena him if I had a week. I had a witness disappear on me. I need an extension for my case. Thank you for seeing me. I'm sure you would. I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro... ...things change. My client can't walk, your Honor. This is a complicated case, your Honor... I was held up. Yessir. I'm sorry. Call the A.M.A. ...I can't talk now. ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse... Thank you. I don't have a goddamned idea. No. No... no... Stop pressuring me... What is that to you...? It's over! You, you don't under... If I don't 'grow up...' Is there going to be a later...? And what makes you so tough? Who told you that? I... I... do you want me to leave? Yes. That's what I am. That's not the question. It's over. Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win. Do you think it's my fault? You're going to stay here...? I've got to work. No, no, I'm just... I've got to work... They, uh, they got to my witness. We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh... I have some work to do... What...? That's what I'm going to try to do. Maybe I can do something right. They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...' Jimmy! That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice. The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink? You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on. My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight. A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name? Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off? Really. How wonderful for you. I'm a lawyer. What Hotel are you staying at? Why? I changed my life today. What did you do? D'you find an apartment? Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center... We have a renew-your-subscription offer... That's why I'm calling, Miss Price... We find that your subscription lapsed... Pardon? This is Miss Costello...? This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions? I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly... Hello, I'm calling from... Let me talk to Mickey. I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent. ...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him... I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number? Mr. Alito, please. You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand... Then why don't you testify? I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them? Who are you protecting, then? Who put my client in the hospital for life. I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand. Then why aren't you testifying for their side? You know what happened. I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big... He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what? I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is? I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure. Yes. We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to... I'm going to see you get that chance. ...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent... ...I understand... ...I understand... ...fifty thousand dollars? Yes. Yes, I have. ...I know. I went... ...I'm sure you do... A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic... It's not a good case. It's a very good case. It's locked? I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in? No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him... I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him... Where is he? I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting... Dr. Gruber. It's a long road that has no turning. Well, well, well. Huh? I want to buy you a drink. ...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...' Everyone. Buy yourself one too. I don't want a mistrial. I don't know. What are you doing in New York...? What the hell are you doing here? Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello... ...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying... The Hospital...? We don't have anything from the Nurse Association? How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat... She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.' 'Kathy Costello...' Uh... the admitting nurse... What difference can that make...? All right... Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand. 'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...' She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand... Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting? Are you with me... are you awake...? That's right. Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness? Yeah. I'm swell. Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her. D'you find the obstetric nurse? I can't talk now. Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it. I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have? Oh shit, what's today? So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case. They still have to take it to a jury. So what? I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse? I'm going to get laid. Jimmy? Bushmills. Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow. I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport... Brindisi versus Electric Boat. Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan. 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up. Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book, 'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.' ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...' They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... Admittance form is wrong. We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point. I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help. Mick, will you help me...? Will you help me...? ...I have to stand up for her... ...he's a good man... You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...' Mick. Mick. Mick... They killed her. And they're trying to buy it... I'm going to help her. ...I'm going to need your help... Come on. Let's get a drink. I have to talk to you. ...hey, I don't need your charity... Sally Doneghy, now who is that? ...now who is that...? Uh... Hi, Mickey... What? I just saw her. She told me. I spoke to her, and everything is all right. Huh. And why is that? Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...? Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat... What happened in those three minutes...? What happened in those three... ...they start again three minutes earlier... Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped. And they resume seven minutes... But those notations stop... ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's... ...of the procedures... ...there are notations every thirty seconds... You have a record of what happened in the operating room... Dr. Towler...To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it? ...that's perfectly all right. I understand. What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...? Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge... Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill? I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were. Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors murdered her. Her doctors killed her. Why? You're going to settle out of court? ...and you're going to do that? Right. Who called? ...Deborah Ann Kaye... I read the hospital report on your client. That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk? Yes? Galvin, right?That's for sure, Frank. Yeah. Thanks, Franky. Another, Frank...?I'm going to uphold that. The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form. It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original... ...one moment, Mr. Concannon... You may step down. I'll rule on that presently. Proceed. Mr. Galvin, rebuttal? Mr. Concannon...? Huh! The Doctors were not negligent. Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question? Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice? Noted. Thank you. Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed... Overruled... Mr. Concannon...? You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail. Are you done? Galvin, look, many years ago... Listen to me, fella... I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today. I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence? Yes, Mr. Galvin? I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...? Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records. Do we have time this morning to... All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon. Defense...? Is the Plaintiff ready? I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you. That happens. You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared. That's perfectly all right. What is it? And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself. I myself would take it and run like a thief. ...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... That's it...? Come on, guys... life is too short... You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it. Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records. I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you. I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it? See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother. Why is that?He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone. He'll be back in a week... If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number... Dr. Halpern's taking all his... He's not in, Sir. Dr. Gruber's not in.It's a common medical term. Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means? She getting good care over there? Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say... What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics? Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please? ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to... Why is that? We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...? I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association. The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago. She wanted to move to Boston. How badly did she hurt us, Joe? Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee... We got to talk. I need a cigarette! She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart... I need a cigarette... ...four years ago... ...yeah... good... The broad has disappeared... The 'History'...? What did she do? All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.? ...one of the other nurses? Read me what she said. The Doctors. Yeah. I'm awake. I think we tried that. The case is over. You use their witness. And all we've got is a witch doctor! How are you holding up? She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to... Yeah? How's our new witness? D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...? What happened, Joey...? Give 'em a box of Macanudos. Today is Tuesday. What? John: gimme a cuesta-ray. What I'm saying, they're getting some help. So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.' Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this. Been a long time, huh...? Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight? You got a good memory, Franky. Right. Right. No. ...Gruber's not bad. Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash. You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance. Who have we got? Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back. ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case. I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...? What? That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer... To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead... You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand? Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life? Are you out of your mind...? Don't touch anything. What do you want? ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file. One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way... ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them... Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy... What the hell do you think you're doing...? What's going on here...? Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail. P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years. You like that story? Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over. Jimmy, gimme another drink. How are you? That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out. ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy. Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case. A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...? Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is? So far you're great. You got a cigarette? Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.You saw Kat in New York... ...or is she in town? Is she in town...? In New York? She did? I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work. We get it at work. We get the magazine at work. Missus... My subscription lapsed three years ago... Kathy Price. Yes. Price... How come you're calling me from...? From the magazine? If you're selling something, I'm late for work... Mr. Galvin's... I can't guarantee that... I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed... Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch... Continental Casualty...As far as we know, nothing. Very good. Nothing. She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
