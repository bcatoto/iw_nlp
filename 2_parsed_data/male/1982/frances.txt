I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words. Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you. Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out. What're you doing? Frances? Oh no. Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy. Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off. Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh? Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up! Well... come on.Come here. I want to show you something. Okay, but come here first. Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house... her bedroom. I can't ask you to... Madam...? Good, good. Give them that. You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it -- You're afraid! Face it! Confess it! You're weak!You're under arrest. Get your clothes on, lady -- Get your clothes on. I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it. Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?" There's a war on, you know? Hey, where's the fire, sister?The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were! No. It's all about that night, isn't it? I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock. Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it! Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing. You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it? Without me. There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh? Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand. Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh? Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name? There've been some calls. You learn your lines?Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again. We're all square now, Harry. Right? Harry! Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job! I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her. Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing. The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.We'll get you home, Frances. We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later. Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you. Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice. I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense? I know you believe that.New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage! Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York. This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel! Were you a drug addict? Were you an alcoholic? ...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?Are you... are you hungry? Please, Francie... But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied. They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know. Francie, you know I can't do that. I love you too, Francie. I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... Always. Always. Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that. What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know. I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you. Be careful, Francie. ...Then go. And you think it's worth all this? You really want to go? Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away. I know. No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation. Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous. Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask? You wrote it, didn't you? An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive. I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances. Bye, baby. That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought. Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway. See you next weekend? I'm going back to the hotel. No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism. They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways. I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve... Thank you. It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.Oh Angela, my own... Angela! No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do! Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...All square, Doc. I gotta go now. Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em? Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow... Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us! Just a little way. Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you? No. I'm not sure. Why do you say that? Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that. Oh, you... ...ennh. Sure I did, that's why I'm here. How... how ya doin', Farmer? C'mere. I want to talk to you. I hope so, Frances. Right. Except... time has a way of -- I don't know. Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap. You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me. This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it. Where to? I love you too, Frances. Frances, it's me, Harry? Frances! Frances! Anyway... if you need me... Frances, You're crazy. You give up on her? It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing. Will you marry me? There's just one more thing. Well... I'll act like I do until I do. Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me? Huh? No. To thoroughbreds. Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground. Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me! What's that? I guess. Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that! Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her. Huh? Whattaya think you're in now? That's right. What? Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch. Forget it, Frances. You're not driving. Evening, gorgeous. You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon. Take a walk, pal. And? You're coming. Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days? Beats me. So you drink, and you fight with a cop...? I'll bet. Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops. Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it. What for? Nice joint. Can you afford it? Think I'll have a glass. Animal magnetism! No ginger beer. What's this red stuff? Frances... Calm down, Frances. Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me? I'm serious, Frances. This is important. The chauffeur. He's watching. Don't start, Farmer. Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits. Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy. What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know? Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better. Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything. If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know? Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid. You're telling me. Is that why you did it? Shit. I meant the other way around. Hey that's great, Farmer, just great. Serious, huh? Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard? Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other. For old time's sake. I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability. He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done. Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job. I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman. How d'ya like the camouflage? Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die. Eight stories. They killed him. They threw him out that window. Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid. Kaminski. Came to get a tan. How ya doin', Farmer? Well... don't you think it's up to me to... Frances... You don't know what you want. Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it. I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life. He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines. You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there. You're not the quiet type, Frances. What? Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it. Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid. You looked okay. Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home? Enh. I just wanted to see how you looked. You think I'd miss it? Harry. I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut. Sure don't talk like you're sixteen. Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy. Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist -- Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you? Yeah, well -- Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here. Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you? Not me. But other people seem to. Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that? I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk. Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh? Hey!Run! What'd you do? Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been? Where you goin'? And no people. Pretty morning.You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late. Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail. Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen -- Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night? You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady. Did you expect him to look you up? Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed? Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation? ...Is that not true?Good! Because, Brothers, that's you! Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country? Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children? And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?Oh. I mean, good. Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics. Excuse me, sir? And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow. You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think. Who're you?'Incurable.' Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word. I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight. I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.Occupation? Address? Age? Name?Sedate her. Frances, I'm warning you... Huh? I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end. Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree? Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review. But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe? And you accused her of tampering with your mail. She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me." Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you? You're telling me you feel guilty. Really? Any problems? ...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit? Is there something else? I'll have someone show you to your room. Stay calm, please. Just a little joke, Miss Farmer. All right. Will you please sit down now? Symington says. And what's that? I see. Please sit down... Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... So it seems. May we be serious for a moment? I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor. Thanks are hardly necessary. I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.No! No! No! No!You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me. Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade? Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean. What about your husband? Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts. Aren't you ever going back? You sound as if you hate it. Why? Why... yes. Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come! Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood. Only if you were in it. Are you? I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?What? You're kidding. Yeah?
