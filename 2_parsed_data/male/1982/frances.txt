Bye, baby. And do you think it's radical for a  man to have a job and feed a family? No! Is it radical for you to have a hand  in shaping your future, and the future  of your children? No! Is it radical for the wealth of this  country to be turned back to the  people who built the country? No! No! Good! Because, Brothers, that's you! Hey! C'mere. I wanna talk to you. Momma told ya not to speak to  strangers, huh? Hey! I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna  talk. Well... you're causin' trouble, you  know that? Not me. But other people seem to. Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I  look like a newshound to you? That's rich. Hey, if I was a cop,  I'd be packing, right? You see a gun? Go on, search me. Pat  me down. Harry York. I work for Martoni  Kaminski, he's running for Congress  here. Yeah, well -- Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna  get your Daddy in hot water, do you? Well... see the papers've got us  pegged as pinkos, then you come along,  the friendly neighborhood atheist -- Right again. You're no more an atheist  than my man's a Red, but what they're  doin', see, they're addin' up their  version of your ideas with their  version of ours. Could look bad for  your Daddy. Sure don't talk like you're sixteen. I suppose not. Gotta ask you this,  though: for all our sakes, you better  keep your trap shut. Harry. Bye. Sure don't walk like sixteen, neither. These are perilous times. With the  economic collapse comes hopelessness  and desperation; and people turn to  dangerous ideas -- Those of us who represent law and  order must be vigilant. Who's behind  this, her mother? Impossible. As her attorney, I've  known her for years. What about the father, he's a little  pink. Maybe he wants to show our  schools in a bad light, shift some  support to Kaminski and those jackals. He's no influence; he doesn't even  live at home. No, I think Frances  wrote that essay with no mischief  intended. It was her teacher who  entered it in the competition. Well, the publicity must stop. It's  no good for Seattle and no good for  the country. Keep an eye on this, will you, Alma? Of course, your honor. It always amazes me, Lil, how you  can whip up a hot, hearty meal out  of thin air. Thank you. I'm... I'm really proud of you,  Frances. An essay contest... a national  contest. That's pretty impressive. You wrote it, didn't you? Well, Harry York is a guy who...  well, he does a lot of things. Why  do you ask? Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry  York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski  right now, and... well... There are  lots of folks in this country who  never got a square break. That's the  way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants  to change it, and when it comes to  new ideas, the people in power get  nervous. No, no, no. All he wants to do is  see the common man get a little  representation. The label's not important, Francie.  What's important is: this country's  got nine million unemployed and  something's gotta be done about it.  Besides: left-wing, right-wing, up- wing, down-wing... they don't mean  much. All a label is usually is a  way to call somebody a dirty name. I know. I have a right to talk to her. She's  my daughter, and she's beginning to  understand why I've sacrificed so  much in order to achieve... They need help, Lil. They pay me  back in other ways. No, Lil. It's just you can't  understand their brand of patriotism. I'm going back to the hotel. See you next weekend? Lillian... I'm more than willing to  meet you halfway. That's a thought, Lil. That sure is  a thought. Are you all right, dear? Francie, you'll learn that sometimes  it's best to stay low and just walk  away. Not bad, Farmer. Not half bad. Art is a constant struggle. Some of  you have the will but not the ability.  For others, the opposite. I don't  wish to be harsh, but only one of  you on stage tonight combined the  two... On cue. This is the answer: a subscription  drive to "Voice of Action!" First  prize is a trip to Moscow! You could  visit the art theatre, maybe even  meet Stanislavski! Yes, yes, it's all arranged.  Everyone's collecting subscriptions  in your name. And the best part is:  the trip returns you to New York. New York, Frances! Broadway! This is  your chance! You belong on the stage! You think I'd miss it? I just wanted to see how you looked. Enh. You looked okay. Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I  take you home? Honest. When you were up there, you  were really... there, know what I  mean? Everyone else looked stupid. Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do  something with it. What? You're not the quiet type, Frances. You know, my old man was an inventor.  Spent his whole life down in the  basement trying to design  transcontinental underground  railroads, stuff like that. Well, I  was supposed to be his partner. When  I told him the smell of his workshop  made me sick, I thought he was going  to die right there. He retired to Florida... made a  killing in vending machines. I kick myself sometimes, but the  thing is, I would have been miserable  living his life. Sure. Try this acting thing. You can  make good money at it. You don't know what you want. Frances... Well... don't you think it's up to  me to... You really want to go? And you think it's worth all this? ...Then go. Has your earlier denial of God led  you to Communism? But Frances, you said -- Better than any American company? What do you think of Stalin? Who? Repent, Frances, Repent! Repent! Repent! Bless you, sister, bless you. Here is a Bible for solace... and  this plant to remind you of the  eternal seed in all of us... and  finally, a flashlight to illuminate  your path through darkest Russia. Be careful, Francie. What do you say now, Mrs. Farmer? One more time. Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers!  They'll lead you safely down the  mountain... No, No arguments. Be my good girl  and go. There's a forest, a burning  forest, and you know what I have to  do! Oh Angela, my own... Angela! What the hell is that? What's she  doing? That's talent, Andy. Oh. How ya doin', Farmer? Came to get a tan. Kaminski. Since when do you believe the papers?  They killed him, kid. They killed him. They threw him out  that window. Eight stories. Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the  sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too  god damn much heart. He just didn't  want to die. He wouldn't play ball. What can I  tell ya... it's done. Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so  I skipped town; came down here to  work for some big-wig. Tail and nail  job. I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman. How d'ya like the camouflage? I always told ya, Frances. You got  real ability. Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya  say we have dinner, then maybe head  out to the beach, rub some of this  tan off each other. For old time's sake. Yeah? What is he -- muscleman?  Lifeguard? Actor? Good. Then it's temporary. All actors are phonies. Serious, huh? Hey that's great, Farmer, just great. This is the suit we fitted on you,  Miss Farmer. It'll do. No one will notice. Oh, Mr. Bebe, good morning. Not bad, Farmer. Obviously. Mr. Farmer, what was your reaction  when Frances told you she had  married... Dwayne. Dwayne Steele. What...? Oh. Well, I was pleased, of  course. Richard... uh, Dwayne, is a  real gentleman. Well, all I can say is: I feel like  I've known these two for years! Let's go. We'll be late. How does it feel to be back in  Seattle, Frances? Isn't she gorgeous? This way. How's the movie, Frances? Can you make some statement about  Seattle, how the city helped you, or  the schools -- Oh. I beg your pardon? ...It's one thing to marry the guy,  but did you have to sleep with him? Shit. I meant the other way around. Is that why you did it? You're telling me. Well, she's back to earth now. They're  all pretty huffed up about your  leaving. I think you better go back,  kid. If they say they love it, they'll  probably love it. Not everybody lies,  you know? Frances, you're a movie star now. If  you give them what they want, you  can get anything. Some people starve, kid. Until we  can do something about it, they might  as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel  better. What're you gonna do, waste your  talent? Why not use it to make  something worthwhile. You can do  that, you know? Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo.  Let me drive you up to that red carpet  in my beat up Chevy. Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin  awaits. Don't start, Farmer. The chauffeur. He's watching. I'm serious, Frances. This is  important. Hot damn! Yes, of course she'll make a statement  on women's rights. Call back tomorrow,  okay? Dwayne Steele's residence. Yes. What...? Yes. Yes, I'll tell her. You learn your lines? There've been some calls. Well... about half an hour ago that  woman from the talent department  called, what's her name? Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired.  Too bad, huh? Yeah. She said she delivered your  message and that you'd understand. There was another call too. From  your agent. He says your summer stock  deal is all set. So you're going  back east, huh? Without me. You weren't going to tell me, were  you? Just pack up and leave, is that  it? Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you  know. I can see you're going sour on  me, and when I try to do something  about it, you turn your back and say  it's nothing. Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn  well better get used to it! I don't suppose it occurred to you  that I might want to leave too, that  I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause  you don't want me along, do you? And  the reason has nothing to do with  summer stock. No. It's all about that night, isn't  it? The premiere. I never pressed you  about it but god damn it, you're  gonna tell me right here and right  now what happened and where the hell  you were! What...? Yes you are. We all are. The first  step is to acknowledge our fear. Face it! Confess it! You're weak! You're afraid! You don't want to show your whole  soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful --  you don't want to show it -- Good, good. Give them that. Madam...? Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad.  I can't go through with this. My  wife is in Europe, but this is her  house... her bedroom. I can't ask you to... Okay, but come here first. Come here. I want to show you  something. And on top of her political  activities, now she's got a lawyer.  She wants out of her contract, Mr.  Bebe. She says she's through with  motion pictures. Excuse me, sir? Well... you could always dump her,  Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There  are a million beautiful girls out  there who don't give a damn about  politics. Oh. I mean, good. Miss Farmer... I've never done this  before... but... I had to tell ya'  you're great! I'm really sad it's closing. Now  what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights? Only if you were in it. Are you? Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to  Hollywood. Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still  in school. But as soon as I  graduate... California, here I come! Why... yes. Why? You sound as if you hate it. Aren't you ever going back? Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts. What about your husband? Will you be getting back together?  When you quit Hollywood, I mean. Is it true you're getting a divorce?  Comrade? Thanks for our chat, Miss Farmer. Be  seeing you. You're wasting your time, lady.  Nothing's off the record with me. Of course it can be done, "Mr. Jones,"  but it's how you do it. There's a  way to pay off L.A. cops and a way  to get yourself arrested. First you  gotta know who to approach -- You Harry York? Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me? Calm down, Frances. Frances... I know, Frances... I know. Good, good. One more time. Because we want to get it perfect...  just the right combination of fury  and confusion. You can understand  that, can't you, Miss Farmer? We're  serious artists here, right? Right. Well... come on. Come on, it's just what you need!  Let everyone see you. Talk to them,  live it up! Look, Frances, I didn't want this  job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged  me: improve your image. So please...  lemme try, huh? Here, take a few of these. Studio  makes 'em in the basement. They keep  the fat off. Come on. They make you feel nice and  peppy. Hi! Bob Barnes! Looks like a swell  party! So nice to have you back, Frances. You wouldn't believe the offers!  Just piling in. I mean piling. Some  of the best scripts I've read in  years! Yes? My employer will be glad to  hear that. Louella? Is she here? How could you miss her? Louella's here and I'm talking to  you? Frances? Oh no. What're you doing? Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is  here. She wants to talk to you, help  you out. Come on, she's an important columnist!  What's the matter? I thought you  wanted these people to forgive you. I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate  choice of words. Gee, awful good to see ya again,  Miss Farmer. My employer would like to know  something very important: is it true  your friend Clifford sleeps in the  nude? Huh? Okay... Hey, where's the fire, sister? Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see  the sign says "Dimout Zone?" There's a war on, you know? I didn't make the law, lady. I just  enforce it. Hey! Santa Monica, this is motor six-sixty- six. I got a live one here. Got any ginger beer? Animal magnetism! No ginger beer. What's this red stuff? Think I'll have a glass. Very tasty. Nice joint. Can you afford it? What for? Well, I would have, you know? I just  didn't know how to cook it. Six months' probation...? You gotta  learn when to do battle, Farmer.  You're not going to win many bouts  with 200 pound cops. I'll bet. So you drink, and you fight with a  cop...? Beats me. Hey look, I got some business down  in San Diego. Whattaya say you come  with me, stay a few days? You're coming. And? Well, like the man said: "You can  make a fresh start with your last  breath." Watch what? That's no way for a lady to talk. Take a walk, pal. Sorry I insulted you... bitch. Hey! Who're you? You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look,  they took your stuff out. Moved it  to some hotel, I think. I'm preparin' it for the next tenant,  he's coming in tomorrow. Never. Never again. I swear, I swear  I will never work with this broad -- You're four hours late! It's insane!  It's unprofessional! Where were you?! Get your clothes on. Get your clothes on, lady -- You're under arrest. Name? Age? Address? Occupation? Hey Frances! Why don't you comb your  hair, okay? ...Is that not true? Answer the question! Have you driven  a car since you were placed on  probation? Have you reported to your Probation  Officer as directed? Did you expect him to look you up? You're on your way to a contempt  citation, young lady. Miss Farmer, is it true you fought  with the policeman who arrested you  last night? Miss Farmer, you were advised at the  last hearing that if you took one  drink of liquor or failed to be a  law-abiding citizen -- That's enough! Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant  disregard for the conditions of your  probation, coupled with the  unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff  here... I am forced to order you to  begin serving a sentence of 180 days  in the County Jail. You are a deeply troubled young  lady... I only hope you change your  course before it's too late. "The kleig-lighted road to fame and  fortune is strewn with heartbreak  and despair. Today film star Frances  Farmer, tarnished by alcohol and  drugs" -- 'm I going too fast for  ya? Oh my God, she's loose! She's attacking your correspondent!  Right here in the Court Building!  Good God, this bitch is crazy! Someone  stop her! With what must surely be the final  act of madness, the curtain falls on  Frances Farmer's once promising  career. The crazed blonde who at Hold it a second, Bub... ...a difficult decision, but, I'm  sure, the proper one. Good afternoon, Miss Farmer. I'm Dr.  Symington. You Farmer? Doc? Hi there. How 'bout a walk in the  woods? You've looked a whole lot better.  C'mon. Listen: to the left. Straight through  the trees and over the wall to your  left. My car is there. Frances! Did you hear what I said? You want crazy? I'll show you crazy! Here. Evening, gorgeous. Forget it, Frances. You're not  driving. Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut  across to Montana. I've got friends  there with a ranch. What? That's right. Whattaya think you're in now? Huh? Who to? Frances, you're fulla drugs. You  don't know what you're saying. Who  do you think put you into Meadow  Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy  and she'll keep on thinking it as  long as it suits her. Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm  not taking you there, and that's  that! I guess. What's that? Hey! Another shot for the lady and a  double for me! Hey, you're a good quarter-horse,  kid, but you can't go a route of  ground. No. To thoroughbreds. Love is so terrific Such a funny  feeling Makes you want to cuddle And  coo... Makes you sentimental, Makes you  kinda gentle Ouch! Terrific thing. Huh? Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask  this one time. I mean it. I swear  after this, I'll never ask again:  Will you marry me? Well... I'll act like I do until I  do. There's just one more thing. Will you marry me? It's not too late to keep going, up  to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing. You give up on her? Frances, You're crazy. Anyway... if you need me... Hello, Frances. You seem to be having  quite a time of it. Frances, the doctors at Meadow Wood  have petitioned the court for your  return. Your mother has asked me to  intervene so you can stay here. You realize, of course, your mother  is now your legal guardian. In the  eyes of the law, you no longer have  any rights as an adult. You're going  to have to hold your tongue and be  selective about whom you mix with.  That man who drove you here, for  instance -- Never mind. We won't have to worry  about him much longer. How ya doin', Al? You got the wrong guy. Name's Slocum. No, it ain't. And it ain't Harry  York, neither. Look, I'm tellin' you... I'd give you till ten, Al, but we  ain't got the time. Alvin Hanson, a.k.a. Ronald Burns,  Thomas Slocum, Harry York... Mr.  Hanson, this warrant has been  outstanding for many years. Normally  that circumstance would prompt me  toward leniency, but the crime you  committed -- inciting to riot -- and  the cause you sought to promote -- a  worker's rebellion -- are such  anathemas to this court that I feel  compelled to mete out the full  sentence. I only wish it were longer. Six months in the state penitentiary. I don't know, honey. Your mother has  such big plans for you. What you have to understand, Francie,  is that she... well... she wanted so  much for herself too, and for me,  and she never really got to... The  only time I ever saw her happy was  if her name was in the papers... but  she could have been... if times were  different she could have been a  politician or... I don't know. Well, Francie, sometimes after you  get your hands on something you want,  it just doesn't look the same. Then  you have to be real smart to know if  you should hold onto it because it's  all you've got... or just let it go.  This is the way of things, but I  guess you already know that. Always. Always. I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk  in my room, and... I love you too, Francie. Yes, yes, Mrs. Farmer -- The point is: it's your opinion that  Frances is getting steadily worse? And you feel you're unable to control  her any longer? And the only course open to you is  to commit your daughter for a period  of time to a mental institution? I believe that's all I need to know  about Miss Farmer. I think in all future documents she  should be referred to as Mrs. R. H.  Richardson. Yes. It's less recognizable. I'm  sure you'd prefer to keep unpleasant  publicity to a minimum. Now. Can you tell us where we might  find Frances? ...From her history, it's apparent  the patient suffers from a paranoid  reaction with pronounced egotism.  Her violent responses have recently  included aggression against her  mother. In view of the deep-seated  nature of her ailments and her failure  to respond satisfactorily to insulin  shock, it is my opinion she may  ultimately require permanent  institutional care. Counsellor, as Guardian ad litem for  Mrs. Richardson, do you waive jury  trial? Yes, your Honor. Having heard the testimony of a  legally qualified and reputable  physician... and being further  satisfied of the truth of all matters  set forth in the certificates of  said physician, I do hereby order  that the said Mrs. R. H. Richardson,  an insane person, be confined to the  Western State Hospital for the Insane  at Steilacoom. So ordered! Are the gentlemen from  Steilacoom present? What's she getting, anyway? Standard series to start. Fifteen? Can I push the button on this one? Sure. I know you believe that. I'm afraid not. You see, we observe  things that you're unaware of: signs,  indicators. Your problem cuts very  deep, Frances, and we have to get at  that deeper stuff so that when you  do get out, you'll really feel secure.  Does that make sense? Listen to yourself, Frances. The  resistance, the anger in your voice. Be patient, that's all. Take an  interest in your treatment and don't  dwell on your resentments. You'll be  yourself again, I assure you. We'll talk more about this. I'll see  you later. We'll talk. Frances! Frances! Frances, it's me, Harry? Watch out, Harry. Let me look her  over. Oh, God! Let's get her out of here  tonight, right now! Let's take her  with us! The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets  out legally, they can't come after  her. Look at her! She'll never pass that  sanity test tomorrow... I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just  hold her. Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll  clear her head. She'll wake up feeling  smart and sailright through the  hearing. Yeah... she knows about these. Shut  her up. You'll be okay, honey. He's just  givin' you something to make you  think, so that tomorrow you can tell  'em what they want to hear, okay?  Tell 'em you were crazy as a loon  and they cured you and you're  grateful. This stuff takes pretty quick. Let's  go. Let's get out of here! I'll lose my  job! Frances, we gotta do it this way.  Just remember tomorrow, remember  what I told you. What're you gonna  tell 'em? Harry! I gotta go now. We're all square now, Harry. Right? All square, Doc. Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you  again. I love you too, Frances. She's... not... normal...! Who did your hair, Frances? What do you think of all this, Mrs.  Farmer? Where to? This is it, kid. This is our chance.  When you got a chance, you better  take it. You don't need to screw around  anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele  or Odets or your mother. You need  me. Been a lot of years, you know. A  long time waiting. For what? End up  feeling like a sap. I don't know. Right. Except... time has a way of -- I hope so, Frances. I'll be seeing you, kid. Pretty morning. And no people. Where you goin'? Yeah, I know what that's like...  Where you been? What's the matter? They're looking for you, huh? What'd you do? I've got a little whiskey here, warm  you up. Run! Francie, you know I can't do that. They'll just catch you again, Francie.  Besides, your mother will know. But I gave her my word. Besides,  she's still your legal guardian. My  hands are tied. Please, Francie... I'll try to protect you, Francie. I  will, I'll talk to her. We'll have a  real talk. Are you... are you hungry? ...Best deal I ever made. Twenty  bucks to fuck a fuckin' movie star. Yeah, it's worth it I guess. What's she saying, anyway? Who knows. She's crazy, ain't she? I don't know why they even bother.  She's had enough of this to knock  sense into a bull elephant. Yeah? I checked the files. This one holds  the record for shock treatments.  Four hundred seventeen and no end in  sight. You're kidding. Yeah, well, you know doctors. They  sure hate to use that word. What? 'Incurable.' We'll get you home, Frances. One merely inserts the leucotome  beneath the eyelid and presses up  into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating  it so as to sever the nervous  connections between the thalamofrontal  radiation and the body of the brain. Because of the speed and simplicity  of the operation, I am able, as you  are seeing, to perform the procedure  on ten patients in less than a half  hour. The operation is completely painless  and can be performed without any  sedative whatsoever. We have always known that this form  of radical treatment was effective,  but until now it couldn't be applied  on a large scale. The old procedure  required a full day's work by a  surgical team to perform a single  operation. In the same time, working  alone, I can treat fifty. This procedure works best on patients  with extreme over-reactions to  emotional stimuli. It can also be  used as a last resort on those who  seem impervious to other forms of  treatment. In plain language, my technique severs  the nerves which give emotional energy  to ideas. Along with the cure comes  a loss of affect... a kind of  emotional flattening... ...with diminished creativity and  imagination. Patients become like  good solid cake with no icing. But,  after all, it is their emotions and  imaginations that are disturbed. These patients will soon be leaving  the hospital. Lobotomy gets 'em home. Uh... excuse us, Mrs. Farmer. We're  going to have to... uh... Yeah, I better pack it in too. I think we've had enough. Thank you,  Mrs. Farmer. Goodbye. ...Dwayne Steele divorced you, and  from this point on, your story takes  a darker turn. Shunned by the  Hollywood you criticized so harshly,  alienated from your family and  friends, you turn your back on  professional commitments in New York,  and alcohol and drugs enter your  life. These are sad, desperate times  for you. ...until finally your mother finds  it necessary to commit you to a state  mental institution. Were you mentally  ill, Frances? Were you an alcoholic? Were you a drug addict? ...and over 200 producers have been  invited to watch your appearance  here tonight... so who knows, Frances  Farmer, anything's possible on your  comeback trail! And since your friends tell me they  have to drive you everywhere, look  what we've got for you! A brand new 1958 Edsel! Thank you, Frances. And after the  show we're hosting a reception for  you and your friends at Hollywood's  own Roosevelt Hotel! So, Frances Farmer, this is your  life. Good night. God bless you. Hey. C'mere. I want to talk to you. How... how ya doin', Farmer? Sure I did, that's why I'm here. Oh, you... ...ennh. Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that. Why do you say that? Frances! I'm not sure. No. Yes. Would you like me to walk a  little way with you? Just a little way.
