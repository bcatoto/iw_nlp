No tongues, Father. All lunar shuttle landings are handled by these computers and simulated on these video units. You're programmed on R-two-niner and locked, Lunar eight six.  Over. It's out of our hands now, gentlemen. Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing. And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let me talk to them. And I'll be the one they'll hang if there's a screw-up. Well, you tell the boys on the board to tell the boys downtown to let the boys in Washington know that the press has been nosing around my people in the front office. Commissioner. I just wish it was that simple. This is Mercury One control.  We have condition green.  Mark launch 'T' minus two hours and counting.  I repeat, we have condition green. What is it, doctor? This is Mercury station six!  Get me the Sarg and fast! Would you like to buy a rose to help bail out Chrysler?  We're an all-profit organization and need all the money we can get. Here. For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission. Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run. Women and the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl. You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz. And that's an order, Lieutenant. Marge, you better go without me.  We've got a condition red. Is there someone else, Marge?  Is that it? Don't wait up for me, sweetheart.  We're testing the retro-rockets tonight. We'll talk tomorrow, hon.  I promise. That's us. Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad? We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury. Can I help you folks? Thanks. Is that your puppy, son? Yeah, his name is Scraps and he's going to Mercury with us. No dogs are allowed on the shuttle, son. But they said... Scraps will have to be shot.  I can do it for you here if you like. Scraps!!! Just joking.  Blanks.  See, Scraps is fine. If we can't fit you under the seat, you'll just have to be locked up with the luggage. There's no way this wiring could have passed inspection without Simon Kurtz's okay! Just patch up the damage and get that ship ready to fly.  That's an order, mister! You've got it, mister.  But you can tell your boys on the board for me that this thing stinks to high heaven of kickback. You heard it, boys.  Now, what do you say? Fuck him! Ted Striker was right six months ago when he test-piloted this sucker.  And what did he get for telling the truth?  A one-way ticket to Palukaville. Who could have figured it would come to this.  It'll be twenty years this week that I lost my entire squadron over Macho Grande.  Planes, too. You're too low, Striker!  You're too low! After the war, I couldn't go near anything with a pair of wings. That is, until fate dropped me on the seat of my pants at the stick of a 167 into Chicago with no crew. It's funny how fate can make heroes out of cowards. Then came the job offers. The publicity. Even the key to the City of New York. Now look at me. Senor Ted! Traficante de drugas o communista? Traficante de drugas, traficante de drugas! Traficante de drugas o communista? Communista! We've lost all our travelers' checks! Calm down.  What kind were they? American Excess! I'd say you're fucked. Next thing I know, I'm the chief test pilot for the XR-2300, NASA's first Mercury shuttle.  That is, until I report she's got more flaws than the Titanic. Now I'm testing old F-l8s for some crazy Generalissimo who thinks there's a commie behind every tree in the Amazon. Senor Ted!  Look! My God!  They're launching the ZR-2300. Do you know what that is, Jose? The muffler bracket for a '78 Pinto. No, that's an XR-2200.  The XR-2300 is the Mercury shuttle.  They can't do it! Taxi! Houston, Texas. Houston, Texas, senor?? Right at the corner, left at the light. Here's a map and step on it! We finally made it, Ma.  Mercury.  We're gonna start all over agin.  A whole new life. Where the soil is rich. And the union strong.  Where men are free to realize their true potential. Can I help you? Where black men and white men, working together, can move mountains. That'll be eight hundred and seventy-four zillion quastavitas. Here's three bucks.  Keep the change. Thank you!! You folks need any help? Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist? It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work. Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it. Say, wasn't that Dr. Barrington, the world-renowned agronomist? That's right.  Are you familiar with his work? No, but the missus sure is. I have to stop that flight. Don't worry about the Viatex account. It's a buy-sell option.  We can't get hurt in either case. Just keep on top of their legal people, Bob. Don't sweat it. We can take your in-flight dinner orders here, if you like.  Today there's lobster or rack of lamb. The lobster sounds nice. Where can I find mission control? Information's over there. Thanks. Today there's the swill or the slop. The slop sounds nice. What's the fastest animal on earth? The cheetah.  Next. Yes.  Next. Over there.  Next. Mission control? It's over therrrrrrr! That's strange.  I just came from over there. I'll meet you on board.  I've got some business to attend to. Frank's the best pilot in the program. I guess this is a first for you. Elaine. That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk. Are you on the Mercury mission? That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return. It's got to be stopped! I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why. You're still crazy, Striker.  Come on, sweetheart. Elaine, he's still sick. You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker. Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures. You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications. I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown. Sir, these are the designs for the flight uniforms.  I think the captain's is to die. Good, good, no, no, good.  What's this?! I said no studded dog collars, Jacobs. You won't get away with this, Simon! Ask Simon. There's nothing wrong with me! You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine! It's all here in the design specifications! Look!  It's all here! Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East. So mentally ill? I'm perfectly sane. Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing. Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist? I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go. Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore. Elaine. Elaine, what happened to us? Elaine, someone has to listen to me.  I'm going right to mission control. Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since. Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way. It works... No, it doesn't... Yes, it does. It does work... No, it doesn't. His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says. No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go. That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go. Carol's not going to give me a divorce that easily, Jane. You're the one who's not making sense, Jane.  Carol's not the violent... Carol! No!  This is senseless! I might have two tens. When is this senseless killing going to stop? Senseless or not, Sergeant, there's a pattern here.  This is the 12th victim this week with a chalk mark around the body.  I want this whole area cordoned off!  I want everyone in this terminal booked and beaten until they talk.  I want an M.O. on everyone who has seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC and I want the entire population of Hawaii off that rock and into the water within one hour. Sergeant.  I said cordon off, not accordian off!  Now dust this area for prints. And run a check on their plates. Super!  Great!  Super!  Terrific!  Super! That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago. I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one. You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled. Jacobs, pull Oveur! Not in your size, but I have a cardigan. Captain Oveur? Mr. Kurtz, I presume. We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything. Chanting or non-chanting? This is Mercury launch control at "T" minus fifty-eight minutes and counting. All systems are go.  Clear launch area. I said 'launch' not 'lunch'! That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians. Do you think it's necessary to explain everything? I'll meet you on board.  There's something I have to take care of first. I have to see Bud Kruger. Do you have an appointment, sir? No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death. You'll have to be more specific than that, sir. All right, it's a matter of death. Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock. You can't go in there! Don't try to stop me! But that's not a door.  The door's over there. That's strange.  I just came from... This is Mercury control at "T" minus fifty minutes and counting.  Commence loading of passengers requiring special boarding assistance. We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes... I don't want to hear that word! All right. Here. Insurance.  Everyone buys it. Time, Newsweek, the Lifesavers, and the second time bomb from the right. My God, Dr. Spock!  You've got a meltdown in the Reggie Bars! I'm telling you, Edith, space travel is safer than driving a car. Mercury seats.  I got a pair.  I got aisle seats, window seats.  Check 'em out. Gentlemen, this is Captain Oveur.  He's taking over for Frank Morgan. What's the problem? Morgan was senselessly murdered about an hour ago. Murdered?  I hope it's not serious. We won't know until after the autopsy. Of course.  Welcome aboard, sir. Good to be aboard, gentlemen. Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn. Unger. Oveur. Oveur. Dunn. And I think everyone knows Elaine. Is flight to Miami, yes? No. Thank you.  Thank you. Open. Mercury, Krista.  A whole new world to be depressed about. Will we die, Pappa? We all die, Ingrid. Will we die soon, Pappa? Soon?  What is the real meaning of 'soon'? Atmosphere control. Atmosphere control, check. Anti-gravity. Anti-gravity, check. I hope that weather doesn't give us a problem. What's your temperature reading, Mr. Unger. Ninety-eight point six. There seems to be some fog rolling in from the west. Mike, give me a density reading.  I just hope it's not too heavy. The fog, the fog, the torment clouded my mind.  Derision, contempt... That's heavy. No! There's a whole new world in front of us, Ma.  Where the dictatorship of the proletariat will lead workers and peasants into socialism without the revisionist diversions of bourgeois liberals, Trotskiests, or disillusioned Maoist terrorism. Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle; Ted Striker. Jack, I got a bad feeling in my gut about this mission. What'd you have for dinner? The fish, why? We should be ready to launch as soon as this fog lifts. Thanks. Elaine. I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight. Let me by, Elaine. Elaine! Whenever your're ready, Captain. Yes, sir, commander. This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down. I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle! Not now, Elaine! Mark 'T' minus twenty and counting. Gentlemen, let's get this bucket into space. Ignition set. Mark 'T' minus thirty seconds. Ignition. 'T' minus nine, eight, seven... Six, five, four... Three... Stop!  One shot. Wonderful! Two, one. You have lift-off, Mercury One. Jettison booster stages one and two. Booster jettisoned. Shut down accelerators. Accelerators down. Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications. Negative. Negative. Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this. Hallucinating again, Rhonda? Maybe it's the brand of glue you've been sniffing.  Why don't you try this, NO-HI. It gives you all the pleasure of glue without the brain damage. Something to read, sir? Do you have PSYCHO MONTH? I think so.  Here you are. I don't read a whole lot, but what have you got, hon? Let me try that Talmud. Oh... Popular Electronics. Wanta switch when we're finished? Here.  I need some oxygen. Have you got it straightened out now? That's my girl. Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago. Can I say something of a personal nature to you? You have great tits. Roger. Yes, Mary? A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over. No.  Poached.  Over. Just poached on toast.  Over. That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over. Poached!  Not over!  Over! That's okay. I said, no! I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us. I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury. Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad? It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with. No more headlines about the rape trial and the fraud charges? How many kids get a chance to live on another planet. No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'? Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!! We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir. You better check it, Unger. Done. Yes? Elaine. Elaine, we have to go back. Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum. Then you do think I'm insane. What word would you use, Elaine? What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face. There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg. I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it. I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me. We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore. People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own. Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged. I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time. Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time. We laughed when times were good. Even when times weren't so good, we still laughed. But most of all, we laughed when we felt closest to each other. That's our story. Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four. You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship. Dunn. Sir? You better take this. Now what? That's an asteroid field.  There shouldn't be anything like that in this sector unless... Unless? Unless those sunspots are interfering with our scanner or... Or? Or we're off course, but... But? But we couldn't be off course.  Our coordinates are computer-locked barring... Barring? Barring a computer failure.  There was talk of sub-par wiring in this ship.  I hope that's just talk. Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name? Scraps. Can I hold him? Sure. He's a boy dog. Yeah. Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy? They kept me in the asylum for eight months.  I know everyone in those places claims they're sane, but I was different, I was sane. Striker, listen to me!  This is Doctor Krane!  You're twisted around, Striker. You've got to come out feet first!  You're too low in the womb!  You're too low, Striker!  You're... ... too low... Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that. There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven that. Do you want to talk about it, Commander? Did you feel that? Felt like a large asteroid. What is it, Mary? Hand me your cup.  This is very hot. Thank you.  And, stewardess, can you please tell my wife that there is nothing that can go wrong.  I think she'd like to hear it from you. I see.  What do you think our alternatives are? Roger. I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine. Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit. Have you tried it with a little cinnamon? Captain Oveur, Dunn and Unger have been sucked out through disposal unit four! Both together?! All right, calm down.  Here's how we're going to play it. Mary, I want you here.  Testa, you move across here past Dawkins' pick and get the ball at the top of the key from Irving. What are you doing, Captain? I wouldn't do that, Captain. Pills... Pocket... Vent... Gas... Yankees... four... We're off course, heading right through that asteroid field and right at the... at the sun! You're right.  They're off course and heading right for the sun.  I've seen enough, Bob. Get me Jack McCrosky and fast! McCrosky?  He hasn't handled a tower in twenty years. Ever since Reagan fired the controllers, he's been completely senile and hasn't done a day's work. What about McCrosky? Pretty much the same as Reagan. Get him. Mets... nine... Phils... three... Cubs... four... He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun. We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down. My career is shot. This is flight to Miami, yes? What's that mean? Are you telling us everything? I've always loved you, darling.  I was unfaithful just once.  Remember Jill, my first secretary?  Forgive me. That's all behind us now. We're going to crash!! God is great!! Death to America!! The yellow pencil is on the table of my aunt!! Yes, sir. Yes, sir! Welcome home, sir! Here are the navigational charts, sir. Yes, sir. Here's all the available information on the sun.  That thing's hot, sir. First the earth cooled.  Then the dinosaurs came but were too big and died and everything got rotten and turned into oil and the Arabs bought Mercedes Benzs and then there was the best TV special on Judy Garland.  Then we lost the war with Albania.  Then... Come in, Mayflower.  This is mission control.  Over.  Come in, Mayflower! Over! Do you want to talk about it now, Commander? Are you a nurse? Can I help? We should be out of this momentarily. There's nothing to worry about. Damn!  I want that patient shot on sight! Maybe you gotta be crazy to end up behind the eight ball like this.  Anyway, you find out pretty fast who your friends are when you're on the lamb. I'm going out for cigarettes and a fifth of bourbon.  Don't wait up for me. Virgin wool.  Nothin' but headaches. I travelled at night in the shadows.  I didn't want to attract attention. I was afraid to step out of the doorways. You never know what to expect when you're on the run. There I was, minding my own business when I looked up and saw a pair of legs that went forever. But I had a date with Harry's.  It was little more than a hole in a wall on the south side of Chicago. Harry's was perfect for me.  The kind of place you go if you don't want to be recognized. It was rough, real rough. The kind of place you could score anything, from junk... ...to Phil Donahue's book. At Harry's you could count on a fight breaking out almost every night. And I say essence precedes existence. You're crazy!  Existence precedes essence. Essence! Existence! There was a small trio in one corner. And a larger trio in the other corner. The last thing I wanted was Elaine to see me down on my luck.  Well, it was just my luck.  In she walked with a group from the space program. They'd come to Harry's to slum it and try their hand at the video bull. Elaine made that ride look easy.  It was obvious why I was still nuts about her. She loved life.  I didn't want her to notice me so I borrowed a pair of dark glasses. Grabbed an alto sax and joined the group. I stayed in the background not wanting to draw attention to myself. Then what happened?  Elaine's crowd talks her into joining us for a song. Come in, Mayflower.  Over! Striker. Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship? That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out. Then Elaine was right. Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way! Pull yourself together!  We've got to... Father, what should I do? Do you want to talk about it now, Commander? Let me try, sir.  Come in, Mayflower. Over.  Come in.  Over.  Damnit! Let me try, sir.  Come in.  Over.  Damnit! Let me try, sir. Give 'em the lead! Everything will be okay.  Pass it on. Are you feeling okay, mister? I'm feeling just fine, son.  Just fine. Do you read, Mayflower?  Over.  This is mission control.  Over. Maybe she's got her shit together. Elaine! Elaine, what's going on? Packers... seven... Vikings... three... We all make mistakes, Elaine. That's all behind us now, Elaine.  And no matter what happens, I want you to know I've always loved you. This is Mayflower One calling mission control.  Do you read me?  Over. The name's Ted Striker and I'm sitting down and facing the front. If you say so. Could be those sunspots. Could be your dishwashing detergent. Me!  Me!  Me! Forget it.  I was reading. What's the story? I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner. Sir, we've restored radio transmission. Give it to me straight, McCrosky -- what's it look like. Not the radio, the situation.  I want to know exactly what your people think. They're screwed. They're dead. Did I leave the iron on? Billy, if we get through this thing alive, I'd like you to get this letter to my mother. An electrical fire in the core has played havoc with the ROK-4000 computer.  It's locked us on a direct line with the sun and there's no way we can go to manual. Captain Oveur already tried it and he's... Giants sixty... Rams... zip... ... become an intolerable bore.  The rest of the crew has been lost �and we're out of coffee.  Also, we're starting to feel the sun's heat pretty bad. It's eight-thousand square feet with great parking and a twenty-year lease with option to buy. You can't lose, Al. He can lose.  I've seen it happen a thousand times. I wish I could talk like that -- so macho yet so sensitive. I'm afraid you gave the wrong speech. McCrosky.  I'm not your problem.  It's this ship.  That computer's gone bananas. The cabin temperature is rising.  The passengers want to know what's happening up here. Let us handle this end of things.  Now what's the coffee situation? It just won't drip!  I've tried everything.  And the passengers are dropping like flies from the heat. Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can. It doesn't look good.  The drip seems to be jammed up pretty bad. Did they change the filter and wait for the brew sign to light up? To tell you the truth, sir, I don't really know. Eighty-three.  What's that mean? If eighty-three passengers die, you win the two hundred bucks. Mr. McCrosky, Mr. Coffee.  Coffee, McCrosky. I won't come down for another couple hours. Not to my knowledge. Four alarm fire rages through downtown Buffalo! Mercury shuttle heads for sun. Four alarm fire guts Tokyo apartment. Mercury mission in death struggle. Four alarm fire in downtown Moscow clears way for glorious new tractor factory. Capitalist, imperialist adventurism ends in space disaster. I never forget a face.  'Texas doctor claims sex with chicken cures baldness?' Have you got the back panel off the brew manifold? Check. There's a terminal at the base of the coil.  That's your contact point. Is this a coffee bean? He's got a bean!! It looks like the solder point has melted. Just what I thought.  When the hell will you people realize that adding extra water after the initial brew cycle overheats the system!!  Now listen to me, Striker, and listen good. Who's in charge here, Mister? Hallick, homicide. Jacobs, Pisces. Kruger, Sagittarius. We have information that one of your passengers is carrying a bomb and might be suicidal. We have our methods. And what methods are those? Have you heard of the Heimlich method? Exactly. Good.  This is the passenger's wife.  Mrs. Joe Salucci. The way I read it, blowin' up a plane in space leaves no traces, if you know what I mean. I'm not exactly sure what you mean, Captain. No blood.  No body.  No bones.  No eyes. No ears.  No throats. He's impotent. And he's stupid! This is it, Striker.  You got one shot and one shot only. Contact. Here are the tests we ran on their computer.  I had them �xeroxed for you. Upside-down, but I turned each page over and put them in order.  I'm afraid that computer is totally capable of taking control of that ship. These are their position calculations. They've got about ten minutes before they start to burn up. Sir, your headlights are on and your doors are locked! Not now, Elaine. We're closer to the sun than I estimated. Come in, Mayflower.  This is Bud Kruger. Over. This is Striker. Look, Striker, I don't know how you got into that driver's seat but I want Simon Kurtz on that radio and I want him now! Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program. Striker, you're heading right for the sun, so don't you think it's a little late for that bleeding heart liberal crap now? Call me a bleeding heart, but if we get through this thing I'm preparing a paper on alternative spending directives recommending the transfer of space program funds to low cost housing. Just put Kurtz on that radio!! Someone's car wouldn't start. I'll get the cards and bridge mix. That's my little girl, my little darlin', my sweetheart, my honey, and you want to blow her belly out with that bomb.  If you blast here in the computer core and the fuselage doesn't give way here and the main communication lines to the cockpit hold here and this baby here doesn't jam this little old unit up here and throw about two tons of hot steel through here like a hot knife through butter and the upper and lower... I have no point. No sir. Should a man in his forties have a circumcision? Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something. That might be the news we've been waiting for. Roger. Which passenger is Joe Salucci? He's carrying a bomb. No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge. Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him. Don't anyone move! Mr. Salucci, listen to me. Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people. I don't want to live anymore. Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance. What? That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you. You're sure? I'm sure. That's the guy from the terminal who can't get it up!! He's got the bomb!! This is just like an election in Iran. This heat's getting unbearable. I think... ... No. We could knock out the wall between the cockpit and cabin, and hang plants. I think... ... No. You can't knock that wall out.  That's a support wall, asshole. I think... No. Did I flush? I know what you're going to say, McCrosky -- knock out the wall between the cockpit and cabin and hang plants. Why, you'd have to be crazy to try a stunt like that. You're too low in the womb, Striker! You've got to come out feet first! Elaine.  I'm going back there. How about a show just like Hollywood Squares but with kids.  Gary Coleman could host. What are you doing, Ted?  Why are you wearing that mask, Ted? I've lost the ship and now I've lost you, Elaine.  I'm getting out. Maybe. I'm saying, I can't take the singles scene again, Elaine. You want to talk about it now, Commander? Houston, sir. This is the President... What?!... What?! Damnit, Mister, the dignity and integrity of this presidency depends on the success of that mission.  And that's my last word! What's our strategy on this one, sir? I work for the people of these United States, Frank.  I have to do what's best for them. Al, kill social security, cancel school lunches only for the poor, dismantle welfare, close all hospitals and public toilets, green light the MX-6, invade Brazil, and bring my horse around after my nap! Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now. That's right -- premature ejection. The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit. Are you afraid? I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this. Are you afraid? Are you afraid? Are you afraid, Scraps? Now when there's a guy like Ted Striker up there, Jimmy. Now how about a little scratch on the inner thigh? Fifty-six percent of the passengers are afraid.  Twenty-nine percent are not afraid.  Eight percent are undecided and seven percent think Israel should give back Finland. You better strap yourself in, Testa. Mission control, this is Mayflower.  Over. We've got about 60 seconds before that thing blows.  We're set to reprogram for Mercury at zero point five WORP. That's right.  When the bomb explodes we're going to have a ten foot hole in the fuselage and I want to get there as fast as I can.  I know what this snip can do, McCrosky. Last spring we did Europe in nine days. We've blown the computer! Elaine!  Set course change! Now! Here goes. Point five WORP! Al Hammil? Not anymore.  It's Rex Kramer, now. No, Rex Kramer. I know this guy, Ted Striker.  I flew with him during the war.  He was a crack pilot but he didn't have it in the crunch... That is... Until that day over Chicago.  He brought that busted up 767 out of that storm like a paper glider coming outta the baby blue. But flying that shuttle is a whole different ballgame. What's the latest, Lieutenant? They'll hit our atmosphere in about three minutes, if they hold together.  They've lost their computer and are coming in at zero point five WORP on manual control, sir. Down scope! He'll never bring that thing in on manual, but I guess Striker's their only hope. It's his ship now.  He's the top dog. The big man.  The numero uno honcho. The head cheese. Sir, we have radio contact. We're travelling at one half the speed of light.  There is nothing to worry about. However, you might experience some temporary metabolic changes. Striker, this is Rex Kramer on Alpha Beta. Do you read me?  Over. That's right, Ted.  Rex Kramer.  We've locked you on track beam.  You're going to have to kill those WORP engines in exactly thirty seconds.  Over. Now, Striker!  Kill WORP! Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand. Try another handle! There are no more handles, only switches. No buttons?! Just switches, lights, and knobs. I'd give my right arm to get just one of these buttons or levers up there right now. Okay, Striker.  You're going to have to pull that lever panel off. Screw driver! Now find a piece of metal and stick it in there. Thanks. I've got something that might work. A bobby pin. What the hell is a man doing with a... forget it. It'll have to do, Striker. It's working. Okay, Striker.  We have you on visual. Just keep her level. She's coming apart! Keep her nose up!  Don't fight her! I'm trying but she's fighting me! Now, Striker, there are a few things you have to keep in mind as you get close to the planet's atmosphere. First and foremost you have to make one very important decision. Is this a landing you're sure you can make without endangering the lives of your passengers? Now, once you've made that decision you have to be very clear about your responsibility to those people on that ship. Their lives, their futures, their goals and aspirations are in your hands, Striker. We're all with you on this one, Striker. Now get ready to position landing gear, cut engines, and fire your retro�rockets. Timing's of the essence on a lame duck approach, Striker.  Don't fight her.  Hold her steady.  Nose up. You'll be all right!  Everyone's going to be okay! Don't fight her, Striker.  Hold her!  Hold her!  Stay with her, Striker! Now, hit your landing gear and cut those engines! Timing's everything, Striker!  Fire your retro-rockets! Now give her full flap and keep that nose up.  Okay, now! FAR, FAR AWAY IN THE DEEPEST REGIONS OF
