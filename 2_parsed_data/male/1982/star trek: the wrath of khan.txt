You're not going in there -- ! Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there! Would you like to tell me whose are the right hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments? Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes -- It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying? But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists? You okay, Jim? How do you feel? I'm taking this bunch to sick bay. Until now. Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario -- It's like the Garden of Eden... How can you think of food at a time like this? But what if they went -- nowhere? Go? Where are we going? This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim. I can spare me... Khan could be down there! There may still be time... you gave as good as you got. Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm still in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis? I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on? It never rains but when it pours -- What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral? Shore leave, Admiral. I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection. From yourself, Admiral. Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations -- What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies. Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral? Say thank you. Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom. Exactly. Happy birthday. For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens. Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact. More antiques for your collection -- Cheers! Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme. I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring... 'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday... Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship? That's all you have to say?I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out. I have my orders. The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff. We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI. All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out. Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days. ... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant -- He left us. We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is the Reliant crew? Dead? A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering -- Never mind! Hurry! Botany Bay -- oh no! I told you! I told you I saw a -- I saw it -- ! Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI -- You know what she'll say... I suppose it could be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix... We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner. You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order. To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I. I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff. Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information. Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You -- Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him. You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --This is just to give us something to do, isn't it? Come on. But we can't just sit here -- ! So are we, it looks like. Go back. I'm going to kill him. Mother, go back! I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military -- Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa. Who -- Does that about do it? Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous. We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the -- Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner? Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak... Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life... How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy. Mainly. And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son. I was wrong about you. And I'm sorry. So am I. My friends were killed, too. But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them. You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life -- That makes two of us. Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death -- No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected. Are you running away from me? I don't mean to intrude. You can't! We encoded four minutes -- He's on a build up to detonation! It's the Genesis Wave! We appear to have plenty of time. She's making it up! My father was Professor -- I'm Doctor Marcus! We were still there , you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room -- I don't know. Don't you believe it. What are you looking at? Let go -- he can't -- !Yours... is... the superior... Inoperative. No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want -- We'll lose them if they go in there. Departing dark side, Regula. Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly. Sir, we must! We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere. We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw! They won't -- Sir -- our shields are dropping! Locking phasers on target. They're still running with shields down. They're requesting visual communications, sir. Steady on course. All systems normal.Well done, Commander. I see. Helmsman? Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis? Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information? There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife. And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how Admiral Kirk requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth! This is Ceti Alpha V ! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste. Admiral Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails. I shall avenge you -- Raise the shields... Tactical! Full power damn you ! Rake her. Visual -- Well? No! At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you? Where's the over-ride ?? Raise them -- Careful: Not all at once. The engine room . Lock on target and prepare to fire. Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold? It is very cold in space. Let them eat static. It's not much different from Enterprise. When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ? Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens. Perhaps I no longer need to try. Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend... Time's up, Admiral... I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative. Thirty seconds... I give you sixty seconds, Admiral. Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control -- That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think. -- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever. Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life -- You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you. First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk. Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay? Admiral? He didn't tell you how Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us? Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he... ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay , lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze? You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the Botany Bay , marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk. I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it? I never thought to see your face again.Young. I feel young, Doctor. Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours -- We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik. And almost got tossed out of the Academy... Now that's what I call a meal. Our first order of business is survival. Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved. Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all. Where they went. Saavik. They even killed the galley chief. He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt. I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't. At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe... Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary. As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds. The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor. Ah. Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think. And who am I hiding from? Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and... Bones, I don't want to be lectured. Thank you. Amazing! I don't know what to say -- But I'm allergic to Retlax. Uh -- what are they? Cheers. Bones, these are... charming. I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon -- Twenty-two, eighty-three... Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal -- Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods? They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor. I'm not a drama critic. Physician, heal thyself. Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday. It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known... You did this -- in a day?! Why? Why didn't you tell me? Wait -- Carol! What order? Who's taking Genesis? Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis? Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong? Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong? Is that what you came here to say? I am truly sorry. I'm trying, David. It was just words. Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing. I didn't expect anything. I suppose I was. I poured a drink. Would you like it? Uh, no... I should be on the bridge. We'll beam aboard and stop it -- How soon -- What? It's a long story. Why didn't you tell me? Where's Dr. Marcus -- I'm Admiral Kirk... KHAN! Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target. Here it comes. Now, Spock. I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission. Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word? ... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using our console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields... Give me some time to recall the data on our computers -- Genesis, what's that? Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew. What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant? Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded. I'm going down to the station. We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power? Scotty -- what's left? We'll be going to warp speed -- An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I. Mr. Scott? We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room -- Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right. Sensors, Captain? Do it, while we have time. On screen. Scotty, let's have it. Spock? Picture, Mr. Saavik. Try the emergency channels... Uhura. Can't you augment? He'll die -- ! All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power. No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way. He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance. Mr. Scott, the word is given. Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself. Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise? Midshipman, you're a tiger. Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott? Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well? Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready? Meaning you can't even beam us back? I read you, Captain. Let's have it. Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock? Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line? Yes, Spock. If he hadn't, we'd be space by now. The word is given: warp speed. Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap? I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room? Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston? And who is this? Spock...! ... the good of the few... Yes -- Spock! He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...? Uhura, patch me in -- Steady as you go... Best speed, Scotty... Scotty, can we make it inside? Uh oh. That's it? What IS working around here? Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott. All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours. Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters? Reliant could be hiding behind that rock. ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond? And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area... Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again. You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship. It's coming through now, Khan... It's all we've got. At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry... Who the hell are they? Visual! Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers -- WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And why ? Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to -- Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ? Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he? Gentlemen, this isn't -- The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now -- The power of creation -- Yes. Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom? How far? Will you accompany me to the bridge? Or the one. I would not presume to debate you. You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions. But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you... That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I. I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure? Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate. To be sure, Captain. Yes, we've been through death and life together. Permission to come aboard, Captain? Home. Hrummm... and where are you off to, now? 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock? Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this. So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot�g�'s first rare -- a trifle emotional -- It had the virtue of never having been tried. They destroyed the simulator room and you with it. I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets. Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out. You gentleman can remain here, or... Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within one hour your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range. Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command. Uhura! What's happening? Damn it... In my quarters, Uhura. Kirk here. Yes, well, why don't you show him around and... Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son -- As you were, Mr. Saavik. Dismiss the company. I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer... After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors. Distance from Reliant... Time! Engine room! What's happening?! Time from my mark... Saavik, get us out, best speed! Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line? Cease fire. Look sharp. Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes. Mr. Saavik, all stop. Hold your course. Look sharp... They just don't want us going in there. Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...' Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus... I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking. I don't like to lose. I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship. Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant? What's on your mind, Lieutenant? As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities. If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground. Erased... Phasers on stun. Move out. There is no such regulation. We're finding it. Please, please -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative... HURRY. Khan! This is damned peculiar. Yellow alert. Take the test again. We learn by doing, Lieutenant. That was a little joke. You may ask, Lieutenant. There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character. You're bothered by your performance on the Kobayashi Maru . You earned it. Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems. Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently? Then you have something new to think about. Carry on. How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say? A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you? And why not? Very well. Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship? Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners. Captain. Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready. Battle stations. Try again. I did nothing -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been -- Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command... Scotty! Mr. Sulu... The shields! Visual. Engage warp engines -- Stop engines. You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer. I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR. I really must thank you.Aye... Is the word given? Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star -- I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral. Yes, SIR. Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...! Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation -- The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps. WHY ? Aye, sir. Give the word, Admiral. My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space. I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates. Just barely, sir. A few shots, sir. Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes -- Aye, sir -- Aye, sir.I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically -- But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human. I don't dispute that in the wrong hands -- I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create -- It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix -- I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper. I never took the Kobayashi Maru test -- until now. What do you think of my solution? Or the one. The ship -- out of danger? He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking... Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn. Admiral, they're reducing speed. Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing. I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego. She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four. Best we could do in two hours. Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power... Be careful, Jim... Aye sir -- A distinct possibility. Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space. Affirmative, Admiral. Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's inside the station. Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent... The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code... The prefix code? Admiral, you can't give him Genesis... Not enough against their shields. Too late -- One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power. They knew just where to hit us. Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- ! It would explain a great many things -- What's she doing here? Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests -- Have they proceeded with their experiments? It literally is Genesis... Carol Marcus -- It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was. Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed. There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond. I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets. That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well. Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material. You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise. Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command. Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours. Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves... There's a first time for everything, Admiral. Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you. The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you? None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times. I know of your fondness for antiques. She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example. Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality. The Kobayshi Maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment. As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique? I am understandably curious. I exaggerated. Certainly... Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations. Take her out, Mr. Saavik. Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock? Thank you, Mr. Saavik. Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings. We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical. What did you expect, Lieutenant? No power to the weapons system, sir.Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard. Not at present. Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days. Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power. Admiral, this is Spock.Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife... What do you want with us? I demand -- But the child -- What's the matter -- ? Ssssh! There's an air-lock. You're crazy -- ! I can hardly see -- Are you sure these are the coordinates? All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant. Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment -- Don't tell me you've got something. All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis... I've never even met Admiral Kirk -- Listen to me -- you men and women -- Chekov, who is this man?Sir -- we won't leave you behind...! Transmission jammed at the source, sir. Yes, sir. I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
