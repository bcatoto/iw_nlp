Yes, My Lord. Yes, he commands you make contact with him .... It was .... the Emperor ....Yes, My Lord. We'll find them. Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now. Soon, Lord Vader. Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord. It has entered an asteroid field. My lord.The boy is our last hope. Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon. Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship. You are the last Jedi, Luke. You are our only hope. Be patient. We've come this far ... He is our only hope. He'll learn. He can do it. We've discussed this before. He will learn patience. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now. Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader. Will you? You underestimate The Emperor. It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer. But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side. You're not ready yet. You still have much to learn. You don't know that. Even I cannot see their fate. ... Luke, you must not go. Luke ... you are the only hope. You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me: Yoda, the Jedi Master. You must survive, Luke. You must. Luke, look at me!Howls. Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl. Barks an argument and shakes his head. Barks a blue streak. Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips. Growls a reserved greeting. Barks a doleful farewell. Barks his concern. Barks at Han. Howls and shrugs his shoulders. Barks and growls at his boss. Barks his agreement. Barks his consternation. Howls. Barks his �right on!� Barks his agreement. Barks at his master.The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker. The temperature is dropping too fast. We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ... Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in. I haven't seen him. He probably came in through the south entrance. Yes sir!Yes ... yes. That would be a great asset. You are weak! I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed. The son of Skywalker. You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing. Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction. There is a grave disturbance in The Force.I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well. You'd better chain him until it's over. No, I'm alright. I'm alright. Not now, Chewie. Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down? Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix? That was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you. Well, it's been awhile. Then I'll see you in Hell. You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it. We'll have to go out on Tauntauns. Not likely! Where are the speeders? Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it! Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet? Fine. But they'll have to take care of themselves. Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look. Come on, Chewie. Thank you, General. But there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man. That's right. The Empire won't look for you out here. I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon. There isn't a hint of life in the area. But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling. Good. Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive. Not collapsing, honey. It's closing! This is no cave ... I'm going to see what it is. You, too, golden rod. What are you so grouchy about? We're in trouble! I think we're in trouble. Sit down, and shut up! Transport XJ. get out of here. Go! The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold. He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie. Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon. I shut it off. What's her royal holiness want? What is it? ... just remember that, �cause I'll be back ... Me either. They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions. I was worried about you. Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ... Well, I do trust him. Lando's an old friend. Must have been an accident. He found him in a junk pile ... Luke! I'm sure he's fine. Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now. Huh? Oh. Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost. He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him. Come over here. I want to check this out. You look great. Who's staring? It'll be all right. Trust me. And keep your eyes open. You wait here. Let �er go, Chewie. No. But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ... A Tibanna gas mine. Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back. Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ... ... your kind of guy. The system is called Bespin. It's a ways from here, but reachable. Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it! Lando Calrissian. Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before. Let me check my logs. Here ... near the Anoat system. Then we have to find a safe port around here. Got any ideas? The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed. Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws. Oh, so sorry! Didn't mean to offend your droid. You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy? Sharp bank, Chewie. Let's turn this bucket around. You heard me, turn around! Full power on the front shield. It's not my fault. I can't under- stand it! Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said! I tell you this time it's not my fault. I'm sure I checked it. I see it Chewie, hang on. Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off! There will be more of them. They always travel in groups. And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now. Look, we just got this bucket going again. I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ... Where? Try and control this ... You mean a man you can control. Sure, they're safer. You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull. What are you afraid of? Why? That's quite a compliment. You could be a touch warmer, though. Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right. Sure. I guess I make it difficult sometimes. Easy, your worship. Only trying to help. They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe. That was no earthquake. Fine with me. But I'm afraid you'll have to let go. Well, I hope you don't expect more. Beautiful. You don't look angry. Why, Princess, this is so sudden. That should do nicely. There, there. Chewie get a reading on that. Looks pretty good. Right. I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ... We've got to get out of this shower. But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. That Star Destroyer is slowing down. Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong. Aren't I? Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'. Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need. Asteroids! Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ... That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us .... Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us. I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what? This baby's got a few surprises left in her. Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started. Hey! Someone's still in here. Who's scruffy-looking? I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this. Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke? Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss? Ooops! I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet. Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer. Now don't panic. We don't know that. Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct .... .... I'm afraid there's not much left. No kidding. If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere. Forget it. Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun. Spare me please! Don't tell me about the Rebellion again. I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion. The result is you're as cold as this planet. There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss. You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one. I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute. But it's too late now, sweetheart. Your big opportunity is flying out of here. Am I? I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss. You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. You probably don't. How could you? You're so terrified of your own emotions ... Not you? We? He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look. Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me. If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else. I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head. That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Yes, Your Highness? Don't worry. You haven't seen the last of us. Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me. That makes a good story. But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight. That's two you owe me, junior. Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base. Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Yeah, you're a real hero. All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him? Luke? I don't get it. You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over. This ought to be good. Get out of here, Lando! I'm sorry too. Nothing. I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well. How's your mining operation going? Hyperdrive. Repairs ... I always said you were a gentleman. No hard feelings?We're not out of this yet. Okay, okay. Three patrol ships are heading our way. What's wrong with him? Everyone's invited, of course. Right. How you doing, Chewbacca? Still wasting your time with this clown, eh? Don't shoot! I've done what I can for you. I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems. I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ... Don't ask me, but he's on his way. He doesn't want you at all. He's after someone named Skywalker. Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. Shut up a minute and listen. I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you. Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. Not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient. I've had supply problems of every kind and ... What's so funny? I'll have my people get to work on it right away. Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart. That ship saved my life a few times. It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy. What's wrong with her? What have you done to my ship? That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway? I'll bet. Are you kidding? Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you. That wasn't the bargain. You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in-- I'll take what's mine now. We only use this chamber for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it'll kill him. No. That was never mentioned. Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain. What about Leia and the Wookiee? I'm sure my men fixed it. We've got nothing to worry about. The deflector shields are gone. Someone's falling. Wait a minute. We're not going back there. What? I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it. I didn't say anything? His fate is sealed. You'll be lucky to get out yourself. All systems are on alert. everything's locked. Don't worry about a thing. I'll get us going. Sure I did ... once. It turned out lousy. Very noble. Not smart, but noble. There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform. This is no time to be choosy, honey. What do you say we debate this later? There's still a chance I can get you out of here. Look, I stand to lose everything by this. I'm coming over to your side, that's what. And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake. Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ... I didn't know you had a price on your head. Vader has given you to the bounty hunter. Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city. It's connected by a transfer shaft. Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial. .... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire. Would you care to join me for a little refreshment? I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled. Truly you belong here with us among the clouds. Sorry, am I interrupting anything? Hello! What have we here? Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?You won't. And that is why I must go. I feel The Force. I can help them! But Han and Leia will surely die. Ben ... Ben ... I'm cold ... so cold ... I can't ... How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Can't we get on with this already? Because of my father, I guess. Will it take long to get there? How far away is he? Look, it smells good. I'm sure it's delicious But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now. ... I told you, I'm not hungry. You know the Jedi Master? I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do. I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it in this slimy mudhole. Give me that! Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't. So ... I'm looking for a great warrior. Yeah ... I'm looking for someone. ... Like we're being watched. I hope you make your peace with Jabba. About what? Probe? What probe? Thanks to you. I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long. I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings. I've never seen it fail. He'll survive. Leia! Snow creatures ... they're here?! Jabba the Hutt? Calm down, will ya? Tell me about Han. Han's leaving? What are you talking about? I have this ... feeling. I'm not sure, really ... Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while? I'm fine. Really. Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things. And sacrifice Han and Leia? I've learned so much since then. And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master. They're my friends. Will they die? I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering. I see a city in the clouds. My mind fills with so many images. Ben? Ben? What's in there? I feel cold. Yes ... I also feel danger ... death. Something's not right. But tell me why ... But how am I to know the good side from the dark? Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger? Price? What do you mean? But I feel The Force flowing! They're a lot stronger than I'm used to. I thought those seekers were set for stun! I don't believe it. I can't. It's too big. Okay. I'll give it a try. Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different. I thought I was in good shape. I will not fail you. I'm not afraid. I have followed my feelings. Why not me? Never. No! .... Never .... Time will tell. I'll die first. No! You'll find I'm full of surprises.It won't get through the blockade. Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away. Yes, My Lord. Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir. We're doomed. Goodbye, Mistress Leia. Goodbye, Captain ... It sounds like it's trying to get in. I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior. Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me? If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged. It can wait. Sir, I was wondering ... The energy shield is down. We'll be stuck here forever. I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning. I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ... I don't know, Artoo. Sir, might I inquire what's going on? She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you. No one seems to know ... Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like. Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you? Artoo, you did it! I never doubted you for a second ... Rather touchy, aren't they. Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Oh my, no! Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable. Closer?! If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ... So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.And code the signal to my private chamber. Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission. The Emperor? Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them. Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough! Yes, Admiral .... soon. Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses. How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me? Come in, Admiral. He will join us or die, My Master. But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally. He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ... Our destruction? Who? I have felt it. What is thy bidding, My Master? I'm altering the bargain. Pray I don't alter it any further. Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them. I think not. But I don't wish my prize to be damaged. We'll test it first. Bring in Captain Solo. Good. It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here. I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city. There is no escape. You must join me or die. Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force. But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him. Do not resist. It is our destiny! The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line. You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me! Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor. All too easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought. That won't be necessary. There is much Obi-wan did not tell you. Come, The Emperor will complete your training. Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true. And I too. The fear does not reach you. You have learned more than I anticipated. I want that ship. Anything on the Millennium Falcon? Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett. The Hoth System?No ... there is another. Told you, I did. Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse. Strong is Vader. Clouded is your fate. Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything! It can save you. Stopped they must be. Do you hear? On this all depends. Will he finish what he begins? He's too old. Yes. Too old to start the training. This one I have watched a long time. All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future. Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing. Adventure, excitement ... A Jedi craves not these things! Much anger in him, like in his father. If it must be. Yes. Yes, yes. To Obi-wan you listen young one. The tree. Remember your failure at the tree! Heh? Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too. You have far to go in your training. Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine! It is the future you see. Bespin. I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh? Concentrate and see them you will. Control, control you must learn of what you see. Not easy, not fast. Free your mind and return he will. Only what you take with you. This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force. A servant of evil it is. Into it you must go. Four this time! The Force you feel. No! Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ... You will know. When you are at peace ... calm ... passive. A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense. Never for attack. No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive. The dark side beckons. But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice. Anger, fear, aggression! The dark side of The Force are they. Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight. Beware, beware, beware of them. A heavy price is paid for the power they bring. No, no. This will not do. Anger is what you feel. That would matter not were The Force flowing through you. Higher you'd jump! Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must. That they are. Concentration. Heh? Concentration. That is why you fail. Size has no meaning. It matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size do you? No. Try not. Do, do. Or do not. There is no try. No! No different! The differences are in your mind. Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you. Yes, but by what standard, ask I? Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn. It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi. You will be, my young one. Heh. You will be. You are reckless! To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. Ready are you? What know you of ready? I have trained Jedi for 800 years. My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
