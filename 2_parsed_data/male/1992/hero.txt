Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John. So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard. Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero. People watching you all the time. Waiting for you to make... a slip. Slip up. There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself. I dunno. It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes. That's good enough for me. You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it. You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right? Just keep me outta prison. Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee. She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph. She thinks you're some kinda holy man. You got it? Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee... Bernie. Call me Bernie. You woulda gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice... Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are. For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity. I wasn't thinking clearly. Listen, I'm no hero, John. I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit? You didn't spend it all didja? I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being around them if you know what I mean. There you go, you inspire this kid to live . I probably woulda vomited on him. Great! You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump. Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards . Well, we gotta work this thing out, John. It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions. Looka those maniacs, willya? They love you, for Chrissake! Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John. Right. What's the big deal? You decided to pretend you were me. A little moment of weakness, right? So I sorta swiped her purse. I got feet of clay too, bUddy. Lighten up, John. You think you got problems for Chrissake? I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John. Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy. Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart. You could, like, rest up for the jump. Jail! Listen, Bubber... This is crazy. We could fall off of here. I was in the can, for Chrissake. I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks... What am I, a goddamn postman? I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter? Put a stamp on it for Chrissake! In private. They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones. I just wanna talk with you for a minute. Then you can jump. You can jump twice for all I care. Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights. Hey, Bubber, c'mere! I gotta talk to you, buddy. Hey, do I look crazy? I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators. "Keep a low profile," that's my motto. Sell it to him. You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride. I got a job, nice apartment. I do okay. One leg! Like the Red Cross or something? Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake! You got a drinking problem or what? Try stupid. Nah, I fucked it up. I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why. I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard. He musta blew up. I got the hell outta there. I didn't have the nerve to face the kid. I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty. Children's Hospital, on the double. TAXI! HEY, TAXI! Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks. TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE! Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff. You are naive. Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare? That fake inspired you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job twenty-five hundred goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna do time ! You're s'posed to be an attorney for Chrissake! You're s'posed to have good judgment ! You whaaaaaat? You paid it? You gave a bondsman ten percent? Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail? If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me? Twenty-five grand is peanuts! All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect. "Angel!" I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong. Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks. Some of it. Right here. I got some of it. I'll get the rest as soon as I can. She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence. Uh, his birthday, uh, May. I think. Often, uh. Involved! Christ! She attached my goddamn paycheck! Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer? You know what I mean. Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced... A son, yeah. What about him? Joey. Yeah, I been calling in sick. They think I got the flu. He gives a good report and I walk? I know what he means. I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day. I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake! Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator. You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country. "Anticipation of incarceration"? Bail, for Chrissake! I'm innocent! What's going on? "Guilty"! What is this? Look, I got this kid. We got a goddamn relationship! I'm takin' him to a movie tonight! He worships me. If I go down what's this do to my son? I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake! Do I hit anybody? You see me shoot anybody? Hey, drugs! Do I sell drugs? Jesus, I don't belong in prison. I'm a family man. Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right? You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer. They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms! Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages... Hey! Do I have a record? Have I ever done time? I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff! Have I ever been convicted of anything? The thing is, Chick. I'm goin' down. Nothin'. I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me? Ya wouldn't, would ya? Yeah, like that. Same thing. What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife? Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore. I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here. You got a right to throw me out. You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all. I cornered the whole goddamn market. You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...? You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know. Those guys been in here? When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being. The thing about kids is, they're so... young! They don't know nothin' yet. When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else. I can't afford no better. My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments. You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance? Nine. I think. Maybe ten. Yeah, ten. Nice kid. My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake. 'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why. I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh? Business thing. Gimme a seven and seven, willya? Some guys been looking for me, Chick? Spanish kinda guys. Bill, I got financial problems and... Bill, listen... Bill, I got some legal problems and I... I... Bill, I... I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life. You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev , it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle. Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important... The homeless! Three weeks, Ev. I didn't tell him I killed anybody... "Elliot"? The heroic goddamn fireman? That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind. Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize. Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened. What happened is... Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood? Is he here, your friend. The fireman? Ev, it's not my fault! I'm trying to tell you this incredible -- You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn! Absolutely fantastic! I'm on my way -- Me? Listen, I don't give no interviews. That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day. Who am I? You're asking me? You're the big expert for Chrissake! I'm what? The "Scumbag," right? The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the... You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people. I got a kid, you know. I'm a person, for Chrissake. Lie, you mean... I'm going to apologize to Bubber? Underbelly! -- saved your... whaaaaaaat? What? Blackmailing...? Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude. I saved your... "Harassed." Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo? The guy's a thief, he took my... What, is everybody in love with this, bozo? I don't get this. What about...? My fault! My fault! This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault? The cops! What kinda bullshit is this? Is this America or -- ? Me! How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake? Hey, put that thing down. This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just... Turn that thing off. You! Mmmmm. Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older. Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay? It don't go no further. What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..? You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy? Well, the thing about life is... it gets weird. See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit . Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another. So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's your bullshit, so to speak. You got that? JOEY! Here we are. Yeah, that's a possibility. A movie. Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time. Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that. She's still like that, right? Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better. Thing is, I got all this business stuff... Thanks. Thanks, pal. I'm working on that. It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter? Me in my uniform. Used to be on the bookcase. You never saw that picture, huh? It was this war. Viet Nam. Doesn't matter. Oh yeah? A hero, huh? Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot? This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh? He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?Looking... good, partner. Hang in there. Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine. Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse. Why not? I had this shoe. I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie. On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything. I can't tell him what we're up to... And give a deposition to the jUdge. --but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie. Almost half. Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La... You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me. Allen? He... he's okay? It was you! I thought I heard... I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me! Huh? Whadda you mean? And she thinks you're blackmailing me? You stole her purse! While you were saving her? What have I done? I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest. You should go in. You're risking your life again... The bathroom! For two days? I never really thought they'd go for it. And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record... I kept expecting you to show up and expose me... That's close enough. It's a confession. The truth. Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante. I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems. That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley. Talk from there. You can talk from there. LaPlante! They interview you or anything? At the plane crash? I know a guy who only has one leg. You should give it to someone with only one leg. In bad weather, yeah. Mostly I camp out in the woods. I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up. I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food. A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying... And you pulled people out? You're... a hero. "A little mistake"! You do? Gale! This is for you. I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything. It's not right, Gale... Bodybuilding! Gale... That's not what I mean... Gale! I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!' A script! I thought we just walked through everything... Vietnam! Uh, right. A... news story. I... no... I don't have the right... I... You... you think I saved your... life. I can't take advantage.... Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way... It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention. A couple of... years. Uh, no. But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and... Is she... serious? A half a million dollars? In my behalf? Yes. Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as -- Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars. I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect... Uh, er... I...Down. You mean jail? For that credit card stuff? For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer... I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern. A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being. It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it. No offense. Me neither. I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy. Heroic. You and me, we're not... heroic. It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined. What about it? Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern? Is this a riddle or what? You mean like Bubber? The hero? I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie. You in business with those guys or what? I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern. Bernie, how'sa kid? We're all assholes, Bernie? I didn't even know you had a kid. You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie? You gotta kid? How old's your kid? Nope. Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney. What is it, five days now I don't see you! Spanish kinda guys!He's gotta be a nut! He saves all those people and swipes a purse ? Swiped your purse! While he was saving you? You gotta be kidding! LaPlante! This guy LaPlante won an award? What is it? What's the matter? Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I... We're gonna wait here? The guy could be hours. I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy... Yeah, I got it. Sports training. You learn to follow the ball. How about you do a wrap-up from up here? I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.How'd it go? WHAT? THEY FOUND WHAT? We're piecing together different accounts and... Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger... There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear... That too. She broke up with her boyfriend. Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis. You're sitting on your ticket. Unprofessional. For ten more minutes they love him, Wally. I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public. What? Helluva story! Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante! She let Channel Eight get a beat on us. She can't quit. Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved. Don't be emotionally involved, be professional. No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are. You are a goddamn cream puff! Try and be a hard-ass! Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything. Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't... "Quit!" You can't quit! It's unprofessional! She's talking to him now. Said he's not an actor. Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite. Never stop worrying. I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town. Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background. Relax, Wally. He had the shoe and the shoe checks out. We're gonna feature Gale's cast more. The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story. But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive... Not bad. But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story. Network's taking everything we give 'em. They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not. We're very big nationally. She's flying to New York. She's been nominated for a Silver Mike... Saving people is not our job. It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off. He's right. It's unprofessional.Mister LaPlante... Mister LaPlante... Mister LaPlante...Reporters don't have hormones? You didn't... get it on with him? Is he like that in real life? So gorgeous? There's no face really, nothing to work with. Big dots, that's all you'll get.Uh, no. Yeah, my dad's great. He took me to the zoo. Yeah. I'll see ya... dad. I could go to a movie Thursday night. 'Cause we don't have school on Friday. Here. Get off here. Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend? What picture? Were you in it? In the war? "The Nomm"? What's that? Sometimes. His name's Elliot. He saved a guy's life one time. In a fire. Dad! What's "cynical"? Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom? I... I saw him out the window. My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here. The "unknown hero." They found his shoe right beside the plane crash. He lost a shoe!Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you. They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants... Excuse me, Ms. Gayley. That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants... I didn't ask him. Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you. From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton. He wants you to call him.I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT MY PROBLEMS. YOU'RE ONE A MY PROBLEMS. GET OUT! OUT! OUT! OUT! I TOLDJA. JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING! AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT? AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET? THAT'S IT! YOU TALKED! YOU'RE FIRED! OUTTA HERE! GET OUTTA HERE! YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN EXCUSE ! IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX." NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE. THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE. DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE! DON'T SAY ONE WORD! DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"The Presidency. The public loves him. It's not unthinkable. No, Deak, not a great story. We backed this guy, he's our boy! We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars. Listen, Deak, what if Bubber has got something to hide? What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...? She wants to quit? Quit? She wants to quit? We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings. He's not supposed to be an actor, that's the whole point. He's a real life hero , all he has to do is act like a real life hero. That's the beauty of the concept , the whole freshness of it. Did she call him back? Upset! What's he upset about? Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him? I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something. What about a reward for coming forward? It's a wonderful piece. Emotional. I love it. A Silver Mike! You're covering us in glory! Ticket! What's going on? You wouldn't push the guy, would you? If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself. An hour after...! Deak, for Heaven's sake! Let's give her a night in New York City. We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel... You didn't? Never reach out!No dead body. Too bad. Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive! Half the time he don't answer even if he's home. Know why? 'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him. I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends. Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley? Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me! "This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!" Incredible. Unbelievable! For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now? 'Cause he stole paint ? LaPlante! That asshole! I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
