How about any guys on your staff? I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently? Is it your vehicle? I'm afraid it's the "van" again. That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living .. Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down. We're not here . I don't want the desk to hear us .. Hit those wipers, Ross . What d'you mean, "bits." Bull shit .. I'm in my prime .. I guess by the bed. Listen, you don't havta come? This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas. I'm going up to the institute. Jesus. What are you doin? That's just what I wanna find out. You got a quiet phone somewhere? Are you sure you didn't call? Can't thank you enough, Ross .. Screw Citrine. He can fire me. I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there .. Don't give me that! Not another word ! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said yes . So as far as I was concerned, she's ly- ing . And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because you told me .. I'm sick of this toy town shit . How the hell do I know who ? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick. That's a very stupid question, Ross. No .. You didn't know that .. One hundred fucking per cent ! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?" I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion. Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it. Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ... Sure. She wasn't lying about the van. Just makes to so God damned mad .. I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files? God, it pisses me off, Ross. Car accident. He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank. You looked like you did? I wish he'd tell that to Citrine. All but .. How you doing? You believe me, don't you? I was wrong. We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer Eight ." I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years .. That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me? He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you. They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity. Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head. I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that. What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! .. What do you want it for? I had one puff on a pipe . Why? I haven't got it. Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it .. Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky .. We're going. Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump .. Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something .. Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something? This looks promising .. I think this one could be it? I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building? I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics - - Last seen 5 weeks ago .. O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him. Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?" What do you mean, Ross? What do you mean? A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar .. How'd you do it, old man? I am stopping smoking ... Maybe? Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10. It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 .. It's a method for quitting smoking. I already did. What's his problem? There's nothing in the files? Why so coy about the word "frozen"? What time is it? Not too good in daylight .. O.K. Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda .. Not for me .. Who is who? Yeah, he can go ... Two dogs. He should do the dogs. We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs? I think you're here all day. What about that kid, Ross? So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing? Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed .. No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist." I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look .. Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife. I hope I'm not intruding? I am calm .. I am calm .. I'll sign anything you want. Please . Bring here her .. I want Helena here .. I want Serato .. Why can't I have Serato? No. I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything? That's bullshit, Once. Three or four. Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman? We have a multiple homicide, Sir .. If you're not gonna hear me, Chief .. It's her hand. Her scars. Her dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing. No, Sir. No. He hasn't hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow. Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been. What do you want me to do, Chief? I thought it was Taylor's case? I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut .. Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy? Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair. Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here? It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something? Why did he ask if it was frozen? Maybe he's lying to you? No .. But we have a theory .. I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire .. Is this normal? My pleasure .. Who's Popeye? Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one. Week or two. Musta been on the ker- osene. Stinks like a diesel engine. You haven't . And you got no voice in here, Taylor, so keep it shut . I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life .. He ain't offerin me shit. I know what a "witness" is. You don't know what you done, Taylor. Just walk away from me, Taylor .. Don't you know nothing about this guy? He reads the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried .. So read it! You just hung a target around her neck! Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case! You put it in there. Vehicle references. .. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J .. How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere .. Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with. Yes, Sir. I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is? I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for .. It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is .. I think they're gonna arrest me. You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart .. You do? He doesn't need my help. He don't know that. I didn't. Coz he thinks you're a witness. The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to kill you - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to kill you - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here .. I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand. No .. not now .. She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight. Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now .. It's not possible right now. You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"? You're looking worried again, Helena? Who? Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.? Has he got your aunt's address? You know? How do you know? I have to talk to you, Helena. Which is what? He said that? What else did he say? Really? What did he say? How d'you know what I'm like? I was married to her sister .. She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon .. .. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee .. No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers? He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail. Pray? I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing? Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?" I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that. Was. But I don't like to talk about it. There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me. Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with. No. No. What are you reading? I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out. Of course I would .. I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?" No problem. I'm not in a hurry. No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music .. What color was it? Did Amber have a dog? Lotta scratch-marks on your door? D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog? Me? Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small? Can I see your hands? The elevator wasn't working? John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John? No. You must have some idea about him. What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend? I'm Mr Berlin. Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.? O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K. Who sought the warrant? You got a warrant for this? Why? What are you doing, Travis?You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down. Coz I'm short of men & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - you get .. Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you. And did they? He says, you freaked one of em out? "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" .. Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students? I'm talking, outside the girl? Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute? I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John. We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - and a bill for seventeen dollars for its wig ! I have heard you. You just don't like hearing me . You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, in this country , would put a task force together for a body part .. She's not "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? No . She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John. It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris .. Have you got a print from the hand? Have you got a match on the bullet? Then where's the body ? .. Where's the body, and why's he hidden it ? You're pushing this too hard. It's like you want me to say stop ? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little? I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is right now , that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this .. Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had. Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this. Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body? I don't see that at all .. What is all this Jennifer stuff? How do you know her hair's black? What is that? That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone .. Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it .. Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about .. .. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do .. Interview over, Blattis ...You ain't going in alone? What if we need a back up? Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties .. Bits. It's twenty of three. Where's your watch? Hey .. Now? What exactly you doing, John? I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty .. Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops? Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey .. Don't thank me. Thank Margie. What about Citrine? I dunno what I can do to help you? Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite. Ease off, John .. I'm asking it. Well .. I didn't know that .. You don't really believe this? I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro? You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved? Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been any van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's blind , Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother .. You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril .. You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction. Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For nothing , I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes? If there's a body under the snow, fuck it . Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this .. John, stop it . The case is on its ass, you're closed. C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer .. Stop it. No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking. Why's she blind, Bro? No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day. Did I say he did? I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators .. Did he shut you down? What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes .. That isn't what you said before. For a dead dog ? Listen to me saying what? Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this. How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months? You want me to stop the car? It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs? To throw out of the window. I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash." I need some security. I don't trust you anymore. Then give me that Zippo. Pay me, and I shut up. So am I. But where's my money? Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime. No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll. No, you didn't. What ? She's blind , Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano? Thank Christ we got a witness. Where is everyone? Pig Woman agreed to take a test. No you don't. That's how you think you feel about him. That's how you feel about yourself . You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for you . Because I dislike her too much .. Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present? Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles. Someone bet me a dollar .. I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean stop .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, you can .. You gotta stop smoking .. Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief .. You want my advice? Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none? He thinks you stole his promotion. What exactly you doin there, John? It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case. Watch my lips .. Don't get into it .. Because, don't get into it ... Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall. C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted. You're gonna love it. This is "God's Country," John. What does that mean? How's the new residence? Since when did you drink diet soda? What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is French champagne. A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa .. Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here. The dogs ? What do you think? Oh, shit. Of course. The kid. Travis . Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so get it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at? Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - this is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months. Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide? "Welcome to Eureka." You heard. Look for the knife. Be my guest. What you got? Did you bring it with you? And you got no idea with who? Yeah, I guess I do. A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with? Got a handshake like a partially excited penis. She married some English prick. I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R. Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away. I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea. She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here. Even better. Tonight I'm feeling lucky .. Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat. Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour .. Shut up, King Jay .. Alright, guys. We stop this now . Whass going on here? Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight. Ask him. Whatta you mean, "horrible?" Don't annoy me, Travis. Where do you fit in, Trimble? Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got? He has? .. What's he doing here? I'm already walking. Where is it?I've heard you call him Freddy. He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it .. Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat. If , your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for one out of two fucken seconds , she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago .. Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert. Bullshit. Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what? I may have said some- thing. I don't recall. His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper. Wrong cabinet. What are you looking for? Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John .. No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to stop this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing me , & everyone off. He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There is no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean everyone . You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera .. Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant .. No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.The man from the F.B.I. Yes, Sir. I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy. I been told to take your car in, Sir. The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict? I think I've found a hand. I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir No, Sir. I wonder what would make him do a thing like that? His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body. A derelict. He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K. On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there .. You can drive down there, Sir ..
