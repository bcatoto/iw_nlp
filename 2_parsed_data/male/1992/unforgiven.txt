Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood. Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards. I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.Just wondered. Anybody could be scared. We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers. Maybe he ain't so tough. He didn't say nothin', huh? What'd he say? He's coming ain't he? Building his porch! Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns. Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter. Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing? 'Course he's coming. Ha. He was building his fucking porch. Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree. Nope. I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German... Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...Ah, I see. Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play? Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again. A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe. Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president? Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied... Mmmm pistols. You leave me at the mercy of my enemies. Be careful with those, sonny. Not really... Maybe a couple of Peacemakers... I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them? Books. He's my biographer. WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends." What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck. Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers. Shit and fried eggs.Uh... a little, maybe. No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was... Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'... We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...Innocent of what? If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window? Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way... I fined 'em instead. Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice. No? Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess. Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches. He give 'em names? He tell you where them others is? Don't matter, we don't need no whips. Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna... ...wouldn't let you settle it, huh? Oh yeah. Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day? Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet. I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around. Oh. I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska. Who's your friend? Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it. Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen? Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob. You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went. Those cowboys messin' him up? He admit it? Alive? Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends. I could run off them whores. That much, huh? They really got all that money, them whores? Word must have got all the way to Texas by now. All week? An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne? Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons. Yeah? Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set. Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all. Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me. How do you like her? You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies? You figure nobody'll want to fuck her. Property. No? I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole. I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house. I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children. There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot. I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such. Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so? What's your name? You're spillin' your whiskey, mister. Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols? Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all. What? Huh? Oh. Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles. I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then... No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character. "Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby." Give it to him. Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though. Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds. Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas. Look here, let me show you somethin'. See this here pistol? He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn. Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver. Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end. Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry... Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell. First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of. Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that. Duck, I says. "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." Meaning the duck himself, I guess. Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher. That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death? The... Duck of Death. A book, huh? I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob? Letters? You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. See? You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife... I... I guess not. I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that. Me? No. No, I guess not. Oh. Yeah. Free ones? Advances? Yeah, I guess. There's still a payment, ain't there? That big guy lookin' for me? I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead. Three days? I must be. Oh. How long I been here? Scouting? I didn't mean no offense. I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up. Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ? Some big guy beat the shit out of me. I guess I must look a lot like you, huh? I thought... you was an angel. "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill. I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned. Now step aside. boys. He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend. Well, uh... it ain't loaded. Uh... yeah. Yeah. I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed. Uh, William... uh... Hendershot. Like I said, I... I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns. Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms. Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk. Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid. Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it? An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done? Then... what? What'd Ned say? The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they? They got a sign on him in front of Greely's? A sign on him? Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more. He hanged him? Shot him down? Who killed him? Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned? No he ain't. He went South yesterday. Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before... I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed. Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle. I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle. This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles. I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all. You better get on back, Miss. Lemmee see it. Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it. We all got it comin', Kid. It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have... Take a drink, Kid. Well, that fella today, you shot him alright. Yeah? First one what? Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Just SHOOT! Cover me, Kid, while I mount. Did... you... get... him? Yup. You can shoot him. Yup. He's in there. Yeah, he's in there. It's gonna get riper yet. Shut up, Kid. After a ways. Yeah. Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think. I got him. Better re-load it. Shit! If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there. He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him. He got the boy's horse. Finish him, Ned. Get some sleep, Kid. Well... I don't recollect. What business? Easy, Kid, easy. Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear? Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you? Lookin' at? Huh? He's my partner. He don't go, I don't. Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid! Three ways, I figured. Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe... Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'... I don't never see nobody anyhow. Been gone near three years now. She's passed on, Kid. I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess. I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness. Jesus! What for? About what? Oh. Schofield? You from Schofield? He said that, huh? Maybe I ain't. Yeah, I guess so. You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me... ...for somethin' I done in the old days. Hold on, mister. Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand... William Munny, yeah. I could tell you who was last, mister. I was lucky in the order. I always been lucky killin' folks. Yeah? Huh? Yeah. A writer? What do you write... letters an' such? You sure you ain't armed? You ain't shot. Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear? I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch. Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together. Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit. We got to kill this other one first. Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money. HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT? She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'... I seen her... I seen Claudia too... The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die. I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river. He's a snake, he got... snake eyes. Ned... Is that you, Ned? Ned, I seen... death. Worms was comin' out. His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside. I seen him. You... you remember Eagle Hendershot? Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool. Yeah? No. I know it's rainin', Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha? Not for me. I don't touch it no more. Yeah... you said that last night. Fifty yards ain't bad. Guess we better get along. Shit. Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'. HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY. IS THAT YOU, KID? HEY, KID. HEY. I didn't see nothin' planted. Beats the hell out of me. Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse. Yeah. Sometimes... yeah. I don't miss it all that much. Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that. A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh. Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies. Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more. Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared. Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none. Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness. I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters. Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up. I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her. She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more. She gave me the evil eye. It ain't nothin', don't fret it. She don't like it much, you goin' off with me. Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here. We'll come across him tomorra, I guess. Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle? Two weeks, I guess. Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess. We done stuff before for money, Ned. Eleven. Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first. Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody. Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more. Who said that? What? Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it. Did I what? Well, I come back, didn't I? He say anythin'... The Kid... ? The Kid, yeah... Tom? Three? That ain't bad considerin'. I guess you lost some hogs to the fever. Best we move that pig. What is it, son?I ain't waitin', Bill. I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back. Supposin' he don't go to the ranch? You want the Spencer, Bill? I'm goin' on down to Kansas. Two. Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...? Easy, Bill, easy. Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes? Easy, Bill. Claudia... ain't here, Bill. Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies. Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you? He's dead, Bill. Huh? Uh... yeah. You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys? I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two. What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete... God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'. I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows. I guess we could use some now. Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed. I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back... Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed. Jesus. How far kin you see? Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close. Why would the Kid shoot at us? Kid? The Kid's shootin at us? You're marking us, Bill. You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field? He ain't shootin' our way no more. He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way? He hit you? Some fucker's shootin' at us. Whaddaya do, just use your hand? No. I mean... ...an' get yourself a woman? You know? Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all? You ain't like that no more. Nor Quincy, I guess. You ain't like that no more. You was a... a crazy sonofabitch. Well, she... It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly. Sally? Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm... Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... He musta been movin' right along. Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'. Three ways? This Kid, what's he like? How long you gonna be, Bill? Well, I guess they got it comin'... But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive. Well, we thought we was doin' it for money... What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella? Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans. Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em... How long since you shot a gun at a man? Nine... ten years? We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers. Yeah? Just like that? An' if I spot 'em? You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys? We'll bury him. Maybe. We done that stuff. Depends what he told you. About Bill, you mean? I don't kill nobody without him. We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth... Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window. He ain't as tough as you, Kid. Move the candle closer, I can't see. Plenty of times. How many you killed, Kid? I don't like the question. Yeah. He's blind, for Chri... See that scrub oak yonder? We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards? I'm a damn good shot. See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot. You was right to change your mind, Kid. Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass. Well, you was shootin' every which way an'... I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent. Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'... What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?Thank God. What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect? FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES? The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little. STUPID CUNTS! You told them cowboys you had it. Where'd you get the money, huh? Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two. You could run off them two cowboys. You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas. I didn't hear nothin' till last night. Yup. ...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah. Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks... What's all that wood? Heard you done the roof yourself. Hit your finger, huh? She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore. Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it. Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies. This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital. Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.You're gonna kill him, ain't you? Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill? I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess. You could have it. All of it. You... gonna take... the money? Sure. Sure, Bill. Wha... what f-for? I trust you, Bill. Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'. Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger. H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'... How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true. That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'. First one I ever killed. That was... the first one. Say, Bill... Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute. Was you ever scared in them days? I can't see 'em. Yeah. Is it him? You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself? Tell me right off if you see him. Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money. You still think he's in there? You're gonna lose your share. If you don't... When we gonna double back? They takin' water? He ain't killed. You missed him? You didn't...? What happened, did you hit him? What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on? What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on? Did you kill him? He ain't dead? You didn't get him? You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens. You don't recollect! An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself. Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that. Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened? Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch... Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow? What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know? You're goin' back with him? No. I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three. Wasn't nothin' said about no partner. If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala. Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect. Oh. Huh? Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy... Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece. For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too. Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys. Well, how about it? On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol. I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me. Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear. Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer. I could of... easy. You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over... Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County? Hell, yeah. I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before. I'm more killer than him. I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em! I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet. That ain't what I mean. Well, suppose he does? He's gonna die, ain't he? Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said. All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks. We don't need him. The two of us could do it. Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow. That was your idea, I wanted to... Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an... He didn't even pull his pistol, huh? He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one. His pistol must of jammed. Jesus. You done this before? Five. I killed five of 'em. That counts a Mexican I killed. He come at me with a knife. Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape. How many men you killed? Ain't you gonna answer? Say, Ned... ? I ain't blind, you asshole. Fuck you. More. Far enough. Yeah? Oh, them. Hell, I seen them. You gonna share your half with him? Nothin's bent. I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me. We didn't talk about no other fella. Thought you was followin' me.I guess you didn't kill nobody then. N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'... K-k-kill somebody? No... I meant... All that money... I mean... did you...? Did you... did you... ? Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week... how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was... Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time. The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol... That fella come by... Tom. Three. Hullo, paw. Who's he? Two more hogs got the fever.
