Get a job. Tens! Did what's-his-name give you a hard  time? Yeah. Fucking investment bankers. It's over. Pick up the trash. Are they "faced"? Is it so much work to face them the  same direction? You don't do it, I  got to. It's time -- my time -- We've been through all this. This nineteen-gram shit is a drag. I can't believe Ann's been working  as long as she has -- never busted.  She's something. Sure. You believe that? What you gonna do  after she quits? How long you been  with her? She's out. You should pick up her  trade. You're too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you. Yeah. Tour. Normally this wouldn't matter to  you, but you may get hassled. You read the papers? The Park murder.  All over the Post. Mariah Rangel --  nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch  dead in Turtle Pond coked to the  fucking gills. All of a sudden they're  hot after mid-level dealers. They're  buzzin'. You know her? Jack. You pick up from Jealous? We don't make the laws. Nineteen is  carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him  be stupid. Take over for a while. I'm getting  contact high. The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona.  She's trying to get them to come  here -- or, better, Europe. All mark-up -- the "Big One." That's what she says. New Year's Eve  and out -- no Acid House, no product,  no deliveries. Next year -- strictly Akasha. Cosmetics. That's what Ann's calling  the company now -- Why'd anyone pay to put them up their  nose? I like cosmetics. I need  cosmetics. You should come in with  us. Thai. We haven't had Thai in a while. The night begins. Me too. Remove unsightly hair! Eddie wants now. Now. His place. Top  Lady. God knows what happened to his  shit yesterday. Don't you watch TV? Well if you were the normal stupid  fuck you should be so lucky to be  and had one, you'd know it's supposed  to rain -- Some farmer whacked his numerology  on us. The Farmer's Almanac is based on  numerology. Le Tour! -- finally. What took so  long? How's things? I need a quarter -- you got it? Some friends came over. How much is  that? Fourteen-hundred? Yeah... You don't know what she was like -- You charge $200 for what goes for  ninety on the street -- and you're  not gonna sell? I'll call Ann. I'll tell the fucking cops. Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right.  I didn't mean that. I'm quitting  anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry. Two hundred? ...but -- if there's no God, how can  man conceive of him? The idea of God  presupposes the existence of God.  That's the Ontological Argument.  Anselm. Twelve hundred. Fourteen  hundred -- I'm not sure -- Let me finish. Okay, if the idea of  God is implanted by God -- the sensus  divinitatus, the sense of the divine --  what is the role of human thought?  Not faith, thought... C'mon, Tour, stick around. Yeah. There's only four of us and like  seven of them -- and we're paying  for the dope. See her, over there,  the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? --  she's gonna model for Elite. Shit, dude -- Sir? One hundred thirty-one, let's make  it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small  bills. One percent commission, $130  to you -- add tens or whatever if  you want. Same time? I'm late already. I only come 'cause  I like you. Sure you're not Jewish?  I don't want to see you hurt. Find a  man. You should do something else. Don't mix business with friendship. Shalom. We're too small time. Besides, she  wasn't one of ours -- not directly. Tis is at St. Luke's. He wants  somebody over right away. Second  floor waiting room. He says he needs you to come to St.  Luke's. I'd go but I got the other  thing. Yeah. Tonight? Okay. Paramount Hotel. Just a moment. "Welcome to the Paramount. Your party  is out. If you would like to leave a  message for -- -- please do so after the beep." Paramount Hotel. Just a moment. I'm sorry. Ms. Jost checked out this  morning. She checked out this morning. No. St. Luke's -- Roosevelt Hospital. Just a moment. Who is this calling? Mrs. Jost passed away last night. Just a sec -- yes, Plaza Memorial. You're welcome. What? Yes. Bill Guidone. You think you're invisible, don't  you? You think we don't know you,  LeTour -- that's the name you use,  right? You? Who the fuck cares about you? I  could grind you right here! -- maybe  I will! -- and nobody would give a  fuck! You're not worth the paperwork.  I look like Narcotics? I'm Homicide --  I'm investigating the Park murder. Downtown's interested how a Barnard  honors student with fancy parents  got a quarter of uncut coke on her  when she was murdered. I mean, we  just don't see this girl cruising  Alphabet City trying to score.  Somebody sold her, somebody upscale  and classy -- you're classy, I hear --  and that somebody knows something we  need to know. Delivery boy! Let me put it this way. Here's my  card Ask around, take a week or so. Call  me. Tell me something I don't know.  Either that, leave town, or get your  ass busted day in, day out. I told Ann you'd be on time. Tis  called. He said before ten. He said  you were right. Remember the time that cop called  here? Wanted to know if we had "nose  candy"? Ann says, "John Candy?" "John Candy?" Jack. I got a friend -- a D.D. -- got into  lapidary. I'll introduce you. You  have to pass a test. Gems, you know, crystals, diamonds. Stay away. "Ann, this is Ed. You gotta come.  The other thing is over. I'll be  home all night. 749-2876." Shit. I'm sorry if -- We're going Chinese tonight, okay? I  mean we're on a roll -- You gotta get permission? Check with  Mama? Huh? No, don't. Please, I'll give you  money, anything. He doesn't  understand. Whose side are you on? I shoulda never called. No. Who saw it? What happened? EMS is on the way. Where to? Where to, sir? Where are we going? You want me to wait here? Yes. Ninth Precinct. Hold on. Guidone. Laundromat. Your father's got  connections. I thought you'd call. Go on. The jumper. Druggie. Who? You there? Who is it? Where have you been? We were worried. It's hideous. I did it years ago.  I've got to throw everything out.  You haven't been here? Oh, Jack, this is Tony. I told you  about him. You should talk. He's the  lapidopterist -- gems. Lapidarian. Same thing. Sure. They go way back -- before me. Did  you cross him? Don't. He's Ann's Ecstasy connection.  She needs that score. What happened? Don't mess with him. Everybody's dangerous. We heard what  you did to Eddie. Ann thought it was  great. She was afraid that was why  you didn't come back. About what? Tis who? Ann says you want a chart  done. What's wrong? You down? What? Compared to what? My thinking this  or that is going to make any  difference? There's a plan unfolding.  "Will my plane crash?" "Does life  have meaning?" -- why ask me?  Thinking's a fear of living, negative  living; living's something else.  You're afraid. Let the plan unfold.  Stop. Stop, live one day -- one day -- -- day at a time. I'm a drug dealer. Yeah. There's a plastic bottle of bath oil  in the cabinet. Yellow. Use it --  tell me what you think. It's a new  formula. Reggae night. How'd you get in? You buying? How much? Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy? When? How much you spend? He's got a 64 Smith-son. Detective  Special. Nobody wants 'em. Fresh  from a cop. Four -- including me. Street price. Sigame. The hundreds -- Franklins. Automatic. Simple. You put the bullets in -- you point it at the bad guys, pull  the trigger and they fall down! Vaya con Dios. "Too Complicated To Explain." Look at this. We had a graphic artist make it up --  you know, Billy, Five Towns. Tis called twice. He wants you to  come by. He said you. He is -- No, Missy. Stop it. You're breaking my heart. Hold it! Stop right there.
