Sit down! You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck! Yes you are. It's all a big game isn't it? A sick, fuckin' game. I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out. Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place. It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish. You're a lying bastard! You sure you weren't over on Pine Road? We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there. Homesearchers. Then what's he talking about? There's a photostat of the original on the wall. You got it on the board. Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker. I used to. With my old man. He taught me how to hunt and trap. Trapping's a lot harder than most people think. We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields. When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed. But they're crafty little devils. You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent. You ever smell Raccoon scent? Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy. He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it. You know why? Cause he can't help himself. The scent drives him. So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap. You ever do any hunting, Peter? Of course it was. Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering. That's a felony. The door was open. That's right. I guess only the killer would know that. You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it. You think I'm right? You don't tell us how to run our investigation. You got that? We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor. What in the hell do you think you're doing? Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace. Are you crazy? What? All you gotta do is look at the map. What do you mean, no? Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random. Oh, we'll be back. You can bet on it. You like to play games, don't you, Peter? It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent. You are! I don't like you. Casual? You were boning her weren't you? I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem. We seem to have a little problem here? By yourself? I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly? I gotta friend over there. He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records. You know, give him something to do. You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway. I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer. Ready for round two? What is it? I spoke to Jeremy. He's watching Sanderson's kid. Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since. I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel. You alright? How is she? We've checked. There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island. Yeah, I am. I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else? The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy. I think he's a first- timer. Sorry. No shit! I'm sorry, this is just too convenient. We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games. You think he's dirty? What do you think? No. She just moved here last month from Portland. Debi Rutlege. Female. Caucasian. Twenty four. Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel. Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank. We'll find the evidence. Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective. You can't possibly be unbiased. Oh, c'mon. We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we? It doesn't mean anything. It's Sanderson! Don't fuck with us! Where did you go! But a hundred men could move him. What was suspicious about him? Did anyone look suspicious? Think! Did anyone stand out? I don't know. Maybe there's two of them. Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls. Why does he call Sanderson? You should be an actor, Frank. You looked like you were really mad. The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her? Very good. How did you know? I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter. Don't beg, Peter. She has to die. I can't win unless she dies. You're groping. I have been fair. It's my move now. No. As usual you're wrong. It is her I want. Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat. The game's over. You lost. She's in the other room. I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now. Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. It's check, Peter. No you haven't. And even if you had it doesn't matter. Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call. By that time the game will be over. Emotional? I expected more from you. Hello, Peter. --you're hopeless! You can't even read a sentence! Didn't they teach you punctuation in school? The game ends tonight! Interesting concept. I hadn't thought of that. If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it. The police haven't told you? I used a variation. You should have anticipated that. Have you figured out the message? Very good. Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? Have you figured out what I'm doing? Very nice speech, Peter. Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu? There's an old wooden bench in the garden. Next to it is a rock. You'll find a message for you under it. Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are. The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time. What makes you think I was there? What? I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. Not that you're playing it very well. Have you any idea what the message is? So is mine, within the framework of my rules. I couldn't say it any better than Huxley. Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game. Pain? Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have. Just for that no hint today. I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say. You're not playing very well. There are clues all around you and you keep missing them. I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me. I find it irritating, not to mention insulting. I know what I said! She looks just like... Because she's the type. Not really. Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter? I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight. "Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town. Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown. Crawling through the window. At the end of Miss Emma's street. Her God has gone and left his home. So her and I can meet." I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter? You'll find her. I did another one last night. You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play. You don't want to think and that's why I'll win! I'm already two points ahead. That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions. We all have paths to follow. You hope yours will lead you to me. No, only the path she chose to travel. To get your attention. Very amateurish, Peter. I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic. I'm not an idiot! Don't treat me as one! I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you! Are you ready to play? Hello, Peter. Someone who's going to become an important part of your life. I want to play a game with you. Hello, Peter.Don't you see? I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing. I sat with them all. I held their hands. I stroked their hair. I was with them to the end. I took away the blood. I washed them. Their crossing was peaceful. They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother... There was so much blood... It covered everything. You don't understand. The scars on your chest. From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen. You still haven't figured it out, have you? You think that I've put you through an ordeal. My scars run so much deeper than yours. New York. 1986. Viktor Yurilivich. 1985. Hans Korshaud. There's three. The first is 1983. Lionel Baines. The Boston... Now what? Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games. Nope. Nothing. No problem. We're in. Sure. We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York. Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter. I hope you don't mind. Naw, it's all fixed. I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.You're losing me. He was watching you. Why did he what? You're safe. He wouldn't come here. Kathy, please. You're going to wear a hole in the carpet. You don't want to believe it. It's a normal reaction. Feeling better? It worked out alright, didn't it? They asked who would be best suited for this and you-- I admit I handled it badly. Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive-- The police came to me for help. What could I do? Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests. You might not have done it had you known.I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him. Let him sweat for a little while. It's a voice modulator. Find him! I want to talk to him. Sanderson? I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich? She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it. Maybe he's going to drug her? You still having a problem with this? Check with the State. If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it. Nolan? Anything? Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal? Take it easy. Both of you. What was your relationship with her? I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying. He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi. Local? Run it down. That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message. How long she been dead? Same as the others? That's great. There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island. We'll check that out. What about the blood? You mean, no prints but hers? What about prints? Anything? There's no blood. Where's the fuckin' blood? Any sign of rape? How long has she been dead? Whaddaya got, Nolan? Okay. Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later. I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with tonight? Did you see his face? The most logical choice. We're going to work on the message. We can't rely on your judgement anymore. He's right, Kathy. What time did he get there? Yes. Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure? That's a big area to cover. It can't be a coincidence. The woman that owns it has a son. She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days. We're trying to locate him. There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week. We're checking that out too. Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have. All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night. They're all the same type. All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers. What did he mean by Huxley? You never know how you're going to catch a suspect. This ain't no photo. Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty. Call dispatch. Double the patrols. I want that area blanketed. I don't think it matters. Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center. I was thinking the same thing. He must be local. It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name. What about this? Anything else? What about the way he arranged the body? Kathy? It could have been a tape. A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself. No. I told him to. I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end. And this Jeremy-- It's important. We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation. We're not sure. What did Dr. Fulton tell you? You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy? Well? Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also? Do you know how she found the apartment? Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in. How long ago was that? If you can think of anything else give us a call. It's over, Peter. Let's stop the games. I'm not sending a car. Alright, c'mon Peter. We're moving you to a cell. I understand that this is just another one of your games. Maybe he just got tired of covering for you. Answer the question. Where were you last night? Wait a minute. There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms. He uses castles...plural -- then says "can't move me." Singular. Not can't move us. A building? It's a commercial area. No one lives there. I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you. There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board. How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him. It doesn't make sense. "Is". Did you tell him about the institute? We think he might be making a reference to drugs? Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine. Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories. "Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street." We think he might be making a reference to himself. That's alright. We'll take it from here. Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard. She's a psychologist helping us out. Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier? What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing. Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number. This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room. Here's one at 9:04 pm. It says: From Debi. Please call me at home. I know. You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five. Where did you go after that? Could you tell me where you were last night? I know you're busy so I'll get right to it. Did you know her?Feel like practicing? She went into town with Mrs. Lutz. Did they get him? Exactly... and you did this. What do you see here? Whatever's on your mind. Just thought you might want to talk. You're always in the middle of a match. Peter... Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it. You don't win by playing it safe, Peter. On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique. He knows you're aware of that.I'd say at least eighteen hours. Yeah. Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you? This is where he forced his way in. We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope. Not a drop. Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross. He tapes their mouths shut. We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths. We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store. No Frank. No prints. No prints. Not much. I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath. Bingo. Not that I can see. We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle. Six, eight hours tops. Not much. There's no sign of a break in. I think she let him in.The message! I figured out-- What? Get off me! Fuck you! I'm tired of your goddam accusations! If you want to arrest me go ahead! Otherwise back off. I'm positive. I was at the beach. Then let's narrow it down. If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we? He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it. He's not talking about himself. No, I need the original note. What if he doesn't bite? What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon? No. What do you want? No it wasn't. How'd you get in here? I wouldn't know. You don't have an investigation without me. You got that? Maybe you should. You think you're going to catch him on a trace? Everything he does is planned out well in advance. The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up. Let's see how much he wants to play. Not what -- who. Morpheus. The Greek God of dreams. Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home." Morpheus. His victims aren't random. It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it. He says it's a game. All games have a strategy. No. He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven. Why not come back then and listen for yourself. That's crazy! Why would I draw attention to myself like that? What's that supposed to mean? Fine, don't ask me out on a date. It wasn't serious. What's your problem? Casual. What are you saying? What kind of problem? Yes. Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes. People have a lot of free time. They like to gossip. You told me. When you called you said she was in the other room. Drop the knife. The pipes. I know where you are. No! Wait!! I'll give you anything you want. Anything! Please! That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley? "His play is always fair and just." It's me you want. Not her. Please... wait. Let me speak to my daughter. Yes? I've figured out the message. If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent. You sonofabitch! I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything. Remember eventually revenge- - They think that you and I are doing this together. What word did you leave last night? You're next move should have been e2- e3. You're playing the Tarakoss opening. Hello. It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know. Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall! I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. You heard me. Why did you go out to the institute looking for her? You like to brag, don't you? If it's so important, why don't you just tell me? Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just." How? And you want these girls to feel your pain? Why are you doing this? You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people. Then call them! I'm just trying to play the game. Just like who? But you said you didn't know her. Why her? You know her? Hello? You're not going to tell me that. If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it! Where is she? What? Why not? Why did you write remember on the wall? And -- what path is that? Did you know her? Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege? Just a second. Hello? I haven't got time for this. Who is this? What scars? Computers. That's how you got into Homesearchers records. You can get into anything. But why? Why? What is it? He's in his seventies and lives in Holland. Never mind. He died two years ago. Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me. There can't be more than a handful. D2-d4... b1-c3... and c1-f4. It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening. David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years. Set up some pieces on the big board? Okay. Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island. Can we correlate data? Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that? Of course not. What's this? Thanks. It isn't Kathy. I'm sorry, honey, I can't. Not today. For what? Don't you have something you want to say to David? Nothing. Has he gotten through to any? Who told you that? You want to sleep in my bed tonight? I see. You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you? What are you doing up? My cheering section. Did you send the car? I signed the confession. What about the car? Look, I'll do anything you want! I'll sign anything you want! Just send a car out to the hotel. Don't you understand what I'm telling you? That's why he wants me out of the way. This is insane! Can't you see what's going on. The killer wants me out of the way. He's setting me up. Jeremy would have never killed himself. I went out. Are we going to go through this again? That's got to be it. A shadow. What's as big a castle? As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it? The shadow of the castle. Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building? He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it. A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved? As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me. It's posed as a question. What am I? But he had to dump the body there to make the move. That's all he needs. He's making the moves. It's an opening. I just can't remember the name. Okay, it's a game. He's starting it, so he moves first. He's white. e2-e4. Maybe I already have. He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!! As large as castles. You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me. Another one? What word did he leave? Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill? That's it? Maybe, but I don't think so. I think it's just a tease. What have you come up with on the riddle? You want me to go with you? Maybe I can help. We've already met. Haven't we... Doctor. I don't know. I was afraid there'd be hours of questions. I can't afford to miss a game. I got it from the tournament directory. She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow. To my room and then I went for a walk. Here. I played Gregory Lutz. Only in passing. To say hello to. Yeah. Just let me grab a shower. No. Mate in five. Who says something's on my mind. About what? You have something you want to say? I want to be the best I can. I've got be here for the police when they come. Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now. Is it serious? We got a problem? It's a good play, but risky. I suppose you have something in mind? Then I'll transpose. You opened with the English. Lutz won't use it. He opened his first game with it. Do we have a future? It's over now. I got lucky. Are you going to come tonight? This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it? You're right. The killer told me. Frank told me. It's got to be grammatically correct. If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be. He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word. Because I know what it says. This letter. I've never opened it. Because she killed herself!! But I do. It's not that easy. You don't understand. I can't think any more, unless it's about you. I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile. Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard? Ever since my wife died I've been... I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them. No, listen. You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now. You really haven't seen my best side. I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could... The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have. I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did. Can I come in? Right. Here! c-4. He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces. All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse. Why? Where's the note? A fierce magazine... brutal... An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine... fierce... Mad. Exactly. It's the key. In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart? How could you think that, Kathy? How could you even consider it? --admit what? That I was right about you in the steam room? That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want? Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room? Then why are you backing up? What's wrong? I thought you said the line was busy? Did you call? If I have to. I'm going to take a shower. You. Fine. Call room service. No. I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved. This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time. I just don't want to fight with you. What are you talking about? You don't even know me. What? By attacking me? What is this? I'm not playing a game now. What? It was. It's alright. It was a long time ago. She died in a car accident. Alright. What about me? Wasn't I just talking about me? You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to. No. But I'm open to distractions. Why? Doesn't that scare you? I know you didn't I know it was bad. Relax. You're not? Why? I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone? Let me ask you something? Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not? Very good. Spoken like a true psychologist. When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations. What is that Masters and Johnson? Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there? You mean like in the steam room? I'm just curious. Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Are you married? Do you? What about you? Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry? Take your average cop. They deal with death everyday. If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement. Oh, but it is. He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him. That's a game. It has rules and objectives. In a way. I think it's interesting. It wasn't intentional. It's going to be a long night. It could take hours before we know something. You should try to eat. You sure you don't want to eat something? She could be dead now. I can't right now. I've got a game. I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down. Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet? No you didn't. What are you looking for? Getting too hot in here for you? Each circumstance requires a different tactic. Are we talking about me, or chess? It is. I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation. I see. This is going to be a very polite conversation. What shall we discuss? The weather? Movies? If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion? Chess is a reflection of life. Life is violent. The strong win. The weak perish. Not really. You see your goal and you go after it. Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed. When I was very young. Yes. Uh huh. No. I don't. How come you don't stay with them? Yes. Sorry. I thought it was empty. Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win. You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous? I'm sure you are.
