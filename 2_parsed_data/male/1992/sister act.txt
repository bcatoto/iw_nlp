I must tell the Cardinal. I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive. I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again. Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them. I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended. Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.SING! SING! SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR! SING! Yes, Mary? LET THY SPIRIT LET THY SPIRIT LET THY SOUL BE HEALED LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH LET THY SOUL BE HEALED LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDEDI said I was a nun, not an asshole. Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something? You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention? Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell. Well... yes. Yes it is. Really. YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE And I'm tearful! But I'm fearful! Were you tempted? HE'S SO FINE... He's... dreamy. He's... I think they hear you! You know what we're saying! You know, I just might! I think I hear it! But how? What you say? You know it. How are you doing. Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun. Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I do. And you listen to that? Probation? Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here? At Sunday School? Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..." Thou shalt not. So, hi there. I'm... Sister Mary Clarence. And you're... young Christians. I guess I should assign you this passage. What's good? What were you talking about? What? You can handle this. Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience? His ashes? Then stop trying to memorize it. Hit the road. What do you want? This is a private area! Get lost! That used to be true, Vince. I was with you. But something happened. And I'm different now. Real--different. I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience. And I've got just two words for you. And those two words are... Right here. Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this. I feel sorry for you, Vincent. And I forgive you. I am sorry for all my sins. And yours. Good evening, Vincent. Right. Yeah. Forgotten. Sure. Thanks. A lot. No... it's fine. You lying sleazeball! The best years of my life! What am I, garbage? Am I lint? You pig! You bastard! What? You said that? And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her? Did he say we'd be happy? You did what? Today was the deadline, Vince. Vince... Who? The other woman. Your wife. Come on -- stay. Just a little. We can talk, I'll get a pizza. Pizza in bed, we'll have fun. And you still haven't told me what happened. What did she say? WISH HE WAS MINE. THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR. HE'S SO FINE. He's so dreamy. He's like... a Greek god. He's the cutest guy here. He's boss. He's fab. He's... Look at that. Get a gander. Oh my! This prom is a real drag. Oh, girls. Were you wicked? Pay attention... What a shame! It's true -- I know her. Get moving. I'm right behind you. Jackpot! Two buckets That man -- who is he? And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse. And so you truly need our prayers. Because we're So use it. When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration. Most music is. So don't hold back. Let all that joy go right into your voice. Make me happy. Let me hear it. Perk out. Perk down. Hold it. Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you? Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups? It's a rhythm section. The beat. That machine. No way. We're a choir, right? Headliners. The big room. Two days a week won't cut it. Every day. The goods. The sound. The sale. Let's rearrange a few things. Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto. Get over here. Mary Robert --with the sopranos. You see? We've got the voices. They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me. We just need charts -- harmony -- chops. Hold on. Is this... choir practice? I love my heddles. Show me again. Just about. Show me again. Oh, right. At my old place, we used to... wash cars. Groom dogs. So... nice loom. But don't you get money? From the Vatican? Why? Not in years. No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING Where did that come from? Right. Sing! Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White? You know? About me? About everything? That's true, wouldn't that be great. Of course, we never know when things are going to change. Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow. Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular. I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up. What? Babies Hopeless I Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting. Make it look easy. Again! It'll be hell. A bunch of real mama's girls. I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you think? They're pretty raw. I hear you. How many days a week do you rehearse? Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline. Hard work. Yeah, for one second. That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other. Be a group. Mary Robert. What? Sure. Kind of... free-lance. Um, I don't really know this one... Whatever. You know that song? Like this place? What? Which convent? It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight. In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass. Frank. Dean. Sammy. Right at ringside. What did He say? Don't you know it! It's true! Bless you. She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go. Run! Take off! They're from my old convent. Right to Hell. Just kidding. Where is that bus? Oh no. We'll always be together. It's contraband. Don't ask. But I wanted to give you a treat. A sort of... thank-you gift. Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house. WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART Give me a C. A C! Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out. Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night... I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler. Experience! Goddamn it! Keep moving! Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. I mean, nothing really happened. We just... took a walk. Honey. Good point. Especially that dude you were with. I'd like to see him down front. You watch yourself! This is your neighborhood. Your turf. You should get to know 'em. Initiation. You understand. Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head. Right. Bobs It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program. How old are you? You shouldn't be smoking. Have you ever seen a diseased lung? Hand 'em over. Now you. We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place. We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert. Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent. Wait. Well, then there's only one thing to do. She said that? Reverend Mother? She won't? Why not? Excuse me? Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you? Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents? We can call the Enquirer. Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows? Three years. A rookie. So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's? Right. Okay. Bob. Nice to know you. Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce? Sister Doug? A cigarette? What? What? What does she want now? I did the dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why can't people share? Five a.m.? What? What time is it? Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late? What about me, Reverend Mother? I think you were right. I'm just a bad influence. Sister show biz. I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham? Then I guess you're stuck. Life sentence. No parole. You saved my life. Reverend Mother -- Thank-you. What are you doing here? But... Okay, so I just got things started. But you could build on that. You could keep it going. But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it! But -- there's so much more to do right here. And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone. But -- why? What? Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving. In just a couple of days. You sent for me? But... wait a minute... A vote? Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals? What do you mean? Please let me try. I'm begging you. Hold on. That's not fair. I worked hard with them. They gave up their free time, and they loved it. Those women are happy. And we can get even better. We can wake this place up. Exactly. People like going to theaters and casinos. But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint. I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in those seats. Not the choir, please, anything but that. The choir -- I mean, have you heard them? I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I No. No. What? I am? But you can't kick me out! Guys want to kill me! You're a nun! A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep? I mean, I'm a major sinner! All-time great! Hall of Fame! Aren't I, like, your dream come true? Your Olympic event? A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A janitor? I know! I'm sorry I didn't mean for it to happen! And I was the one they were shooting at! Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen! So... hi there. Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star! I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver! Really catching on. In English? It never solves anything. Sometimes it's not enough! Have you been out in those streets? Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them! Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough. I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age. I wish somebody would talk to me about it now. Deal with it, sweet thing. It's important, nowadays. You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana. I got it. Yeah? What's wrong with my life? Wait. No. You're kidding. Lights out? At nine? My day's just starting. Right. So what do we do now? Ping- Pong? Row over to the monastery? Oh, I don't know... Satan? It's like the Stone Age. The room time forgot. What about a phone? Right, sure thing. But what about, like, appliances? Like a little color portable? Boom box? You were right the first time. Is this like, solitary? The cooler? Where's the furniture? My what? That's tomorrow! Don't you have any snacks? Machines? Is this all the food I get? No food? A what? Silence? No talking? All day? A what? I'm outta here. Like to who? No problem. Mary Clarence? Like a guy? Like a dumb guy? But look at rites Look at this! I'm a nun! I'm invisible! I'm a penguin! No! No! I can't do this! Can do. How about a robe? One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket. "Guest of St. Katherine's" Deal. Cool. Is there a menu? Or buffet? Fine. Got it. Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right? I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice. So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me. I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low. So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb. Capisce? What's a concubine? You mean black people? Are you talking about me? What? What? What? You see? You see? I have to get out of here I have to make a phone call. Don't you get it? I'm in a convent! You're a nun! Beats me! What do you think? Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone. And wearing a black bra, under my uniform. The demon bra. I was expelled! When I was fifteen? Parochial school. Akron. St. Android's. Oh my God. This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening. It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's! That's my real name! Currently I'm a singer. Sort of. Christy. Christy Van Cartier. Mother Theresa. Gandhi. Don't you understand? This is all a mistake. I'm the good guy. I'm the witness. And I'm being punished! A convent? They put me in a convent? What's the problem? Wasn't there any more room in Hell? Yeah, like what? Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun? That depends. Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news. I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true. Even nuns have to pee. You don't get it! It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time. They're singing for the Cardinals. It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this. That's not the point! They need me! Eddie -- I've got to go back. They won't sing without me. I'm deserting them. I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral. We're singing for the Cardinals. I can't go with you. How? I know, I know. I'll be careful. I'll try. I've got to go. I have? You're not... seeing anybody? Well.. thanks. I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes. I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here. I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun. You mean -- worried about my testimony? Really? Lieutenant? I am? I know that. This isn't about me. It's about the choir. You should hear them. They're good. Really good. And I taught them. I really can't talk about it now. The place is packed. SRO. I've got a show to do. It wasn't my fault! They just showed up. It's helping the convent. Eddie! You scared the hell out of me! So what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Does she know people are trying to kill me out there? What'd she say? Do you hear that? That choir? Eddie, in here, that's what they call music! But it's a nightmare! Mother Superior is out to get me! She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture! You son-of-a-bitch! Like what? But I'm going insane! All these people do is pray and work, work and pray! I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food! Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet? Get me outta her! Eddie, you've got to get me out of here. I can't stay here! I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do? But Vince has contacts all over the place! This is San Francisco! They'll be looking for me! With nuns? With rulers? No way. I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince. Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here. Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em. I hate you. I totally hate you. What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me? Okay -- no limo. Okay, here's what I want. I know about this stuff. A five-star hotel. With room service. All right! I get the picture! I'll do it! I'll testify! Ten flights? And if I don't? Screw you! I don't know anything about bodies! I mean, he didn't bring it home. He was good to me... sometimes. He was sweet. He took care of me. Who am I supposed to go out with? He owns a casino. He let me sing. I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me! They tried to kill me! I'm not kidding! Right between the eyes! Down and out! The guy was gone! I... I couldn't believe it! Think again! And get out of here. When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant? What do you want -- cheap thrills? He's a businessman. 'Cause you're always out, arresting people. Making trouble. I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing! I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard! Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron? At least he's not a cop. At least he can afford a decent gift. But -- wait. People throw stones. They call me names. I mean, really. Jerusalem is a real drag. Everybody hates me. Hey, girls.I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure. Don't you have a concert to go to? What're you doing? Nuns? They need you? A bunch of nuns? For what? Moral guidance? Make-up tips? I think they'd understand. You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here! What? Long story. His goons will be here any minute. We've got to get you out of here '- now! Vince knows you're here. Just remember - you're a target. Don't you think Vince has a T.V.? You re sort of... radiant. your eyes are shining. You're rea1ly different... No. Most of the time I'm thinking about you. And now... you've really changed. Me too. No -- worried about you. Personally. I've been worried about you. Yeah. You look... great. I mean it.. Jesus, look at you You're glowing. Listen to yourself. This isn't a career opportunity. You're supposed to be hiding out! What if I was Vince? You'd be dead right now. What are you doing giving interviews on TV? Go in and talk to her. It can't hurt. Go. She's counting on it. She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival. You blew it -- big time. She doesn't want you back. Don't call again. It's not safe. I'll be in touch. I just need a few more weeks, Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead. Calm down. Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately. Not again. You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are. Pray. Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent. Nobody knows you're here but me. We're trying to get a quick court date. A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can. And one bullet. That's all it's gonna take. It's a convent. All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along. Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here? I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you. No nothing. Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune? Let me spell it out for you. You have to hide like you don't even exist. You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight. Maybe Hawaii. Get a stenographer. You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street. Then-you run. He didn't do you a favor. You couldn't believe it? Vince the Prince? Information, baby. I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience. A what? When are you qonna wake up? Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then. I told people you were a hooker! So I don't shop. I used to buy.you,..stuff. On your birthday . When we were seeing each other. From Vince? What a guy. Doo-lang, doo- lang. I wouldn't even tell the Pope. Where's who? Jesus. Data-base hoods. It's a wonderful world. Beloved daughter missing. Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so. Dead or alive. Then one day they find you. We could put you into our witness protection program.That... thing. That nun thing. Take it off. Okay, Christy -- strip. What? Yeah, right to the cops. No way. With love. You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen. A nun? We didn't tell you what? We're the guys from Vegas. You had Christy last night, but you let her get away. It's upsetting. I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him. We're looking for Mike. But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun. Where is she? I can't see anything in here! Which one? Which one! Maybe pants. Right. It didn't work, Vince. Yeah... But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent? Not... totally. It's a bluff, Vince. And if she runs? Vince -- is she... okay? She's praying. And then we can ice her. No nun, no evil eye. For like, twelve zillion eternities? I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to. You didn't shoot! No smart-ass remarks or nothing. She's gettin' away! So that guy in the bar was right? She's like... some kind of nun?I'm telling you! That she's a nun! That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun! But you didn't tell me! Who are you guys? You found him -- but we're not open yet.You won't even tell us? Vince is getting desperate. Where is she, Eddie? Where'd you stash her? They open a window. A hiding place.I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp! Joey -- do it. She's afraid. Come on, tell the boys you're afraid. What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you. What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you? Babe, what happened here? Look at you. And to say you're sorry. About this afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you understand? Forgotten. Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me? Yes? Babe, it's not me! I love you! It's God! We can still see each other. Just like always. It's a different kind of sin. Smaller. You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I'm nuts? He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell. For all eternity. For the first time in I don't know how long. I wanted everything done right. Open and above board. I told Father Antonelli I was in love. I told him it was a special love, for all the ages. I want us to be together. Like people. Honest, decent people. In the eyes of God. Babe, today... I went to confession. How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank? You are so damn sexy. What did who say? She's a broad! Got it! Just some broad! Joey? Willy -- hit the lights. There she is! Get her! I'm telling you, she's not a nun! Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes. So, take it off. You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot. Well? I can't believe this. Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time. It didn't happen. What's the problem? It's done? You know so much. They've got Christy, and we've got to find her. Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge. Fax it to every contact we got. He's so damn cocky. This is different. Take care of it. Maybe. Find 'em! Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right? Are you nuts? She's not a nun. It's Christy. She's a babe! And who are you to talk? You were nothing. You couldn't even sing. I must have been out of my mind. I love you, Chris. I always will. I gave you so much. My time. My affection. A big-time career. And how do you repay me? What's the thanks I get? Where's the loyalty, huh? Where's the love? Can you hold? Can you try? Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely? She did. Bring her back. Now. For a talk.What's she doing? A sweater. Strip down a nun? You want us to fry? That's what I figured, too. Neither did you! She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car. Forget her! We got the one we need! Step on it! Yeah, right -- when I see it. Where? We both missed. She's... she's a nun. She's acting weird, Vince. Ever since we picked her up. She's a nun, Vince. It's that call you were expecting, Vince. I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
