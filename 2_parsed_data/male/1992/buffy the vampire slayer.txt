Let's move out! Whoa! Whoa! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now. Coach knows what abs are? ... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow. You going? Litter, yeah! I like it. Can I be your friend? Buffy, this is crazy. What do these guys want? Buffy! Looking tasty. Absolutely. I see now the error of my mistake. Man has a complex. Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?I'm hungry. Let me in, Pike! I'm hungry! The sun! It burns! It burns! I... feel.... pretty. I'm fine. Invite me in, Pike. Let me in. Utterly. Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know. Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches. When you get your car together, man, let's bail. I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you. Yes. Definitely. Definitely. Please, God. They're all the same! They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human. I hate them. Rich bitches. They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped. Hey! She wasted my dog! You're the guys from the movie! Figures. Amazing! That's it, man. That's the whole story. Oh, yeah. But I still want to know what happens. Suck!Down there. My bike! She's a lesbian, too. She told me. Yeah, I saw her. Bitch took my wheels. You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?Yes! Nice to feel needed. What's with you? I don't know. Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.' Well, um... litter? Stay away from my thang. Sorry, honey. 'Thing.' I'm out of here. Jenny. You weren't home. Like always. Didn't you get my message? Oh, come on, Buffy. You know what's going on. It's not working out at all. I've got to move on. I mean, I've got needs, too. I told you about all this. I'm here with Jenny. Buffy, what are you doing here? So that's your tutor, huh? What is he, like, your boyfriend now? So I noticed. I can't get sick. You know -- training and all. I'm gonna be late. Where were you last night? I called your house like four times. Hey, baby, how ya doing? You look beat. Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight? Hey there. Come on, what was it? What'd you dream about? You were having a nightmare. I just want to see the basketball scores. It's important. It's the news, Buffy. Hey, it works for me. If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable... Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh. You okay? I heard she got straight A's. Okay, let's go. Well, I'm done. Are you done? Buffy? Oh, baby! Write that down.You are much more. But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers. Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called. Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan. He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth. They are a plague upon us. The mark of the Coven. She has died. You are the next to be called. Why do you think you were sent to me? Trained as you were? You bear the mark. You know you must. There is only one. Now you are that one. It is time.Which way did she go? Wheels? Yes. Did you see a girl come by here? Wait! None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble. Football is my life. Oh, I'll be there all right. I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready. All right. Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it. Your fate. Another distraction. It's not right. There isn't time. Interesting. I want to die. My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable. But it's in the back. Why are we wasting time with this, anyway? I can't work this. Vampires of the world, beware. As for example, what? Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend. It interferes with the work, and it... It isn't important. There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge... ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born. My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs. There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies. I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger... I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this. It's what I was raised to do. There aren't many of us left, the Watchers. Not if you're careful. Five. What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer? Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers? Five. Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart. Do you want to live? Do you? What do you want? Encouragement? 'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.' Buffy... Don't start with me again. A what? You'll get used to it. I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes. It's natural. A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it. It's part of how you are able to track them. You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps. And the alley was a mistake. Never corner yourself like that. If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now. One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten. He was slow. Very simple. They won't all be that easy. Try to pay attention. Same one. All right. You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps? Or Jack the Ripper? Good Lord. What do you study in history? Oh, several. Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar? No. No bats, no flying. They... float, occasionally. Not really flying. Your turn. Exactly. You're changing. You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful. Two days ago, would you have even hit me? Let alone so powerfully? Don't you see what's happening? You're changing. You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of. God, this hurts. I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working. I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process. I don't think you understand the full implications of -- It was necessary. And you caught it! Only the chosen one could have done that. I had to test you. Oh. Good. Oh. I thought... you lead me -- Who we gonna beat? Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer. All right. Why don't you show me a cheer? Cheerleading. For... sporting events, yes? But you enjoyed it, yes? Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped. Why? I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you. What your strengths are, your likes... Everything. What's your best subject? We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out. For your parents. In a way, yes. Your fate is inexorably connected to them. We'll cover it later. Yes. They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork. The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own. You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated. Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy. But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention. Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos. Do you know what a Vampire-King is? There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start There's so little time. It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes. It's true. Skip it. Meet me at this address after school. Go to school tomorrow. Try to act normal. Don't let anyone know what's happening. This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore. Where's the other one? We wait for Robert to wake up. Just for protection. You won't have to do anything. I just need you to watch. This is it. Cramps? Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams? I have to show you. Lothos. China. In Virginia. In the past. A girl. Maybe... A Magyar peasant. An Indian princess. A slave. Did you ever dream that you were someone else? I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof. You bear the mark. Yes. To stop the killing. To stop the vampires. You must believe me. You must come with me while there's still time. You don't understand. You have been chosen. Wait! You must come with me. It's much too late already. You must come with me to the graveyard. To bring you... your birthright. I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy. Not at all. My name is Merrick. I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were... complications. You should have been taught, prepared. I'm looking for you, actually. I'm sorry. That was impressive. The... tumbling.I mean it. Get away from here. No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty. Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something. You look like shit, Benny. Wait a minute. What's wrong with you, man? Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt -- Benny, man, where you been? You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix! Our own world, where we could live and grow beans. Hundreds of beans. You think? Split? Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me. Well, there it is, isn't it? You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them. What's that all about? Would you sleep with them? You didn't like them. Bummer metaphor. We hate you guys! Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?' I'm just wondering. It's coffee. We're looking at a dog, possible coffee... Come on, come on, fork up the scub. No, we didn't. Wrong answer! No prize. Booo! You're the boss, boss. I just thought maybe we should wait. Who's afraid? Besides me, I mean. I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off. We could maybe wait till later. Are you okay? Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone. You say that like it's a bad thing. Are you nuts, Buffy? There's a hundred of them out there. They'll rip us apart. Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance? Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time. That's me. I crashed your party. Benny was right. You guys are all exactly the same. I should have known. But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy. Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry... You got that right. I thought you wanted to kill vampires. I don't believe this. The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer? What for? Second word... sound like 'dance'. Come again? Dress, huh? What for? Cool. I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches. What do you need? I been working on some stuff for you. What'cha doing? Who? Buffy? What's wrong? I think I could help. You gonna tell me you don't need help? Besides, Oxnard sucks. I don't know. I kind of thought I ought to be here. You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from. I know. You know, you saved my life. And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost. Hey, Buffy... Oh, I'll be fine. Got my chair, got my window, I'm great. I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything. No, you're not. I know. My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead. I'll back that up. Hey, jeez are you okay? You need a hand? Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard. Thanks. Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus. I'm gone. Yeah, I was bailing. I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess. Bad scene. God! Unbelievable. Vampires. They were vampires, weren't they? Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby? Water. Okay. Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Kind of miss my knees, though. It was. I think it's pretty much ready for the -- Hi there. Yeah, we're drunk. We're the Drunks. What's your name? Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe? Will you guys shut up, please? You want some punch? Hey, wait a minute... I'm sorry. I'm Pike. This is Benny. The don't. You kind of wish they would, though. Run. I am. I don't think so. You should think about leaving, too, man. Sell this place... Something's going on here. I don't know. Something real weird. Hey, have you seen Benny lately? I'm leaving, man. I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.Got that. Could be. Could be. Hi, Grueller.Hey. What should I do if I see Benny? All right. Take care of yourself. Ah, you'll be coming back. No... You want me to give him a message? Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money? What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
