That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in, You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand? No. How could you understand. So what are you doing here? I was gonna bring it back myself. You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again. You took the chalice.I know. Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool. There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right? How are you doing, man? The rich kind. Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide. That stuff'll kill you quick, man.I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you.Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine. OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it? Oh, really? Let me think about it. What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game? All right, cop. I want my money.Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want. You've really got a problem. That 50 G could help you -- The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember? How's the case going? He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it? You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids -- You're a fucking joke, you know that? He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that! This psycho can. Don't bullshit me. Do you have the money? Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac! Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it! Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind? OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do? Are you sure? How about 7 1/2? All right. What are you gonna do?I'm a Catholic. The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to -- I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win! You mean you could use it. A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him. Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man... Nah... Yeah. Those fucking Mob assholes. Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands. It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me. You gotta believe me! Yeah. People. What's to believe? The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way. Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns! She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ. They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would. Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in -- Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man! Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow. Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow. Fuck you. Just give me back a little something for the road. What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you? Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good. Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I -- Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why? Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me! Hate me! Help me! Hate me! Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that. You can't forgive me. After what I've done. I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad. Me? Yeah, sucker. You better be there! Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop! There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing. Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet. It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game. Large? -- that there was never any other way it could have gone. Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what? Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that -- Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet. What case? I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic. Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and -- Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in. Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game. I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone. What money? That's my problem. Just put in my bet. There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out. I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money I wanna go double or nothing on the next game. Yeah. I'm sure. Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money. I want 15 on the Mets. I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.You knew them? Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew? Yes, Sister? I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer. It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt. Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
