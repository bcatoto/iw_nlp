Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne. Yes, I suppose that we did. Ah. "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"? Mr. Wayne ... a reminder: Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck. May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative? I think I'll take the stairs. I will relay the message. Which is why I hoped you'd snub him. I suppose you feel better now, sir. It's vichyssoise, sir. Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?Wrong on both counts. First you're gonna shut up. Then you're gonna turn yourself in. I tried to grab you -- save you -- A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ... We do. ...four, five. I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up. One ... A "he-man"? Sure. They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of. Hanging on every word. I'm -- sorry, I -- "Shreck's." You -- Maybe you're right. Things change. What're you really after? Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good. You're not the Mayor. Admiring your handiwork?Right. Sure. And "Peace on earth, good will toward men." I guess this mean we won. You'll never guess. I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ... "Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ... Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh? Funny, but sort of mysterious... Alright, thanks. 'Fraid I can't. There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but -- Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza. You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show. No, actually I feel worse. Vichyssoise. Supposed to be cold, right? It's cold. No, nothing, ah ... His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them. I don't know. Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing. But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it. Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge or the jury... I mean, just who do you think you are ? Same here. So why'd you come tonight? Y'mean take off our costumes? No hard feelings? Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and -- What're you doing three dates from now? I, ah ... never fool around on the first date. Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion. If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you. Photojournalist. Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because I had trouble reconciling them. Vicki said. Nope, I told her everything. Had one. Didn't work. Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose. ... and me. No, that's be me and me. Is that what I said? ... Maybe I'll watch it on TV. Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean... You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle. You almost sound enthusiastic. I wouldn't be caught dead. No, it's probably how I would be caught. The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait -- And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"? The guy probably prevented millions in property damage. I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck. Selina. Hi. Didn't mean to -- I, ah ... didn't catch your last name. I'm tempted. Well, I could ... free up some time... No. And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him. Didn't I say that? Sorry. I mistook me for somebody else. We've met. It does to me. Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City. What happened? "Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang. I can't prove it but we both know it's true. Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting... I'm not scared of you, Max. Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here. So -- Good time, too. Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'. No. No glass on the inside. Hmm. Primitive ventilation.You buy this "blurry" business? PMS. She jumped. She'd been depressed. Dad! Save yourself!Yawn. I am the light of this city. And I am its mean, twisted soul. Does it really matter who's the "mayor"? Ingenious costume. Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody? Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope? Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back? Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office. If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to -- Scared of Oswald, are you? Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school! Mayors come and go. And heirs tire easily. Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck. If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning. I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time. Weird, huh? Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows -- One way to find out? Was. Selina! Selina Kyle!? You're fired! And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman? Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me. Let's make a deal. Other than my blood, what can I off-- My blood? I ... I gave at the office. I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss. Money, jewels, a very big ball of string... Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage? Bottom line: she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window. Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry. Yeah -- Oswald, please. Yes. Yes . Boyfriend trouble ..? I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out -- Son! I'm the one you want! Penguin, please! Ask yourself: Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you? Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage? Not Chip! Please! Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead. I think you'd feel out of place at my party. You see, it's for winners. Point is, listen to them. They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future. If it works, don't fix it... Imagine: You'll have the ear of the media. Access to captains of industry. Unlimited poon- tang ... Sidetracked? Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ... Precisely. But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided. That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state. That's fine, Oswald. But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin. Oswald: We need one more thing. We need signatures. To overturn the ballot. I can supply those, Oswald. Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows I know. But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic! Don't look, Oswald. It's a surprise. You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you. And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ... Fred. Fred? He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and -- If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded. Yawn. That coulda come from anywhere. And exactly why am I gonna help you ? Well it's not working. What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me? My god ... it's true. The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h-- I damn well better be. In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them -- Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne. Selina?! Selina ... Selina ... Actually, it's a lot like that. I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle. And Interest Number One, is moi . And a very, very good one. ... Where did curiosity get the cat? And who ... would you say this to ? Why, how industrious. And how did you open protected files, may I ask? Working late? I'm touched.I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask! Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask. But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..? Better than you know, Bat-boy. Things change. Hey, good to meet you. We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future. Touring the riot scene. Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff. The name is Oswald Cobblepot. I oughta have you spayed! You sent out all the signals! Let's consummate our fiendish union! Well, a plan is forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ... Thanks. Jeez. Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number. Y'mean frame him? We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels. Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor. Oh, him again. He's already history -- check it out. Are you perchance a registered voter? I'm also a mayoral prospect. Huh? You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal? Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma? I'll warm ya! I got hot mitts --! But who could've ... no, don't say it. Silent night, violent night... The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- ! Okay, you have a point. Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves. I don't. So, no. You're coming with me, you Great White Dope! To die, way down in the sewer! Max! Relax! Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this. We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par-- He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control .. Reclaim my birthright, y'mean? I got my own ... quest to pursue up here. It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ... ... Want 'em to go apeshit. Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies. Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ... Sounds fun. But I ... "You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot." "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot." "I need you, Oswald. I need you now. That's the biggest parasol I ever --" A platform? Lemme see ... Stop global warming. Start global cooling. Make the world a colder place. Frigid ... I could teach her my "French flipper" trick... Wonder if it's worth my time. Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time? Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ... A big bag of fan mail? Filthy lucre? Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad? You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck. A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner? What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham? Most of all, I want to find out who I am. By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name. Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted. No, just give you a splitting headache. Quiet, Max. What do you think, this is a conversation? Actually this is all just a bad dream. You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
