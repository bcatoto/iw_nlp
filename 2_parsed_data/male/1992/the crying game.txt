Whatever you say. When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed. You could always make it up to her. She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself. Who knows the secrets of the human heart. He's what she should run a mile from. It takes all types. So let's call this the usual. Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that. So can we consider you a regular, sir? Scottish? Yeah. Fuck it, Dil. Saw it, Dil. Stop it, Dil -- Hi. Ask him yourself. I would expect he does. An excellent quality. Persistent. That's what he said. Jimmy. I've no thoughts on the subject. He agreed that he was. She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair. Now, that was a look. Saw that one. Nice. Yeah? Did he? See what, Dil?No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I? Look, I'm sorry. Don't chuck my clothes out! Fucking mad! Don't throw my clothes out the window! Please, Dil -- It's Dave. Cunt. Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt. Cunt. It's him, isn't it? Who the fuck is he? Don't be like that -- You fucking did. You fucking promised. C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!Fucking men, Col -- Fuck it, is what I say. You see that, Col? No. Tell him to go fuck himself. Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much. He's back, Col Ask him. Maybe he wants something. Good thing in a man. He's still looking, Col. Hi, Jimmy. What do you think his name is? Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col. What would you call it? What you think? Just cut his hair, you know. He gave me a look. See that, Col? Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy? Fuck off, Dave. Take your fucking goldfish, too! Fuck off back to Essex! Take your clothes. Sure, Dave -- Hey, Stirling fucking Moss -- He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me? Charming. See, they get the wrong idea. Maybe. Jimmy. Thank you. You heard me -- Did I? Fuck off, Dave. What's that supposed to mean? Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why. Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - - I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy? I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left. Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement -- Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon -- Meet Col -- Where am I to go, Jimmy? Promise? Will I see you again? Am I in trouble, Jimmy? Do I? Tell me what she wore. And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she? I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too -- What happened to Jimmy? What's Fergus? What was that she called you, Jimmy? I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it. And you'll never leave me? Say it again. What would you do for me? You do? Then say it. Tell me you love me. Love me. More endearments. Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more. You like me now, Jimmy? Let them come then. Try and go, then. Why? See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet. Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever. See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours. Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look. Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too. You tried. You didn't. You killed my Jody It was you... You killed my Jody? Died... Yes. You knew my Jody? You knew my Jody? You knew which man? Don't go like that. Jimmy? I will be. Only in times of extreme stress. Prescription. For my condition. My pills... You mean that? No! Tell me everything, Jimmy. So tell me. No! I'm going home... Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy. Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me. I'm going home! Why are we going here, Jimmy? For you... Why? Sorry. What you doing? You like me better like this. So it's true, then? You want to make me look like him... You're no good at this, Jimmy. You promise? And you wouldn't leave me? You'd like me better that way, Jimmy? Why? A girl has to draw the line somewhere -- You want another haircut, baby? Afraid so. Anything. Do you like me even a little bit? What you doing, Jimmy? And you're not going to tell me more? She from Scotland too? She own you, Jimmy? Why shouldn't I be jealous? I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry. She's the thing you had to tell me. It's her, isn't it? You following me? What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong -- You gonna tell me why? Why, honey -- Okay. Not at all, honey. He'd bring me carnations. Delirious. Only if you kiss me. Don't be cruel. I miss you, Jimmy. Please, Jimmy. A little. Stop it, Jimmy. Are you pretending yet? Absolutely. You can always pretend. Probably. Sorry. All right, they do. Details, baby, details. Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings. Know what, honey? When? Ask to meet me again. Make it up to me, then. That's a start. I know that. Nothing's wise. Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy. Made me feel all funny inside. My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant. You mean that? Do you care, Jimmy? And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared. See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes. Never said a truer word. Apologies, my sweet. Sorry, darling. Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon. Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say. Where? Tell him it hurt -- Tell him to stop messing Dil around -- He looks after me. He's a gentleman too. Even now. All the time. Told you, I'm superstitious. Why? What you thinking of, hon? No, depends on nothing. The thing is, can you go the distance? Can't leave me now. I'm superstitious. Drink. Drink. Why? You mean that? What does that mean? So what do you want with me, Jimmy? He did sometimes. Is this an obsession of yours? I am. A real gentleman... But you can t stay, you know that? Like you're concerned. You say that like a gentleman. What do you think? Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool. That's good... Are you jealous of him? You want to know how I kissed him? No -- Yes. No. As different as it's possible to be. He was different. Tried to. Sit down, will you? Doesn't know the meaning of the word. Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace? Jesus fucking Christ. What'll it be? Would you like a drink? I'm not on my own, am I? Piss off, Dave! The things a girl has to put up with. Jesus. You want one? You got a special friend, Jimmy? Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes? Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it? I wonder. They're jealous. The one you gave me in the Metro. Give me that look again. Half-five. At Millie's. Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane. But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap. You want me to ask you in, right? You can't leave me then, can you? God no. I'm a hairdresser. You know. He wants me to perform for him. Yes, thank you. They all get the wrong idea. Hi. You old-fashioned? Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col? Everybody wants something. Jimmy? He's Scottish, Col. Don't know. Who is she? That should make her happy. Like treacle. The accent, I suppose. Scottish? Not English. You American? What's it to you? What's his name? Who? Someone recommend you? A girl has to have a bit of glamour. Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday. Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose. Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy? You know her, Jimmy? Carnations.She's not a girl, Col -- How? I'm sorry. Then why doesn't she? So who's he? Thanks. Is that good or bad? Yeah. It's a simple question. If I was her I'd consider that an insult. What? She's not that either. She's not a tart. Do you mean that? It's not Pat. It's Jim. As the man said, it's in my nature. Please, Dil -- Fergus. Thirty-five. Stop it, Dil -- Don't call me that -- Yes. Say hello to Col -- The Metro. I promise. You will, Dil Not if you go. Yes. Now. You've got to go now, Dil -- Can't remember... Yes. She was -- Dil!!! It's my name, Dil -- Fergus. Never. I'd do anything for you, Dil. Anything. Yeah. Love you, Dil. Whatever you say, Dil. Yes. I like you, DIl More what? I like you, Dil -- Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here Got to be somewhere. Let me go, Dil Stop it, Dil -- He asked me to see were you all right. Okay. Don't you want to kill me? I suppose I tried. No. In a manner of speaking. Did you hear me? I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died. Are you listening? Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days. Your soldier. Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man. What? Good-bye, Dil Are you all right, Dil? Are you supposed to take that many? What condition? What pills? You heard what I said, Dil? Yes. You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil. I was trying to get out of something. Come on... I had to go to work! Told you to stay in the hotel! Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here? Look on it like a honeymoon. For me. Don't call me that -- Yes. What? No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes... I'm sorry. I promise. No. Yes. It's a secret. Want to change you to a man, Dil... You said anything, Dil No. Sit down. You got the keys to the shop? You'd do anything for me? You do something for me, Dil? More than that. I'm not sure. I can't. You could say that. Yes. Shouldn't be, Dil Kind of. What's her? Dil, this is Jude. Not here. No. Come on. Come on. Don't. So I got it wrong, then. What? Happy now? Okay. Be a good girl and go inside. Should have stayed a girl. No. Can't pretend that much. Don't ask me in. Sorry. Am I becoming repetitious? There's Dave. He knew too. I'm working on it. Won't be quite the same though, will it? That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he? Kind of wish I didn't. I should have known, shouldn't I? Don't. So they do know. Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl. Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that. Do they know? Whenever. Tonight. Will you meet me again? How? So I'm sorry. Kind of liked you as a girl. I didn't mean to hit you. You think that's wise? I said stop it. Shut up. Yeah. I care, Dil. Sure I do. You could? Must be. You're something else, Dil, you know that? Give it over, Dil -- Don't call me that. What you doing here? Come on, Dil -- I have to talk to her, Col -- Dil -- No... Did he ever tell you you were beautiful? I'm wondering why you keep his things. I'm thinking of your man. Depends what it is. Aha. What is this? If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. Yeah. Something I heard someone say once. Want to look after you. Did he dance with you? Maybe. Did he come here too? Shouldn't you be in mourning? Didn't think I could. Do I? I think you do. Do you miss him? What would he think? Maybe. Yes... Did you do that to him? Shouldn't I go? Tell me about him. How different? He lived here with you? Must be in love to manage that. Someone out there. Whiskey. Yes, please. Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own? That Dave? Jesus Christ! How special? Must be. Like what? Why? What's that about? What look? Where? No, I didn't -- He's getting up. You on the game? Perform? What was that all about? You all right? What was that? Hi. You forgot your bag. Must be. Not me. Jimmy. Tell her I'm very happy with it. Who's she? And what's it like? How'd you guess? No. No. Nothing. Doesn't the water get to your nails? Guy I work with. In a way. Need to lose myself awhile. Need to go across the water. That's wise, Tommy. You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping? Dil! I take pride in my work. Who's the old geezer? Jude? You may be right. And what if you don't? And what happens then? Was I? And what if I say no? And then you'll leave her out of it? Of course. I forgot. But, then, I don't have a choice. She's nobody. She likes me. Leave her out of this. No way, Jude. I'm out. What do you mean? No, what is the thing? Yes. He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen. Suits you. I know. I heard. Leave me alone, Jude. He's hot. Leave us, Judie. Tough work, that. You don't know that. Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart. Poke him or something. See if he's still alive. Have a look at him. Did you give him it? Hey -- what's he like? See does he want some. Kind of suicide, isn't it? So it's on the street. Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in. Hope not. Thank God for that. Who is he? A hotel? Aye, I do, Peter. Just a girl. Definitely unusual. I understand. I know that. He's at home. I thought it was Dave. So it was you all the time. I'm sure. Would make me feel better about it. Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight -- Peter. I'm a volunteer, am n't I? Why? Yes. Back in a minute, Jody I told him. It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all. Thanks. He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like. And anyway, he's seen our faces. The poor whore's suffocating in the heat. Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy. Give him a cup of tea. Hurling -- Hurling -- I said you bastard -- stop -- You stupid bastard -- You won't run. Cricket's in the halfpenny place. The fastest. Stop that talk now -- Why? No. Me? No, I'm not good for much... Nothing. I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things... When I was a child... Like the one about the frog? What? Go to sleep now. How can I? Don't. Stop it -- I told you not to talk that way -- I don't know her. Don't think that way. What? Don't know her. You liked her? She can't help it. I didn't. Is it bad? Yes. That you guys shouldn't be here. Depends on what you believe in. We don't look on it like that. Do you? The best. Oh, yeah. Who's Dil? Having two pints in the Rock. Like what? Having a pint in the Rock. Doesn't matter where. Don't be so sure. Why? So what's that supposed to mean? Yeah? Shut up, would you? Give us a break. Hurry up, would you? Can't. Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree. My pleasure, Jody I'll bear that in mind. How different? The fastest. Best game in the world. Ever see hurling? And you play cricket?. Shouldn't take it personally. Why did you sign up? You could have said no. What the fuck were you doing here? What? She's a friend of mine So what were you fucking around for, then? You make a nice couple. She your wife? No? Why not? She'd be anyone's type. What? No. Didn't look like that to me... No, what's the funny thing? Shut the fuck up, would you? What the fuck do you know about my people? What do you know about my nature? Why can't we? I'm not a gambling man. They won't let him die. What makes you think that? Do what? What is it now? But I won't. We're more polite around these parts. Well, I could say the same about you. You trying to hurt my feelings? No? What's that? No fucking way. Can't we take it off? How did you know it was her? My pleasure. Am I? So, what do I look like? How is it a farce? What do you mean you can't? Eat something, would you? Yeah.What? Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called? Got to catch me first -- What you say, faster? But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back -- So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there? Faster than cricket? Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus? Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro -- I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus? Take the hood off, Fergus -- Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus? Tell me something, anything. What does that mean? Yeah? And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything. A story. I don't want to sleep. Tell me something. I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette. Help me. I'm sorry. Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking -- Take the whole lot. I won't need it. Take her picture. C'mere. See if she's all right. But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her. If they kill me -- Want you to do something, Fergus. Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too? Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all. Some kinds of women are... No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus? It's as simple as that? What do you believe in? I've often wondered how you do it. Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you? But you fellas never get a break, do you? We got simple tastes, you and me. My special friend. Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita. Like having a pint in the Metro -- You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring. Come on, man. If this shit was all over. Where would you most like to be now, man? Jody's always right. See? I was right about you. 'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature. Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man. Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you. Fergus? I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus. Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well. Now put it back in. These things take time, Fergus. Now, that was worth waiting for. Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you? Tree. Nice to meet you, Fergus. So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler. Toffs' game there. But not at home. . Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different. Never. That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other? Best game in the world. "Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham. It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face. Can't. Once I signed up. I got sent. What the fuck am I doing here. Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand. You fuckers set me up. That bitch -- Don't I know it. Suppose you could say that. Absolutely not. She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you. Don't you think of it, fucker. My inside pocket. Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something. C'mere. She's not my type. I didn't even fancy her. And you know the funny thing? Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go. I'm talking about your people, not you. Not in your nature. And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose. You want to bet? They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me. Kill me. You're going to have to do it, aren't you? Hey -- So I've noticed. Could you? No. It's the truth. Nope. Not handsome at all. Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup. Only joking. Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself. Please, man, I'm suffocating in here. I can smell her perfume. Thank you, handsome. Yeah. And the brown eyes. You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face. I seen your fucking face. This is a farce, man. Can't eat through a canvas bag. Can't. Fuck you. He believes in the future -- He's a good soldier, Jude. Have you no feelings, woman? Nice lady. Thought you liked me, bitch. Whatever you say, Jude... I never know nothing. Who gives a fuck. And you know what? Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude. What if I did? Don't run off, Jude. No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.Right. Right. Good. So what do you think? You being cynical, Hennessy? Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target. It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond. So what do you think that is, Hennessy? Good. And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you? And who is she? And what's she like between the sheets? Fuck you, too -- I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy? Should blow you away, you know that? And who's Dave when he's at home? Who'd you think it was? Okay. You're a good man, Fergus. You sure about that? Why do you want to do that for? What? Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus. Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days. You OK about that? Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why. And do you know why? You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me? Are you all there? So he knows your name? You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep. What the fuck is this? It's your decision. You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at. You sure? So? Why would you do that? Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers. Do you want a cup of tea? Give me the fucking shooter! Give me the shooter, Jude -- That fucker's dead -- That true, Fergus? You in love? Shut the fuck up, Jude.Aha. Do you now. So what do you need, Fergus? All right, then. I like to be wise. You'll notice I've asked you nothing. Fergus!
