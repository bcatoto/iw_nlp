My God... ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife... Well... uh... thanks... Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or... ...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat... I... um... God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?! How'd you know that? Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream-- There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes. That's Renee alright. I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know? Pretty much so. Yes... why? Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive. What? He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious... I had a little run-in with Zowie. What do they do up there? Out? Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way. Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in. So where're we going? All set. Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die. What are you talking about? Geoff, dinner's ready! Geoff?! "Out." Well that's great, Geoff. Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again... Hey! Where're you off to? Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him. Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't. I think so. You alright? Hey! How was your first day at school? You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you... What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten? What's wrong?! It's been a few years.Zowie... I'm not trying to prove anything. I was burying my dog. Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are. Just until he heals up? Is he gonna be okay? You ever think about running away? I gotta go back and do my chores... I don't know... ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you... I don't know but I'm not taking any chances... It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie... It's weird... Maybe it takes a while... You think he'd believe it if he did? He was dead. You know he was. Yeah... I've never had anyone die before... ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually... You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule... Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try? What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works... ...he'll come back alive. The old Indian burial ground. This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed. There's a better place... I'm not burying him here... Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here... Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad. I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead... Sorry about your mom. I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus... I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before. Zowie.Anywhere but here. All set? He did. We buried him. There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive. I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back... I'm not hungry. I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep? Just out. I'm going out, Dad! Who was that? I still can't believe she's dead... What? It sucked. I'll be fine, Dad. Sure. Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs. How long ago did this guy retire? All the time. Go later... Dies? Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus? What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us? What do you mean? How can he not have a heartbeat? You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better? Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him. It's getting pretty late. We better go. You never get over it. You want me to help? Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out. Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself... What did? Why not? Is this a good spot? What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life? You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad. He pissed me off. What's his name? Mom... I know, Mom. Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight... I mean... he misses you, Mom... Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool. Right here, Mom...I was building a doggy door. I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now. --Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this? When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys. I suppose so. I hear you moved into town. Did she always have reporters following her around like this? Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law. Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove? Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass. Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner. Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander... You took over for Doctor Yolander? Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea. I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
