I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock. You're out of control, Curran. Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi. There's no smoking in this building. When did you start drinking again? Were you drinking? All night? Where were you tonight? Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it? I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here. The boat blew. There was a leak in the gas line. There were two previous repairs. There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em. A real heavy investigation. Zilch. Goose-egg. It was an accident. You're on leave, man. You're on psycho leave. I'm talking to a possible whacko here. Take care, you hear? We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing. A professor. Icepick. In his bed. Multiple stab wounds. 1977.Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell? Did you ever tie him up? Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him? Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz? There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell. I'm John Corrigan. I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms. Tramell. Can we get you anything? Would you like some coffee?I hope I helped you out. Nope. She did. Like I say. It never panned. The usual -- a girlfriend. Nope. There was some talk; it never panned. That's him. Nope, can't say that I do. Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine. I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question. What's this about anyway? No suspects, no motive. Unsolved. .38 revolver. Never recovered. He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic. Somebody drove by and shot him.That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady? What kind of drugs? Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell? I like that. "Suspension of Disbelief." How's that? It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time. You workin' on another book? You have the right to an attorney. Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you -- He was murdered. She said alone -- suite 405. It ain't gonna take long. Where the hell you goin'? You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got. You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after? Oh, man. Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes. There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened. She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is. How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened? If she's telling you the truth. So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what. You don't know what the hell was in it? Which one you talkin' about now, son? We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain. Ain't that hard, son. This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em. Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present. She used Daddy's razor. Why not? You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends? She's right. You got an icepick in you yet? You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car? I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car. In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no. I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch. Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else. How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle. That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger. He winks at her. The woman looks away from him, shaking her head. Why the hell not? I feel fine! Say what? What in the hell for? You think I'm gettin' any at my age? I don't like blue-haired women. I don't like 'em. I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS! You... fucked her! Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch -- I went over last night, too. Everybody that she plays with dies. Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass? Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that. I don't son, but I got the minority opinion. Somethin', though. What is it you got between you? You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that. No, sir. You won't. There's smoke off yonder on the horizon. They're gonna want your badge. What's goin' down, son? Hell yes! Couldn't get it outta my head for years. Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems. One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em. All of 'em. Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it. Sweet as honey. Said she didn't know why she done it. No, sir. They never even got a statement from her. I came in here to jack off the damn machine. One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what? He was her counselor. Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine? What you doin', son? Hallelujah. How'd it go, son? I'm a smart sonofabitch. I just hide it. Ain't that cute? They got his and her Pig-assos, son. They're executives. They're nervous about everything. Not now he don't. I never heard of him. Who was this fuckin' guy? You're already gettin' psychological input, son. He looks a little shrunk, that's all. He ain't that way. He's got heart. Maybe it's for old-time's sake. Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch. Maybe the maid did it. What was the motive? Were you with him last night? When was the last time you saw John Boz? Homicide.Go stick your head in a tub of ice water. See where she leads. You look like dogshit. Yeah. I know. Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs. Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face. Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it. She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds. I told you to stay away from Tramell. You knew her, didn't you? Don't fuck with me, Nick. I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling. You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way -- Tell me again. I want to hear you say it again. First you've got her buying your file. Now you've got her killing Nilsen. Forget her, willya? Go someplace. Sit in the sun. Get away from this goddamn fog. Get her out of your system. Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people? I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen. They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation. I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him? Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published. Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything. I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus. Fuck you, too Nick. How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too? Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written. What are you -- a book critic? How the fuck do you know? What is it with you and this broad anyway? What now what? Now nothing. She passed the polygraph. That's it. You sure? And you volunteered. What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride. We bring her in for questioning. You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer. She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about? Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased -- I said keep it. Keep your three o'clock. He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight. That's the last time anybody saw him. Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook. She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility. Catherine Tramell. Age 30. No priors, no convictions. Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980. Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir. Estimated assets $110 million. She's a suspect.Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time? Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him? I'd have to be really dumb to do that. What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking? A couple days ago. Yeah, I was drinking. Yeah. Home. Watching TV. No. Okay. I went after him. I lost my temper. Bring 1976 up. It's not gonna take long, Sam. Thanks. You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find? Did you find out about her parents? She was there, wasn't she? Don't! I know about your husband. You still like girls, Beth? Put your fucking hands up! Don't move. Put your hands up! You should do something about this lock. Why did you change your name? She didn't hand you to me. She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson. You saw all the reports, Beth! Did you know Noah Goldstein? What did she tell me, Beth? Tell me about Catherine. I thought you hardly know her. What is this interest you've got in her? I don't need any help. Beth. I didn't mean what I said. About -- What was she like in school? She knows stuff about me that only you know. No. I mean it, thank you. You did it for me. Yeah? Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out. But take my advice. Put a little more life into it than you usually do. I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything. We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times? It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations. Who? It's Internal Affairs, isn't it? Don't, Beth. Don't lie to me. Who's got access to my goddamn file? I need a cigarette. Why didn't you tell me? She said what you said she'd say. Who? What else is new? What are you doing here? Yeah. Thank you. It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here? No! I'm working my tail off. I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore. No. It's been three months. My sex life is fine. My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again. Things are fine. I told you. They're fine. It's bullshit. You know it is. I'm fine. Come on, Beth! You know I'm fine! How the hell long do I have to keep doing this? We fuck like minks. We forget the rugrats. We live happily ever after. We fuck like minks. We raise rugrats. We live happily ever after. What is this -- some kind of... Joke? Are we playing games again? How did it end? Why? Why not? They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after. A detective. He falls for the wrong girl. I'm writing a book. No thanks. I have to do some research tomorrow. No. You didn't not see me long enough to miss me. How'd you get in here? No. I did, too. She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did. I found Lisa Henderson. You like to hang out with murderers or what? Did you know Roxy -- Can I talk to you a minute? He asked if I had an icepick in me yet. I don't know. What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character? You paid $50,000 for your character? Why? When? Try me. No? I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets. Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too. Do you think she killed Johnny Boz? It's OK. It's OK. No. Did you like her to watch? I know. I don't have a choice. I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty. Are you kidding? You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation? It hurts. How's your shoulder? How about Roxy? Is she a fuck to the century, too? What did you think? I told her it was the fuck of the century. Maybe she saw something she didn't see before. I'll meet you there. How's your new book? To see if I can get away with it. I'll risk it. No. Yes. When did you write it? Why does he do it? What's it about? What do you want from me, Catherine? There's Pepsi in the fridge. What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you? My wife used to call me that. What if I asked you not to call me Shooter? What did you pay Nilsen? Ice? Jack Daniel's okay? It's gonna have to be. You can make a mistake. Don't get too cocky. Yeah. Would you like to come up and have a drink? I like you. I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend. How exactly did you hear? I didn't. No. Didn't you study it in school? She wiped out her whole family. You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins? Tell me about Professor Goldstein. They were drug buys. I was a vice cop. It was an accident. They got in the line of fire. You tell me. I'd like to ask you a few more questions. No, thanks. Am I... disturbing you? I don't know anything that isn't police business. How do you know all this stuff about me? I passed. Why not? It's got to be tiring to beat that machine. Sure. Even though you were fucking him. Because you didn't love him -- But you didn't hurt -- How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach. How did you feel when he died? You like playing games, don't you? Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him. But you said you liked men to use their hands. I told them you wouldn't want to hide. I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present. What's your new book about? I told you -- I quit. I thought you were out of cigarettes. I quit. I don't smoke. Do you always keep old newspapers around? If that's the way you want to play it. Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us. Was there anyone with you last night? Did you go home with him? Did you leave the club with him? Were you with him last night? How long were you having sex with him? How long were you dating him? I'm De... You did. Thanks. He had a girlfriend? What kind of talk? Was she ever a suspect? Nilsen? Do you remember his name? Routine. Was his wife ever a suspect? Were there ever any suspects? What was the weapon? I'm going with you. I know what happened. Catherine told me what happened. She's a writer -- it's part of what she does. He was I.A. He probably asked her about it. Don't you get it, Gus? If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley. It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen. Catherine told me what was in it. I'm not sure anymore she did it. I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop. You're my friend, Gus. I don't believe it. Catherine says you don't like her. Come on, I'll drive you in this thing. You all right, pop? You want me to drive you? It doesn't make sense. She didn't know me three months ago. I don't know. I'm just not. I'm not afraid of her. You feeling better? You don't like punk rockers? You oughta use a rubber, pop. You really should. I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it. I always use a rubber. I wasn't there last night, either. Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there. I know what that's like. She want to play? Fine. I can play. I don't think it's funny. You think I -- I don't know. She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me. I got tired of being played with. Nothin' I'll be okay, pop. Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins? Was she ever suspect? What are you doing here, Pop? It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop? She doesn't know me. I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her. She misses me. I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus. Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about? Before your time, pop. Mid-sixties. Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now. Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz. Yeah. But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car. Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house. All we did was write her name down. I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you? It was an accident. You don't but it, do you? She knew nobody would but it. She knew I'd say she did it. And she knew nobody would buy it. Catherine Tramell. It's part of her game. She killed him. No. What about me? Fuck you, Phil. How did they die? Was there an investigation? Come on, Phil. You're not gonna let this slide. What about her parents? What about what else she's published? At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence. She knew she could beat it. That's why she asked to take it. Now what? I'm sure. She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody. So what do we do -- nothing? I love it. She's got a hundred million bucks. She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars. And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads. Are you kidding me? Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to -- What was it? He was shot. Can there be some mistake? Can you check again? Did you check all four years? How old was she when this happened? Who are you? Why do you think he's dead? We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell. It's yours. She's got enough money to burn this whole department down. On what basis?
