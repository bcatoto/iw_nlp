Not on station time. And I believe what you say. But this is TV. No pictures, no story. Right. Like last night's doozie. C'mon, Joey. I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here. What, you think I'm kidding? I guarantee it. An inch more flank. Boys upstairs get hot. Bingo, you're an anchor-woman. I mean hardly any thigh. I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.You wanted a story. You got it. Turn on the TV now. And then get your ass down here ... ... OK. Be careful. And lighten up. Story of your life could be right round the corner. Joey .... Look, you wanna ride? I can go by your place. Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery. But that's all it is. Mystery. Not malice. What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?The Box, Joey. He wants the Box. Your apartment. This is his first night on Earth. He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back. He has to destroy it. Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another. You're stronger than you think. I like you, Joey. You ask all the right questions. There is something we can do but it will require great courage. He'll do what he does best. But he'll do it unfettered. He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering. Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws. The protocol of Hell. The Box had to be opened to let me out. The truly innocent were safe. That's no longer true. The shell of the beast has been fleshed. What I was is out there, Joey. In your world. Unbound. Unstoppable. Something bad. The cusp of my life. What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision. I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery. The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently. This is me a few years later. We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921. I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see. So many dead. For us God, too, fell at Flanders. We adjusted to the loss. And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further. I went further. I thought I was a lost soul. But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant. Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey. And we have to stop it. I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true. Will you walk with me a while? Well done. Brave girl. You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right? Correct. The fields of France. And many dead flowers ... Oh. Forgive me. My name was Spenser. Elliott Spenser. Captain. You have to help me. You will understand. And no, you're not dreaming. Do you know where we are?Right. Like you were hog-tied or something. I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life. And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else. Get dressed. Get out. It doesn't bother me. I'm just not interested. Unh-unh. No. Thank you. Yes really. ... Let it define you. Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month. Don't do that! Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it... Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar. And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty. He's a barman. Whatever. Do you mind if I continue? You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ... It's yours. You won it. It's a prize. Thank you. Uh-huh. Welcome. 38 How do we start? But how in God's name ... Hey, that's what makes the world go round. What!? What are you talking about? Why should I help you? Fuck you! No! No. It's not the same ... I ... No. What you did ... it was ... evil. Yes. That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway. What ... What ... ? Yes! God, yes. I ... I just want to hug you. To hold you. To tell you it's alright. Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me. You know that. It was my fault, babe, it really was. And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now. I hate to see you in pain like this. That's terrible. What a bitch. She was obviously just using you, Terri. Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore. Sure. Sure. I understand. It's cool. I mean, we've got all night. Terri, listen. Why don't you come here and kiss me? I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right? Is it going to happen? Isn't it going to happen? Let's get it out of the way. See how we feel. Then we can relax. Talk. You know. Not now, no. I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean? Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up. Put her heart and soul into it. No. But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it. You found a real treasure for me, Terri. I hope I can show you how grateful I am. C'mon. It'll be great. Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over? You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk. Just see how we both feel? That's so good to hear, sweetheart. It really is. You know, I .. are you alone? I know. I know. It's bad. I'm a bad person. But I try not to be, Terri. I really do. And I really miss you. Hey, it has been known. C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy. I have regrets. I'd like to put things right. Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh? No. I mean, really? Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart. I care about you. I guess I miss you. I'm sorry we split up. I'm sorry I ... Really? Will you relax? Your little girlfriend left a card, remember? Live and in the flesh. How're you doing, babe? Not quite.It has already begun. God? My God was diamond and black light. And I was his Dark Pope. All that is changed. A terrible beauty is born. With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes. You see, we're not so dissimilar. A dark star rising. I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed. A friend relieved me of that inconvenience. Now I'm free. Born again of Blood and Desire. Because you want to. You've always wanted to. Look at your pictures. Look at your sculptures. Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine. Imagine a world of the body as canvas. The body as clay. Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you. Don't flee from yourself. If you have a quality, let it define you. Cultivate it. It is you. By helping me, you will help yourse... I understand. Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional. What else could you do? Good. So did I. And that's all ... On the contrary. It has everything to do with the world. And our dreams of how it will succumb to us. You enjoyed the girl? What did you see? The same as I. Appetite sated. Desire indulged. You saw the working of the world in miniature.
