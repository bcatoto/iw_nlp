I never was much for the holidays. What's the first thing, man? What's  the first thing you're gonna do? Haven't thought about it. Hell you haven't. Get to thinking about it, it won't  happen. We walk outta here, we hit that road,  what's the first thing you're gonna  do. Ain't there yet. Three days, man. Not yet. Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin,  Christmas on the outs. Hot chocolate. What? Get a hot mug of chocolate. First thing I'm gonna do. And a slice of pecan pie, right? And some pecan pie. She's gonna be out there, man. Right  there. Right there waiting. Yeah. Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and  right into her arms. Yeah. Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing  her own damn sheets, you read that  part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves  in the whole week, drinking wine,  taking baths, man, see if they got  those room service steaks... anything  I want to do. Remember when she wrote  that? Anything I want... Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas. All those pictures she's sent...  y'know... you sure they're all of  her, Nick? You hear sometimes they  don't send their real pictures. Could  be her cousin or something. Why you gotta say a thing like that. I'm just saying. Why you gotta. We were gonna give  you a ride someplace, man. Now I  just don't know. I'm just talking. Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy. I'm gonna marry this girl. Hey, hey, listen here. "I've made my  list and I've checked it twice, and  as long as you're naughty, it's gonna  be nice. These cold winter weeks  have been killing me, Nick, as I lie  here alone. It's not enough to have  your warmth in my heart anymore; I  need your warmth next to me. Work at  Penney's has been busy because it's  Christmas and that's when we do almost  half of our business for the whole  year -- ", okay, whatever, whatever -- " -- my manager's still mad at me  for asking for the whole week off,"  whatever, whatever -- Here we go. "And all that gets me  through the day is to close my eyes  and imagine holding you, and kissing  you, and touching you, and tasting  you everywhere because I know at  that moment, I'll feel I've found  the reason for my whole entire life." For twenty-five, she sounds pretty  mature. Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you  get matured real quick. Sure as hell don't make me miss Millie  Bobek. Guess I owe Millie, though.  If I hadn't been rollin, her, I woulda  never ended up here. And I woulda  never met Ashley. That's the world for ya. What if she sees you, man, sees what  you look like... and it's not there.   You just don't do it for her. Me and her got a connection. Read this part. Read the part about  stuffing her stocking. She's using a new perfume. No, I think that's just oranges. She  writes here she's eating oranges. Oh. Shoulda written to that magazine,  Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here,  walk right into a relationship. Not  some one-nighter, man... a  relationship. You? You're gonna walk  outta here with bus fare. Searching  for the drunkest skirt in the room. Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog? Shoulda written, Rudy... Shoulda got yourself a girl. All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw,  and sit down for Christmas dinner.  Watch some ball with my old man,  sleep in my old bed, and have  leftovers for bout six months. Thought you hated Sidnaw. Just taste that Christmas turkey. Thought you hate your old man. Five years, Nicky. Five years. I just want to go home. Well, man. Me and Ashley. We'll be  thinking about you. Shit. Alamo's back. Don't look like he missed the  sunlight. Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm  the one ratted on him beating up  Cree. Since I was there, I saw it,  he thinks I got him sent to solitary. Aw, Rudy. Count me outta mealtime -- GET BACK IN LINE! I'm not hungry, I'm gonna -- SHOULDA STAYED IN YOUR HOLE! GET What the fuck is this? Holiday jello. What's this shit in it? Swallow and see. Just so you know, this man and I are  outta here in two days. So while  we're inhaling London broil and  lobster bisque, you're gonna still  be standing here smelling up the  mystery creamfuck. Who's in prison now? When you don't expect it. It wasn't me, Alamo -- That's when. Two days. So maybe after our week beneath the  sheets, we'll head down to Motor  City for New Year's. She says her  roommate's skipping town for a few  days, have the place to ourselves.   Remember how her brother's a truck  driver down there? I'm thinking he  might be able to help get me some  work. What, working security? No, I'm through with that shit.  Ashley's right. Gotta start doing  something I got a stake in. Get a  business going. I don't know, I've seen the business  world. Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify  as a small business. Chop shop  consultant; doesn't work on a resume. Ashley's talking about maybe we can  start something up together... Whatsa matter, Zook? The hell you doing, Zookerman? Just a roach, Zook. Good for you. Protein. Monsters in the gelatin... It's a roach, guy -- There are monsters... ...in the gelatin... Oh, man -- THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN! Fuckin, Zookerman -- THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! Sonofabitch! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! SIT DOWN! SIT THE FUCK BACK DOWN! Rudy, don't move -- Two days, we got two days! Don't do  nothing. Don't touch nothing -- Don't move, Rudy! Standing right here, man! Ate the jello, jello was fine! RUDY, LOOK OUT! NICK! GUARD! GUARD! Alamo... GUARD!!! Jesus, Rudy -- Take it, man! You're all right!   Hold it in! GUARD! Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus... GUARD!!! Ash... Ashley... No, man! No, no, no! Tell her... I'll be there ... You're GONNA be there! We're getting  outta here! TAKE IT! Tell Ashley... I... YOU TELL HER! ...be with her... NO!!! ...for Christmas... NICK!!! GET HIM OUT OF HERE! LOCK DOWN! NICK!!! The man had two days... Well. Least he won't be coming back. You need company tonight, Rudy...  you just give a holler. Rudy, man, here we go, here, what  she wrote here: "The car's waiting.  The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting.   I've waited for so long. I'm burning  for you, Nick. My whole body. My  whole heart. I'm burning for you..." He was burning for you too... Your world and welcome to it,  dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now!  We'll keep the lights on for ya! Don't do it, Rudy... Don't do it ... You Ashley? I'm Nick. I like your coat. This -- this is just something they  gave me at the door. Wasn't snowing  when we signed up, y'know? How's your coffee? Gotta be ten degrees out there. Negative five? I don't think it's negative five. Wind chill. That's probably what  they meant. I was scared. Scared you were gonna  take one look at me and change your  mind. Scared I was walking into  heartache. All those words... you  put a picture in your mind of where  they come from and when you see where  maybe it's not the same as your  picture. No, no -- No, hey, I like your coat -- Ashley, no. That was me, that's what  I was scared of. I mean, be serious...   I ain't exactly looking like Mr.   Universe here. I can get another one going. Y'know,  hey, whatever you want me to -- Do that again. Smile. One more. Smile. One more. I've been dreaming about that smile,  Ashley Mercer. For a long time. Tell me something. This the first  time you've ever done this? No, not that, no... I mean this, the whole thing. Start  writing to a guy, guy in the bricks.  Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me  the truth. Yeah. Me too. Why? I mean I know why for me, why I  paid for the ad. But you... why start  writing to some guy -- some con --  you don't even know? Tell me again. Had some bad relationships, didn't  you. Well, wasn't all me, y'know. Guy I was in with... he helped  sometimes... some of the romantic  stuff, actually... you'd like him -- Y'know, some of the heart mighta  been his too... Where the hell are you going? Ashley, Jesus -- Ash... didn't you write me that you  don't eat chocolate? Ash, you've gotten me enough -- Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I  haven't gotten you anything -- It's two hundred dollars, Ash -- Beauty and fragrances. Just for the holidays, Nick. Then  we'll tell her. We'll let her...  have her holidays... You can't find... what? Toys for... adults? We sell children's toys -- Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in  aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four. Well, I don't know about that -- Security, Ash, I just worked security.   They wouldn't be rolling out the red  carpet -- We'll have more fun in Detroit. Ashley. We're not going anywhere I  used to work. Hey. I been in prison for two years,  Ash. Believe me. Those guys wouldn't  want to see me. I'll see what I can do. I have no gifts to bring, parum-pum- pum-pum. No treasures for the king,  pa-rum-pum-pum-pum... ...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum... Hi, Nick. What the fuck -- HEYYY!!! IN HERE!!! HEYYY!!! Welcome home, Nick. I owe ya a drink, ya fuck -- You... you don't know me -- Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you  real well. No, you can't -- The hell I can't. ASHLEY! NO! Hope her taste in men's better than  her taste in Christmas. Hey, sis. Happy holidays. Jumpy, don't hurt her, now. So. This is the guy you been waiting  for. Man of your dreams. Must have a way with stationery. You better be here to be good to  her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been  good to you. Read a lot about you, Nick. Read you're a man of some knowledge. A man of some travels. I'm... not... Nick... I'm not him. I... You want something from Nick, you  got the wrong guy. Who are you now. You got the wrong guy! She thinks  I'm Nick, I'm not! Put him in the truck. I was in the joint with him! I knew  about him and her, okay!? I took his  place! You what... I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended  I was him! I knew about her letters!   Jesus Christ, whatever you want from  him -- I'm not Nick! I -- I just wanted to be -- You're not Nick Mason... I shared his cell! But you were saying you were... Yes! So you could get with my sister. Yes! So you could get down her chimney. Yes! And you think telling me that's gonna  help your cause. Is this him!? Is this the fucker you been writing  all year!? IS THIS NICK MASON!!?? Well, he's gonna have to learn to  give you some respect. Hey. They got a shitload of cookies. Take 'em. How 'bout the tree? You want the  tree? Leave the tree. I've read your letters, motherfucker.   Don't play no reindeer games with  me. Hey there, Monster! What're you  hauling this far north? Hell, Bugeye. How you doin'? Ain't  hauling, man, I'm up for the holidays.  Gonna have myself a holiday... for a  goddamn change... Your brother... ...the truck driver... What the fuck is going on. What's going ON!!! You motherfucker. You sold him out. When'd you decide to do it, Ash?   After which of his letters, huh?   The fortieth? The fiftieth? The  first?! I'M NOT NICK! JESUS CHRIST! Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas. I'M NOT NICK! Get the hell off of me! You're not hearing me here -- He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did  he. You told him about Nick's letters. You're in on this. Y'know, in a way, I'm glad it's me.  'Cause you woulda broken his heart. Your pen palls dead, lady. Nick died for me.... ...maybe I die for Nick... "My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy, I have  been dreaming of you constantly, and  knowing you are out there makes these  walls not seem so close or so strong  or so cold..." Women live for this stuff. Dreaming 'bout your this, dreaming  'bout your those, gettin' X-rated on  me here, Nicky... where are we...  oh, right, other side... "Someday I'm gonna take you up by  Lake S. Before I went in, before  goddamn Millie, 'fore I had my  situation, I used to work up at this  casino, working security. Used to  watch for people stealing chips,  counting cards, getting piss-drunk,  that kinda shit. Indian place, they  hired this reject outta Vegas to run  it, got about as much business sense  as a buffalo patty. Anyways, it's a  fun place to run some numbers and  play." You're a good writer, Nick. I give  this writing an A-plus. I never worked at no casino. That's the guy I was in with, I did  my last ten months with him. He rode  a two-year bit for manslaughter --  split a guy's skull open at a bar  for harassing his girl. That's Nick  Mason. He worked at that casino.  He's the one who wrote her letters.   Me, I'm a damn mechanic, my last job  was a Quickie Lube, I did five for  lifting cars. I don't know shit about  blackjack, I don't know shit about  Indians. I'm not him. Bury this guy. I promised that when he helped us,  we'd be gone! When he helped us!   Loverboy don't want to play! And you promised me you'd get your  sweetheart to help! He'd rather die than be with you,  he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend  anyway. Bury him all over the place. Beats prison, I guess. The problem with prison... is that  it is founded on the fundamentally  flawed perception of rehabilitation  through punishment. A society can't  hope to create a "changed man" by  surrounding him with the worst in  his fellow man; what it  "rehabilitates" is solely a conviction  that if he can survive the inhumanity  of prison, what then, can he not  withstand? He has seen man's darkest  soul and kept his sight: what is  left for such a man? What faith?  What fear? Don't get no blood on my boots -- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW! About the Tomahawk! What the hell do  you want to know! I spend six months writing poetry  and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over.  Thanks for the stamps, Ash. You want  me, you got me. Whaddya want to know. Everything. Hey. She says she loves you, Nick. She says a lot of things. She's getting you to help us... 'cause  she knows if you don't, you're dead.  You just tell us what we need to  know, you two live happily ever after.   My sister loves you, motherfucker,  and I ain't gonna have you break her  heart. Wish I had a brother like you. A girl says she loves you, you say  something. I had better sex in prison. Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna  be working together here. Get him back in the rig. He's not the guy, Monster. Whole time you were driving, he was  telling her he's not the guy, he's  not the guy. I know why he'd tell us  he's not the guy. why's he telling  her he's not the guy? What if he's  not the guy? The man who wrote those letters loved  Ashley, boys. He lived for her love. Let's see him live for love. Where's she work? What? Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't  she? Where's she work? J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances. What's her middle name? Samantha. What'd they call her in high school? Bam Bam. What'd they call her in college? What college. Where'd she drop her cherry? Canada. Be more specific. A station wagon in Canada. What's her greatest fear? Her brother. Wrong, Nick. It's drowning. No. It's her brother. That's love. Let's get back on the road. It's  time to start talking, Nick. Time to  start telling tales -- Nick don't talk till Nick gets  something. Hot. Chocolate. You want that for here or to go? I been in Iron Mountain for two years,  truck driver. I do one more crime,  I'm back there for good, so fuck you  and fuck your sister and fuck your  trucker friends. You want to hear  about some goddamn job of mine? I  want some hot-goddamn-chocolate. And some pecan-fucking-pie. So when you worked there -- You knew the place -- Hey. Y'know, I could really go for some  onion rings. We're talking, aren't we? How much money's in that casino?   Day-to-day. I don't know. The hell you don't. Five million? You wrote Ash that letter, you told  her that story 'bout working Christmas  Eve, bout how they'd send half the  security guys home, nobody comin, in  that night. And the rest of you got  shit-faced drinking hot buttered  rum. That a true story now? Christmas... Eve... You know where the guards are. You  know how to get in and out. You know  where the money is. We're taking down that casino,  convict. You're the guy gonna tell  us how. Hey, it's... been two years -- We got faith in you, Nick Mason. You're our inside man. ...goddamn it, Rudy... goddamn it...  goddamn girl, goddamn Nick... you're  so smart, so fucking smart... Where's your Christmas dinner now... I've read where the retail industry  does fifty percent of its business  between December 1st and December  25th. Half the year's business, in  one month's time. It seems to me an  intelligent society would legislate  a second such gift-giving holiday,  create, say, a Christmas Two -- late  May, early June -- to further  stimulate growth and prosperity. For  who would protest such a holiday?  Taking the fifty percent model, a  Christmas Two would grow this  country's annual per capita income  by close to one-third. Christmas Two. Ever since you started night school,  you been givin, me headaches, Jumpy.   Headaches. Go see what's taking him. Here ya go, convict. We cased the  place in the fall, got the layout  down. What you're gonna do is show  us where each of these doors go,  what the upstairs level looks like,  where they got the alarms, all of  it. And where they hide the real money. And Nick? If you even think about  setting us up, giving us some bad  information? We go down... you go  down... Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards  are there gonna be? Hell. Ten? And which of these doors here lead  up to the security level? Start talking, Nick. Start talkin Who the hell made this map. What? I said, who the hell made the map? I did. This isn't the Tomahawk. What the fuck are you talking about. This is the front entrance, right?   You get through the slots, you hit  craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's  here to here -- lined up. What's  this, the cage? Cage is over there,  hard to get to, you got it all mixed  around -- That's what it looks like! Since when? What the hell is this  room? Buffet. Whaddya think it is? Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What  the hell kind of map is this?! We walked the place for a week. And I worked there. For a year. Map is kinda dirty, Monster... They changed the layout. What? They changed the layout -- whadda  they call you? Mr. Monster? They  remodeled the place. When I worked  there -- listen to me -- guy that  managed the joint, guy who ran it-- Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was  always talking bout fixing the place  up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta  gone and done it while I was in the  Mountain. I don't know this map, man. How the  hell am I supposed to tell you what  door goes where? They wouldn't have changed the  security setup. When I worked there, this was Bangs,  office. Back here. He kept a little  safe in the... uh, the wall, money  held take for himself, skim from the  Indians. Called it the... uh... ...the Powwow Safe. The Powwow Safe? His personal safe, he gave it a name.   Now you're telling me they've taken  his office, put the buffet there?   Then who knows what else they changed. So what the hell good are you... You'd have to get me inside. Get inside, watch where the money's  moving, see where the guards are  going. Then I could work with your  map. Wrong, convict. You walk in there,  they recognize you. So what? They recognize him, they'll remember  him after the job goes down. They won't recognize me. Why not. Trust me. They won't recognize me. We'll trust you when we're rich. Why  not. 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise. I give you the wrong information,  you're gonna shoot me. Well, I don't  know your damn map. So you can either  find a way to get me in there... or  you can shoot me right now. Bring back some memories, Nick? More than you know. What the hell is this? What happened  to working together? Rather be back in the Mountain? Might as well be. Don't have Weather Channel in the  Mountain, Nick. Sleep good, loverboy. Tomorrow you  got singing for your supper to do. Get your own room. But you knew why. Knew why, didn't  ya. For what? You to talk me into  "helping"? What, he promise you a  share of the winnings? Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at  least gotten that -- So get him outta your life. Get out  of Michigan. They got perfume counters  in Chicago, don't they? Since when do some trucker pals start  thinking big, anyway? He working for them on this one? And I'm his ticket. What's the last place they took down? Gabriel and his guys. What's the  last place they robbed? They've never done a robbery? Then they do need me, don't they.   They really need me... We? What "we"... Get your own room, Ashley. Get your own room. They've never done a robbery... Christmas is looking up. Having romance problems, Romeo? Not with you. Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of  the day you don't smoke? There anytime you don't got a mouthful  of shit? Cancer-sucker. Acid-chewer. Take a look what Pug's bought for  ya. A cowboy. You're going to send me  into an Indian casino disguised as a  cowboy. Have you thought this entirely  through? Put it on. You're a country-western singer up  from Nashville for the the holidays.  Visiting your Grandma on the lake,  driving into the Tomahawk for some  scotch and slots. You only play the  slots, you got that? Don't want no  dealer friend of yours recognizing  you, you sidle up to shoot some craps. What kind of half-ass cowboy plays  the slots? You do. At least gimme video poker. Shut the fuck up. You play what your  girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in  with you. You talk to her, otherwise  you don't talk to nobody. You walk  the room as many times as you want,  but the second you come out, I want  to know the run of the place. Do I get a country-western name? You get recognized, convict, You get  a country-western funeral. Y'know what, guys? I woke up this  morning, I got a really lucky feeling  going on. I mean it, I'm feeling  that good. I wouldn't be surprised  if I walk in there, pull a handle  and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't  even have to -- Get out. You got one hour. I'm gonna need some money. Ten dollars? What do I do with ten  dollars? Don't tip. Monster. If we're working together  here, we gotta be working together.  I can't walk in there looking like  the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten  bucks to throw down. You don't want  me getting noticed, right? Not getting  noticed costs a guy at least a couple  hundred. Don't. Lose. You ready to gamble, darlin'? Y'all take care of my guitar. Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel... Get in there and watch 'em. Watch  their every fuckin' move. There's an S-word I'd really like to  throw in the discussion here, guys,  cause it's a big part of what's going  on. Big element, 'kay? S-word. It's  a serious issue, serious factor, so  I'm just gonna get it out there,  throw it an out there, so we can  know it, we can talk about it, we  can get things done... Snow. Are you with me, guys? Snow.  Big time, fucking, grade-A, God- quality, S-N-O-W-snow. There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They  don't know it, they don't want it,  they got laws against the stuff.  They got Egypt down there, right,  they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they  got ancient Rome, but where's the  Winter Castle, right? Where's the  Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big  Fucking Igloo? We understand you, Mr. Bangs. Capades? They don't do it. Mittens?   Outlawed. Why? We're aware of your position. Because down there this is money.   Up here this is heat. You wanted Vegas quality, I brought  it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I  gave it to you. But guys, please,  guys... I can't get you Vegas  profits... till one of ya does some  spirit dance and does something about  this snow. We understand the Paiutes' casino  saw a net profit of twelve million  dollars last year. The Paiutes, they cook their books. The Waitela reservation made seventeen  million. Seventeen? Perhaps you have researched this,  Mr. Bangs. Is the snowfall on our  side of the lake that much greater  than the snowfall on theirs? I'm bringing in this great showroom  act next week; these three Russian  girls, they look like Meryl Streep,  they can juggle anything. Mr. Bangs. Guys. We're doing it right, here.  $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in  Michigan. Nobody. The tribe is concerned that many of  your... new ideas are not resulting  in any new venues. I'm putting liquor in the drinks,  I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I  got the girls showing sixteen-percent  more skin! Show me another buffet's  gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi!  Whaddya want me to do?! We want to see our casino making  money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money  for our community. Like the Paiutes and the Waitela. We want you doing the job... that we  brought you here to do. Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's  the main expansion. Tables've been  moved around; the big man's office,  I dunno, might be upstairs now. Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike. You start spending your brother's  money. I'm gonna take a circuit around  the joint, check for any new ins and  outs. I'll snag us some drinks. Couple rum and Cokes, please. You want that rum and Coke or rum  and Pepsi? Gimme a goddamn bottle of anything. I can't go back to Vegas, Bear.  They'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? I  can't go back... What does the tribe want? They want gold-paved roads is what  they want. Talking 'bout the fuckin'  Paiutes. Fuckin' Paiutes are on the  interstate. Nothing I can do about  that, man, I didn't pick the spot  for your reservation. Neither did we. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Hey. Hey, cowboy. Jack Bangs, I run  the place. Nice to have you in the  Tomahawk. Tell me something... ...does upstate Michigan need another  roadside casino or does upstate  Michigan need an international gaming  destination? Roadside casino? Well, so how'd you hear about this  place, then. Word-of-mouth? Mass  mailings? Cable TV? Prison. Prison?! I just stopped in to use the can. I can't go back to Vegas, Bear... I  can't... Aw fuck. What the hell was that about -- He didn't recognize me. Back off,  willya? He didn't recognize me. Heyyyy! There went my... damn... well, doesn't  seem like security's all that  switched... Ash, shit, this mustache  is starting to fall off. I gotta fix  this thing -- -- drink this for me. What happened? Hundred bucks to wear this jacket -- Jesus, man, don't kill me! Nobody's killing you, kid. Santa's  giving you a rhinestone jacket and a  hundred bucks. Thanks, sister. How are ya. Hell yeah. You work here long? How long ago was your makeover? No, the place. The remodeling. moving  everything around. GO! GO! Where the hell's he going? Where the hell's your sister? Get him! Oh man. It's your jacket, isn't it... Trouble. MEDIUM RARE?! You call this MEDIUM Where the HELL did he go? Monster. There never was a structure  change. This place was built the  same from day one. That motherfucker -- And Monster... he was talking with  the casino manager. Nick was talking  to him. Get. Him. Back. You keep running, Nick! Keep running  now! Can't keep warm if you don't  keep running! We'll just be right  back here... keeping track of your  trail. Wherever you run... we'll get there.  Fast as you want... we'll be there.   We drive for a living, Nick. Twelve,  fifteen, twenty-hour days. We got nothing but time. That's for reading her mail. Come on. We get to the bridge, we're all right! Get to the bridge! At the rate you're going, Nick...   I'm gonna have a hard time ever  considering you family. How lucky ya feeling now. I-I-I-I have n-n-no g-g-gifts to br- br-bring, pa rum-p-p-p-p-p ...pum-pum-pum. N-n-no treasures for  the k-k-k ...king. Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum. Game room's closed. A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for  effort and an honorary degree. I'm  surprised you never escaped from the  Mountain. ...never... tried... Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In  the spirit of the season, I'm going  to give you a chance. I understand  you're unhappy. Right outta the  lockup, here against your will, it's  the holidays and there's reruns on We're each going to get one of these.  Whichever one of us hits closer to  the bullseye... gets what he wants. You land closer, you get Ashley.   And you guys get to go free. I land  closer... and we start getting your  help. May the best sportsman win. Damn. Got something to say to me, Nick? ...ttt..tt... two out of three? What'd you tell that casino manager? Nnn... nothing... You were talking to him! What'd you  tell him!? Nothing... I promise-nothing... MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY? NO! He thought I was some gambler... he  didn't know me... he didn't recognize  me! I been driving rigs a long time,  Nick. Four, five million miles of  road. Worked for people who wouldn't  keep me on less I was driving fifteen  hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep,  I needed rest, shit, they'll hire  someone else... ...Dispatcher's screaming for me to  haul ass, he's got a load on the  runback for me. Shipper's making me  wait for the pickup, receiver's  bitching 'bout the count... ...Got the cops at the bottom of  every mountain, got the DOT at the  top. And every day, every day, I see  all those faces in their little airbag  Hot Wheels, moms and pops and jam- faced kiddies, giving me that look  to go to hell and get off their happy  goddamn highway. Hey. They don't  gotta get two thousand miles by  sundown, or the gang don't eat come  sunrise. It's time for me... to be working  for me. I want mine, Nick. And I  need you. Did you tell your manager there's  gonna be a robbery? No, Gabriel... no... ...he... he asked me... how I'd heard  about his place... he didn't know it  was me... I PROMISE YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS Man, Monster... just... just don't  start trying to hit me... Nick. I been trying to hit you. Maybe that'll help sharpen your  memory. Tonight we're gonna take another  look at that map. And this time you're  gonna tell me what I need to know. Pug. PUG! He had some points to make... All I wanted... was to make it home...  for a little of Dad's turkey, and  Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's  acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry  buns... ...Haven't had cranberry buns... in  five whole years... You saved me. Guy I was in with... car thief... I  used to read your letters to him. I  know they were private... I know,  but... you spend twenty-four hours a  day with somebody, you gotta talk,  y'know? You gotta share. Or the room  gets even smaller. And sometimes, I'd be reading them,  and he'd close his eyes, get a smile  on his face... and I'd know somewhere  inside he was pretending you were  writing to him -- He'd see your face,  your pictures on the wall... Some nights I think he fell in love  with you, too. You gave a couple guys hope, Ashley.   And with hope, there ain't nothing  you can't survive. Don't say my name... Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name. They'll have guns. You said they've run guns, in their  trucks. So they'll have guns. To do  this robbery. They'll have serious  guns. We'll need one. I'm going to have to be inside that  casino. When it happens. I'll need  to be part of it. I can't just be  drawing some map. We need to find a way to make me  part of it. If we're helping them with their  robbery, we're gonna be doing more  than just walking away. Like that's  some Christmas bonus. You want him outta your life? You  want a real New Year to look forward  to? If we're gonna do this... we're gonna  do it to get it all. Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten  packs a day like you. His lungs got  so black they couldn't find 'em with  an x-ray. That right? Shit. I used to run rigs  for a guy loved your chaw there.  Shit rotted out his tongue, had to  build him one outta silicon so the  poor boy could talk. You ever see a  motherfucker with a silicon fucking  tongue? Hell. The guy from Joliet, those  black-ass lungs were the least of  his problems. Got so much smoke in  him his lungs couldn't even hold it.  Got into his system, man. Into his  blood. Coming out his ears, man,  coming out his eyes. Guy'd be walking  the row, smoke'd be puffing out his  skin. This trucker? Met a girl in a bar  one night, she didn't know his  situation. He's drunk, she's drunk,  they get to mackin' hot and heavy  and the woman swallows it. His tongue.  Sucks it right down. My guy would walk into a room, set  off the goddamn sprinklers. His lips went next. You ever see  some silicon-fucking-lips? Vegetarians... Start singing. I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum Sing it in pictures, Nick. What you gotta worry about first is  the guards. Place doesn't look much  richer than when I worked there, so  let's figure you're gonna have to  deal with ten of 'em. There'll be  two on the floor, walking the room,  that leaves eight up above. Eyes in  the sky. They see something up,  they're the ones who'll hit the silent  alarm and you're fucked. How do we take them out? You gotta get someone upstairs. How do we do that? Across from blackjack, there's a  security doorway. Keypad access. What's the code? Uh... they change it every month. I  wouldn't know. If there's trouble on the floor,  you'll get security coming through.  what you gotta do, is get inside  that doorway once they do. You gotta  draw 'em out. Without having them hit the alarms. I got an idea on that one. Once you're  up there, you gotta hold those guards  down till some backup can get there.  There's a security camera room that  videotapes everything. You've gotta  destroy every last one of those tapes. What about the money? You lock down security, you move  behind the cage. You hit the Count  Room. There'll be a guy in there but  he's got no guns; room's accessed by  another code. Cashiers'll know it.  They'll have alarms. What about the Powwow Safe? What? The Powwow Safe. The secret safe.   You said the manager's got a safe in  his office where he hides skim money. Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs.  Uh. Here. Powwow Safe. So. You're gonna need a man through  here, two men at the cage, one to  cover the count. You're gonna need a  lookout outside, a sweeper through  the back, and a gun guarding the  front. You need six. We got five. Putting Ashley outside. You need six. NO. You go in with five, you're either  leaving an alarm free or an exit  free. Someone hits an alarm, you're  fucked. Someone gets to a phone,  gets outside, 'cross the street,  whatever, you're fucked. You need  six. Six is me. No. You guys get caught, I go away for  good. I got an interest in making  sure you don't. You need a sixth man  covering an exit. What're you gonna  do about it. I want a map of that security level.   Every room, every guard, every thing. Six men means six guns. No way. I'm no threat without a gun. No, you're not. There'll be people in that casino.   I can't keep them from leaving if I  don't get a gun. I don't need bullets,  Monster... but I gotta be a threat. No gun. Well. What you guys have to plan  out, then... is how you're going to  get to that cage and that security  level before anybody realizes  anything's wrong. Running in with  ski masks and bullets flying ain't  gonna do it. That part, Nick... was planned out  the day I read your letters. What. We all gonna dress up like  cowboys? Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys. Not on Christmas Eve. You gotta be kidding me. 'Tis the season, convict. Can't be attracting attention, right? What, we walking in there and  delivering toys? Hell yeah. I'm almost done. If he wanted a photographic memory,  he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working  on it here. You're the getaway girl. The money's  gonna get to you eventually. Gonna  be my job to be the guy who walks  outta there with it. But I can't do  that without a gun. Any luck talking  to him? Is there any way you could get into  his truck? We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun... Here's the Picasso. Is he in his  room? Keep 'em there for a little while. We're gonna get you out of Detroit,  Ash. Get you out of beauty and  fragrances. Remember that. After all this is  over, when you know me, when you  really know me... remember it was  me. Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta  be keeping a gun... He wants the money. ...whoever she is. All those letters are about to pay  off, baby... all those letters... Searching for a money man... -- till he fucked his parole -- That's a book, baby. That's a book of love. I can't take watching you touch him.   I can't take his hands on you. I've been doing good, though. Didn't have to send me down a fucking  mountain. He'll be dead when he does. Y'know something, baby? If you were  my sister? I'd still want to wake up  Christmas morning with you... Here's my present to you, truck  drivers -- Where the hell's Gabriel? With his girlfriend. Making up for  "Nick" time. I'm going down to the  bar, you want something? Get me a brew. I'm gonna check on  our convict. Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a  bike, it's like riding a bike! How far you gonna get, Rudy... My room. Hey. Hello, gentlemen. And how can we  help you on this holiday morning? Checking out. That's for the hundred bucks worth  of pay-per-view. And that's for the two hundred you  took outta your minibar. You guys were paying for the room, I  just figured -- You wanted a weapon, convict? You  got one. Merry Christmas-Eve. Commit this thing to memory. Every  guard, every exit... don't tape it  to your fuckin, wrist: remember it.  That's the Gospel right there. The  Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and  John... Okay, who had the cheeseburger with  bacon; what about a roast beef, I've  got two roast beefs here -- Cheeseburger 'n bacon's mine -- I got a bacon too; there another  bacon in there? I got a bacon for him and a bacon  for me; there's four cheeseburgers  and two roast beefs -- Somebody better give me something  with some goddamn bacon -- This time right now... Dad's stacking  wood out back, getting ready for  tomorrow. Little blaze in the  fireplace. Mom's setting out the  good silver, hanging her cinammon  sticks, up in the doorways. Getting  out her scratchy old records...  singing along... I don't know where you're going.   But I'm going home. Well. I'm going home. And all through the house... not a  creature was stirring... Why don't you go ahead and send most  of your guys home, Ed. Thanks, Jack. Merry X-mas. Hell. Nobody even comes here to  cheat... Go. Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you  something. You have any problem with  the fact that we're on our way to  take millions of dollars from an  Indian casino? Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's  gone a long way toward restoring  wealth and pride to communities who've  been economically isolated and  enslaved for centuries. Stronger  infrastructure, better schools, higher  employment... they're all the results  of reservation casino success stories.  Still, many natives believe that  these are temples to a godless  materialism and greed that will only  infect the souls of indigenous peoples  until their love of money has  destroyed the spiritual values their  ancestors died to protect and their  homelands have become no different  from any United States suburb,  satellite city or industrial park.   Destroying the Indian legacy once  and for all and leaving behind a  nation of selfish, angry natives, of  which I, it's true, am one -- Hey-hey, egg nog for everybody! Let's win some MONEY! MONEY-MONEY- How you gentlemen doing tonight? We're out of work tonight, that's  how! Christmas Eve! We're out of  work! Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's  with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas  the season... We're all outta gifts, boys and girls,  but we got charitable donations! ...bunch of us got together for the  union party. Hey, how late are you  open? All night and all day. I got wampum for the Cocktail Waitress  Civil Defense Fund! Are there any  representatives here present? Santa drinks American beer. What's your game, guys? Blackjack. Got a buddy from  Woolworth's out parking the sleigh. Good luck, gentlemen. Woolworth's! Hey, Sears! Hey, Wal-Mart! Saved you a seat, man. Get in on a  hand here! Careful. Watch out for this guy. American beer. POP! That was My card! But... I had a five... You're hitting for MY cards! Could Fat-Man-With-Flying-Horse get  some quarters, please? Be back, Wal-Mart. Watch my bank. That is my card, guy. My card. He hit, mister. He didn't hit. You didn't hit. You're not hitting. But you don't even know what it is! There's two more coming. Hell, there we go. That's the spirit. Jack? Is there a union for department  store Santas? Switch seats with me. What? No... You're taking my money. Switch seats  with me. Switch seats with me if  you're not taking my money -- I'm ninety-two years old -- Then get yourself another table!   You're hitting Santa's cards and  you're taking Santa's money! There is no other table -- THEY'LL OPEN ONE! Stay down, pop! Trust me, stay down! Help them down there! HELP them! Video room, video room -- Map said video room -- Map said goddamn video room! WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON??!!! Step BACK from the desks! DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!! Hold it right there, Nick. Your squirt  gun's all you need. Cover 'em. Sorry, guys. But what the hell were  you doing here an Christmas Eve  anyway. No... not here... please... mister... Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm  begging. This is not some card club,  'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an  international gaming destination.  We're in guidebooks. You can't do  this... you can't do this to me... Show's over. Get down and stay down, and you're  gonna be fine. Just don't do anything.  My friends are disturbed -- What's the security code to the Count  Room? Security code? What security code?   You just use a key! NICK SAID SECURITY CODE! Who's Nick?! You said no GUNS in there! NO GUNS! DROP IT! DROP THE GUNS! Yeah. That's love. You knew there were guns in here! Merlin, I didn't know -- You got Pug killed! You tried to get  ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free -- I promise you, I didn't know! Santa Claus, Santa Claus, and Santa  Claus... would you please bring our...  mapmaker... to the security level? I can't go back to Vegas... I can't...  go back... What the hell is with this place?   Thought the video room was back there -- I told you not to fuck us with that  map, Nick. I told you not to, and  you did. How am I s'posed to keep my  promises now? How's she s'posed to keep hers? He won't tell us where it is. The  Powwow Safe. I don't know... what you're... THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW What... Powwow... The Powwow Safe where you steal your  money! Where you cheat your Indians! I don't steal any -- We KNOW about the Powwow Safe! We  KNOW it's in here! We KNOW how you  work! Because WE know who's worked  for you! Remember a guy named Nick Mason!?  A  security guard named Nick Mason!? Nick... Mason... ? ...so where is he? Where is he?! Where is he?! He's not Nick Mason... Nick Mason... worked for me two years  ago. This man... ...he's some cowboy... Fucked the wrong guy, Ashley. Story of your life. I did time with Nick Mason, Monster.   Told you that from the start. We still gonna spend Christmas  together? You are lucky, convict. You're  spending Christmas with the birthday  boy himself -- Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE! I did time with Nick Mason, remember?   I knew he worked here, didn't I!?   Well, some shit he told me! Nick told me his manager kept a safe  in his office, his stealing safe.  His Powwow Safe. I swear, please...   Nick told me. Behind the liquor cabinet. Open it. I can't go back to Vegas... OPEN IT!!! Pow. Wow. VEEEEGGGGAAAASSSS!!! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! GO!!! Hell. I'm gonna take pleasure in  this... Me too. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. I'm sorry. That's why they call it gambling. With the wrong fucking guy! We took  the place down with the wrong fucking  guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is  that Christmas?! God bless us every one... You almost got away with it, Santa.  Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your  car, got halfway to Canada till you  caught some ice in the road. By the  time you hit bottom down there, whole  car was burning like a comet.  Musta  burned up all that money too. Buncha guys in red suits busted in,  they'll say. Started shooting. They  won't be able to remember... if it  was three, or four... or five. Four  dead Santas and some burned-up cash.  Merry Christmas, The End. Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it  hers. She told me 'bout the convict  magazines. Had to figure there'd be  some boys in the pen with some useful  knowledge. With nobody to talk to.  Nobody to listen. So we stocked up  on stationery. Hard life being a trucker's girl. I saved your life. He did love you, you know. Nick. He  did love you. Maybe this is where you wanted him,  Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine,  dead as ice with a burnt-up heart.  Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause  what you did for him was make him  the happiest held ever been. You  showed him hope and taught him mercy.   And he died a peaceful man. You wanted  to destroy some convict... and all  you did was save his soul. Remember  that. Love your money and remember  that. I'm glad it was me. Get in the car. Get in the CAR! How'd you know my name... Rudy. How'd you know my name? You said Merry Christmas, Rudy. No -- But I never said Rudy. I never told you my name. Ash? How'd you know my name was Rudy. Ash? How'd you know my name. Where is he. Merry Christmas, Rudy. I missed you, beautiful. Oh, hey. Have you two been properly  introduced? Sweetness, this is Rudy  Duncan, I did almost a year with him  in the Mountain. Read him all your  letters, talked about you all the  time, made him feel like he really  knew you. My friend... wantcha to meet Millie  Bobek. 'Member Millie Bobek, dontcha?  My girlfriend fore I went in? Worked  at that bar in Motor City, where I  manslaughtered that guy? Hell. Didn't  talk about her much once the Ashley  letters started coming, I guess. Millie here used to serve drinks to  these gunrunning truckers, real big  talkers, talking bout a real score  one day. I was in the Mountain, man,  what the hell, why not let her get  friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em  an idea she had, 'bout writing guys  in prison. Getting one who could  show 'em a sure thing. She set them up. All of them. Why not have her pretend to find me?   Pretend to write me and reel me in?   Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose  as some sister of his named Ashley? And you set me up. Always wanted to rob that casino,  Rudy. Way back when I worked there.   What better way than to get some  guys to rob it for me. Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the  shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does  he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty  to put out the story I was dead.  Once the wound healed up... Got out of the Mountain this morning.   And tonight I'm a rich man. How'd you know I'd do it. Do what? Walk outta there and tell her I was  you. Because every time I read her letters,  Rudy... you listened. Keep your gun on him. Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk,  Rudy. That's what the witnesses'll  say. So we gotta have five Santas  not walk out. Gotta have five... This'll burn right away... in the  fire... Hell, you never needed to convince  Ashley you were me. Just the dumb  fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked  enough about the Tomahawk in the pen  for you to get by -- Talked about the old man's weapons  stash, probably forgot I'd remember Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if  you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd  start convincing 'em soon enough. They had the weapons and the  willpower. We just gave them their  inside man. You gave them me. I gave them me. Said some nice things about me, Rudy.  I appreciate it. But don't worry. I  do love her. And she loves me. You  had that right all along. Sweetness! Let's light up the tree! Goodbye, Rudy! Nice spending time  with you! LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A RULE ONE! NEVER PUT A CAR THIEF BEHIND RULE TWO! ...Rudy... help me... Rudy... ...Rudy! Rudy! HELP ME!!! Son? Is... is that you...?
