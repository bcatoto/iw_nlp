Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right? Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life? Jesus, man ... What'd you do? Yeah -- ? Me, too. Every time I walk... No, but you dress like an asshole ... I do ... Christ, what happened to us ? I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ... And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood. We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ... The business has changed... Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ... Who do you think? The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense. Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you - A boost. A big boost ... He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad... Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ... It's been a long time, Memphis -- About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in -- Is there someplace we can talk? Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ... Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ... Well, that certainly won't do. I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ... But I had to. It was the only way to get to you -- Right there - Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ... I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ... One more night -- Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ... This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop? "don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things... Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ... I knew you'd say that, too -- I knew you'd say that. They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ... Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled... Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ... My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best. Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them... Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip. Yes ... Kip ... Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ... frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ... Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at. How is he? Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ... You betcha -- I'll catch you later, Randall -- I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ... I know you. Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ... Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ... Your girl works in there ... It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ... Something like that - What are you still doing here, Randall? I know you. I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ... Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ... Or your baby brother. What was his name? I hope it's not your dear sweet mother... I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused... I know you. Get out of here, then. Now. I don't golf... You'll leave -- ? How's that? Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce -- You want to come along quiet? I know you -- Right ... Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ... Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ... What's wrong with it -- ? What's this -- ? Castlebeck.What for? He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us... They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ... By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ... You seem a little hinked-up ... Where you been, anyway? What for? When'd you get to town, Raines?Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today? Donny-nothin'! No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car! Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy... We're partners here -- So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ? Yeah? What's the matter? That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ... Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ? Good. It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ? You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles. You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing - Well, that defies the point, don't it? How'd it go? Jonathan Quayle Higgins ... What color? For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO... What about him? You guys have any skills at all? Lookit Kip. All grown up... I miss Orville Redenbacher already -- It's arright ... Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn." Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ? We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live... Most of 'em are late-model... Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ? All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ? Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ... I think so too -- Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit.. That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis? Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded. There's no one left ... Yeah... A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man -- Donny -- You mean the poor -- You ever feel bad about any of this? C'mon, man ... It's all microchips and shit ... Yeah. Diane 1. Got it ... okay ... I guess ... What's that? It just ain't happening -- Keys were in it ... Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.? How you know that? We don't -- ? What does that mean -- ? Any word, Kip -- ? How are we supposed to-- The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ... Breakfast brunch -- ? Oh, for God's sake NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man. I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.No. That was Higgins .... Gray. Peugot convertible ... Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ... Hey, Donny -- Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ... Remember who my brother is? That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving It ain't what you'd call a "good sign" No ... And they won't take my calls ... Pop the trunk. I need my tool ... He didn't mess up. There it is ... We'll take it. We'll take it... Whatcha got left ... ? Any more, O -- ? Just hold on... Hold on ... No... Any more ... Don't go there, Toby -- Damn crooks is everywhere -- You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it? How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ? Yeah... You want a ride... What do you say, Toby?, Where you off to -- ? You want me to buy her? Sure, man -- I dunno ... I keep thinking about him. Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn. Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one -- I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ... Toby... Toby... I've missed you, man ... What? What? I don't know. What -- ? I dunno. Whatever will be will be... Nah. I'm cool. Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ... I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ... It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis. You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?" Price of doing business... The era when crime didn't pay -- Maybe not. But Dad was from another era... The family that steals together, deals together... De nada ... After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ... Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ... Shadow games ... You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ... I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand... I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ... Otto called - Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ... Me... Me. I can handle it -- I can handle it -- I can handle it -- Hey, now - C'mon, man... My "demise..." Overreaction What? About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ... About what? Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking -- Hey, you want something to eat ? Nah. It's a scratch. You're kind of cultivating a new look. I heard you were pumping gas - Cool. So you're living up North? Yeah, man. Where is your beer? Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ? All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww... This has nothing to do with any of that -- I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it - Yeah ... It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look - Hello, Memphis -- Hospital. Shit ... Now, we go - I gotta get my tool -- Pop the trunk, Tumbler. But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here... No problem -Point-five ... My version of "take this job and shove it..." Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ... I think about that night a lot... Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce You have a Hollandaise sauce ? Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke." Fish. What's with the fish thing -- ? Jesus ... Who was the job for? Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley... It seems she neglected to mention it A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost? What kind of job... ? Tell me about Kip - Six years ... What about? What are you doing here? How's the leg? You got no choice. It's over. What do you mean -- ? Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him... You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ... This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ? Get out -- Get out of here, Ray -- Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ... I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em... And if he doesn't make it -- ? Sound it out for me. I'm just here about my brother. I'm not interested -- They gave you only four days? I can come up with the front money. Pay you back... I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ... I don't want him hurt... It's about my brother ... Kip... How ya doing? Double-meaning intended -- Consider me gone, Detective -- You know my back. What do you want from me? Not my girl anymore I'm on the move - I don't think so, Detective ... You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ? Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello. You know my back. And this has what to do with me? Kip. No... A little family emergency -- You know my back. You have my word... You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially... Let them go. And I'll leave ... Let them go -- How's Atley -- ? You know my back - Not at all ... Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ... No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ... The other day.... Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart... How's it going -- ? And there she is -- I know. Weird, huh -- ? That's right. Only 10 exotics ... Forget that ... You know where the others are? How you doing, man? We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all You remember that, Kip? Mother -- ! Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership... Imagine us selling cars? You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died? What time of year? He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ... You getting my checks ... ? He's in some trouble ... Why didn't you tell me? Atley Jackson came to see me ... No. How's Kip? You, too, Ma... Thought I'd go for a ride - Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ... You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ? You okay -- ? Move over ... You boost her -- ? Where'd you find this one? What are you doing here? I know ... I know. I've missed you, too Come here - Come here - Come here -- What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you? That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ... That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you... Too early to tell. Nervous? You okay -- ? Having fun, Kip? What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ? As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher? What era was that -- ? Dad'd be proud -- Ain't we good-timing here ... ? Thank-you ... How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...? You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail. "Shadow games?" You hear me? We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean What are you doing here? You don't think so, huh? You? You? You can handle it? You can handle it? He's gonna kill you -- ! "Over--" You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron-- You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ... What happened to you? I can see that - "About what?" So what are you gonna do? There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive - What do you got ... ? Okay -- Yeah -- Something like that - Yeah - You sure you're okay -- ? Sure -- You okay -- ? Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there... Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ? Just hold-on there -- You all right -- ? Kip -- ? You, too Hey, Kip ... DO IT! NOW -- ! Call 911 - How's it going? Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES. We're going shopping -- ! Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans -- Take it back, Freb -- Yeah. He's knows of one all right. He give you an advance -- ? Bench seats. She does have one thing you don't. What -- ? Oh, yeah. For real, point-five. I dunno. I know a place. Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride? Yeah ... You -- ? Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go -- They got him to the hospital. He's stable ... Donny got shot ... A jacker ... And Tracy's on the move ... I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up. Let me worry about The Club ... Hear you roar ... With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ... I ratchet your ignition mechanism ... Now... I'm in ... I do ... I cut "em... I pop your hood; find your siren wires The alarms go off ... Unlock your button ... Slip it in ... I take out my slim-jim... Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness. I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good -- C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ? Her parole officer strongly recommended it ... No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look... Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses? A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ... No. Open her ... Ready -- ? Oh. Okay. Right. No ... No way ... Very good... I always thought you'd follow me up. Okay. That what you want? I put the boys on it. They're clever that way... They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area... Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself What's wrong with her -- ? That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway." If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ... I understand - Six or seven... Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared. Kip's in trouble And here I am... I left town. I didn't leave you. I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ? On account of Mitch? So I was replaced by Mitch? "Mitch?" Buy you a drink? You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's? The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old... See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea -- I'll see you soon -- What happened to Sway? Split it up. Any word on Donny? Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ... Okay, then... Otto? His criminal career has officially come to a close ... No we don't - If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield? And the moral of that story is -- ? I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me Is he still working here ? The hard part ... Tell me... You think it can be done? He's gotten involved -- The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars? The rolled-back odometers? The part bins? Of course. Hi, Junie -- Hello, Otto ... You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up... Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions? Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ... You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ... So what's in there -- ? She soars - She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ... All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ... The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500. This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now. How old are you now, Toby? Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up Excuse me -- Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ? You have any other answers besides "not really"? There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ? You know what you got here?Call 'em here -- ? It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ... For real? Where we going -- ? Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man - You know of one -- ? Hell, yeah. Ten larger manDouble-meaning intended, right? No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...? Needs brightening ... Cadillac. Who is it -- ? That's a good one, Donny... Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO... one minute -- ! We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ... We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew... Dignity... It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx... "Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ... You guys are through... Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now... She left... He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit. Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ? Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis? In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And... The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be. I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days... You need him... Some crew you got ... Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh... I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ... The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular - "A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that. It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew... Are you considering a comeback tour? I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ... What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to... Whatever do you mean? You remember Junie? Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell? And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?You've been pre-booked... Yes, sir - I know, sir ... okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ... Yes. can you hold, sir -- ? D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you? Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ... What am I supposed to do? I dunno ... It looks just like a regular Mustang -- I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back... Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette. Sure - You goin' home? I'm cool - Hey, Kip, what's up? No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen? You sure I can't go with ya? Come on. Kip, talk to the guy How come ... ? What about me? I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"... I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want. So she flies - Why do you call it "Eleanor?" Who's "Eleanor?" Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ... Yeah, I'm cool ... Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ... Which way's out, man -- ? Checkin' it out I known Kip longing than you, man ... Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --Uh ... Randall -- ? Not -- Not really -- Not really -We can't do that, dude -- What are we gonna do -- ? Run it... Now what -- ? What for -- ? Things are all leafy and suburban ... Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ... Shit all looks the same here -- What are you doing here, assface? Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck -- Why don't you leave him alone? What do you want, shithead?
