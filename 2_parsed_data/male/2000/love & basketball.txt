You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential? When I ignore you, that's when you worry. Go get dressed. What? You want the job or not? We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again. You could've given up after you threw that ball away. But you kept your head and you showed real heart. I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me? Dora, take her spot. You love to pose so much, let's see it again. This time get your feet set.Shh. It's okay. Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself... That was nice. Then I'll get you some punch. I mean, I'm having a good time with you... That was two words. Careful. I'm an English major. You like English? No, I mean I can check it for you. Can I take your coat?But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did. You could make a career by telling me where. Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.Thanks, sweetheart. You sure? Which one for tomorrow? Camille, she'll be fine. She's alright. I'll take that as a compliment. So how's the job going? I was upstairs for a meeting. I've been hearing good things about you. Hey, munchkin. I know. But chances are... You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited. Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality. Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball. You lost your head. And what am I supposed to say to the man?A horse? I don't know sometimes. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what? You might be the only one with a job. Nah. So how long is this trip? I don't wanna see that. Damn, girl. It means a lot that you came by. Kyra, this is Monica. She, uh... It's okay. And what happens when you lose? So? What will this prove? Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay. I mean, I was lost. So you are forgiven. But that was five years ago. I moved on. What's that supposed to be, psychology? You're out of your mind. For what? What? Wrong. Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married. You haven't changed. You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass. Well, guess what, it doesn't. We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this? I heard enough. you woke me up to tell me that? What? What's going on? Find. What? Cause I don't get it. So why'd you give up ball? I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet. She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking. Maybe go back to school. Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him. Now, I kinda think I need to try something else. Nah. I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months. Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that... That a nice way of saying I rode the bench? Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too. Yeah. Two weeks. I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you... Getting there. Darryl. He's alright, kinda corny. Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured I'd keep Mom company. Thanks. No. A rest? What do you mean? Figured it was something like that. Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American. And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again. Tried calling you a couple times. Funny. I never did. Still working on being the first girl in the NBA? So, how's pro-ball, Europe? Not for Quincy McCall. A lot of things. All I know is I'll be back in six months. Yup. I'm alright. But you can sit. Thanks. Just something I'm trying. Alright. I heard you were in Spain. So...I guess I'll see you around. Damnitt, Monica. This ain't about us anymore, it's about me. Few days ago. I decided to go pro. And who knows where I'll end up, you know? Look, I'm entering the draft. I don't think so. I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for. I'm not asking for us to be together. Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me? Go fuck Dick Vitale. Never had to. Least you got your priorities straight. Stay! You forgot to be there. I just said I didn't fuck around. But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me. Least she had time for me. I just took the ho to Burger King, alright. Can we talk? We're going to get some food. Oh, Kerry, this is Monica. Monica, Kerry. The "man" again. Yeah, sorry about that. I had this meeting with this guy. Hey, what's up. Nah. I have curfew. You know what, I'm just gonna crash. Not really. Look, this party's whack. You ready to go? Nobody. You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball? It happens, right... Here I am. What's up? For real. I should be alone, anyway. Nah. Don't sweat it. Didn't realize you were watching the clock. Why not? I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright? I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this... He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers." Man, how stupid am I. What has he been to me? I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing. Like it was easy. And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense... Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something... I wanted you to. Right here. Plan to. My court, I go first. Clothes. So how about a little one-on-one? Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA. You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway. So you're gonna act salty all night? Then prove her wrong. Forget Tonya Randall. It's okay, little baby. I can't help girls coming up to me. I can't be nice to a fan? What? Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all. Yeah. What was that about? You sure? When'd you get this? You had four offensive rebounds. Four. Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything. That what you think? None of your business. Figures. I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all. Guess not. Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. So who is this clown? You having fun? Hey. You don't look half-bad. See you made it. I don't. With a jacked-up attitude. I'm warning you. You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you. I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head. That's it, give it your best shot. God, here we go. Your hot-ass temper. See, that's why you ain't getting recruited. So who you going to the dance with, Spalding? Didn't know you cared so much. So she's honest. And? Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me. Big-ass titties? What's that? Guess "please" would be a stretch. Your legs don't look broke. I know this. What do you want? Shut up! What? Man, forget you then, stupid. So that means I have to ride with you. My Dad always drives my Mom. Five seconds. I think we gotta kiss now. Kay. Oh. I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together. And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers. She don't know how to box, I bet. My dad showed me how to fight like Ali. Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street. You do act different. I don't know. A lot. He's alright, but my Dad can take him. My Dad plays for the "Clippers." He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too. Same number and everything. Your Dad play? I never knew a girl that could play. So how come you could play basketball? For real? So...does it hurt? I'ma be in the NBA. You're gonna be my cheerleader. Lucky. So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's? He wouldn't lie. I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's? This is just about money, you know that. Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family. Don't sweat it, okay. Sooner or later the truth'll come out. Sorry. You okay? I don't know, he had a meeting or something. Said he'd be home later. Yup. Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated. I've been hearing you. Okay. We were just studying. What are you doing in my room? Uh, your earring? We still have to go? Yeah. And now I'm paying for it, right? That what this is about? "I told you so?" Good. I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget? Look, I'm busy. After five years. What do you want? Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary. From your mouth. Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you. I'm dropping out of school and going pro. So now you're saying my mother trapped you? I ain't a damn liar. And some things should never fucking happen! Lucky kid. We ain't got nothing to talk about. Still is, so let yourself out. What are you doing here? What's Mom think? Why? So what are you gonna do? Sorry. I mean, it's not true, is it? Tell me what? What? What mess? Okay... You came out early. I'm also good enough to go pro. You know, people. You work too hard, Pop. You don't wanna hurt your back. Yeah? So you up for a game later? Didn't we already have this conversation? Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way. Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man. "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.I'd love for him to get a good education. That's it. Gotta wait til the press conference. Don't go starting rumors, Jim. My son's college bound with or without basketball. Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that. How you been? Nona, please. What's that, not great? Keep your voice down. No, you said I should get my degree. I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold. I have. Yeah. I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude. I had some players to see and hands to shake. Nona, don't start bitching. I got maybe two years left to play. I'm just trying to put some things together for us. Business folks. Just you and Quincy, baby. I got a meeting. What? Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit." Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something. You want me to fuck off? Quincy. I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me. No. I can see that. I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself. Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom. Came by to check on you. I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this. What? I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man. But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel. And another twenty that made it past security on your floor. And the boldest one is standing right at your door. And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game. I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have. But I did it cause I love you. Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage. Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me? Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen. I messed up, okay, I know that. But I ain't that kid's father. We need to talk. Your door was unlocked. We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years. Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart. We'll just have to see how it plays out. I'm giving her some space, couple days... A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips." This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me. I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle. No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it. It's not true. I just told you. Some girl that's been hanging on at every party. now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy. Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you. there's this thing out there. This paternity suit. Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with. Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices. You don't have a choice. You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA? Give yourself time to develop, Quincy. Get an education. The NBA ain't going nowhere. Well, tell them to mind their damn business. You're smart enough to get a degree. What people? Let's hope I can say the same about you one day. Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late. I don't wanna hurt your feelings. I don't care about the team. I care about the school. That's right. Why not? Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
