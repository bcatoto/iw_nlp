My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor. I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels? It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile. I'm pleased to have the new post, sir."...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..." "With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --" "One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..." At your service, Count. I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow! Marquis? Is that you?If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself -- Don't come back, not tonight, not again -- Go back to your room. Quickly. They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn. Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice. By whom? The Marquis? "Turn you out?" Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here. Is that a promise you can truly keep? The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court -- In part, yes. Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan? But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence? But why must you indulge in his pornography? Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read. Not now, or we're both done for. Has he hurt you? The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead. Madeleine -- We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption. You'd deny a dying man his salvation? I must grant him his last rites. Free his mouth. You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more. Of course. I'm here. Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue. We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin. Then it must've been love -- Was it impotence? Why was it you never took her by force? You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged. AND DID YOU? I know, because I felt it myself -- -- the passion in your heart -- I saw the longing in your eye -- It's no secret that you loved her. An innocent child is dead. Your words drove Bouchon to -- Your wig. Remove your wig. NOW STRIP. I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS! OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES! You expect me to pimp Madeleine? What on earth would that require? What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked! If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive. Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification -- Because your writing continues, unchecked. -- and your meat shall be de-boned. Orvolle. His wine. From now on, nothing but water at every meal -- Valcour. His chair. His rug. Good day, Marquis. That's enough. I don't know who you insult more; her or me. You always do. Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them. You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur. Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written. Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur. Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior -- If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice. How can one man possibly be so selfish? You mean to take us all down with you? If you only mean to dupe me again -- Do I have your word? You among them? Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves -- Our future lies in the stroke of your pen. More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure. One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties! But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast? But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well? And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature! It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" -- Enough to discern its tenor. But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction! What did you do? Bribe one of the guards? Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life. I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption. In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters. We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich -- It's not even noon -- I've stared into the face of evil... ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down. No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again. I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last. Poorly. And my own. I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it. As you say, Doctor. If only blood will appease you, then shed mine. Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine. It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children -- You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force. I'll do everything in my power -- That's not our intent -- It was not inspired by circumstance. It was fiction, of course. Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife -- I have. He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend -- He's sworn to obedience. I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here. Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now -- On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself -- A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent. Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward? But he's one among some two hundred wards -- Shut down? Yes? I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them. You have to believe me, I had no idea -- For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable. It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind. Oh. That. He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards -- Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises -- A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture. Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one. His wife's influence. He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value. I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation. A few indiscretions in his youth. If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs? You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain. Of course. Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --Sweet, then? Like the pastry? Maybe someday you'll tell me your name. I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold. Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.You'd do that, rather than forsake our love? "By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..." "...your wife."Yes? But I am history. As for the author... shoot him. Enough!We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion. Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution. Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory. They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide. -- and the listless ones do the binding. I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note -- Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas. Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves -- Will you sleep soundly tonight? And you? It must've been an ordeal. How is the patient faring? My, my. You have exceeded my expectations. HER NAME, ABBE. Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name... He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes? You'd suffer in her stead? This child let loose the beast from its cage -- He'll do no such thing. What could cause a tincture like this? Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum. -- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse -- You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain -- No. It most certainly was not. Of course. Oh indeed? -- then I've friends of my own to visit. You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here -- And --? Well? And place my reputation at stake? You find this amusing, do you? You're a sentimental man. Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake? In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here. Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor. Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions. All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it? Do you favor its publication? Well...? And his writing? What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche? And he's never once attempted escape? His wife's? Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison? Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure. Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax -- I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction. It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy. I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things. It's a formality; truly. This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood? I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben�; I look to the future. Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delben�? Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not? I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben�. Mine is a higher mission. But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment. It's libelous; you wouldn't dare. You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed -- I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use. This is neither the time nor the place -- Good God, Marquise -- Of course. And I in yours. Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride. -- words alone are insufficient. If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity -- That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation. What a beautiful thought, Marquise. But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books? Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them... That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves. You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton... I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf. With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband. Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix? I pray you: be succinct. My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics. It is customary to write first, and request an appointment -- You prefer a book to your husband's company? I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire. Doesn't that please you? Do as I say. Leave at once --No. But tell him I would. Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart. Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers. I'd rather read, thank-you. Very much. But it's just begun --"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --" "With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --" "One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..." Now give the signal. Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones. For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes? Surely you'll grant me a final word. Abbe de Coulmier! I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed? I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE -- NEVER! Who's to say I did not? Go to hell! IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK. I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL! Don't confuse one organ with another -- -- that was lust -- Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog -- So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not? For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not! Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I? It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man. Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape! Coulmier, you animal! I wasn't talking about Madeleine. A night spent with the partner of my choice. I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily. A man after my own heart... Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe. I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT! WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE? -- water! -- Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron! That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime -- And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass -- My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death? THEN BUGGER ME! You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw. "Part the gates of heaven," as it were -- Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit -- I have a proposition. I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create -- That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me. You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper -- What the devil -- We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw. He can't do that to me. Don't be absurd; it's only a play. Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine? You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill. Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended. Mightier than the sword indeed. They can't be serious. It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he? I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine. It's a fiction, not a moral treatise. I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die. There I was taxed; it's true. And --? Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages? But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness -- Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small -- I'll fill page after page, I promise. Don't be so sure. I'm entertaining you now, aren't I? It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink. I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you? Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated. Care for a splash of wine, Abbe? "What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?" Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air... Yes! You shall. Of course you shall -- -- who'll whisper it to Bouchon -- Go on, child. How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air? First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it. Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream -- You're far crueler than I, my sweet. Surely you've seen a man naked. They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one. My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe... Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door... The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium. The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap. The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am... A kiss for each page. Fiendishly so. Most assuredly. The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane. I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings.... You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator... If only these coins purchased your other talents, too. The peril of composing such incendiary prose... It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake. Did I frighten you? Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole... I'm hungry for a proper visit. It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU? Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor -- It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it? They've put you up to this, haven't they? You've come to lecture me? How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE? For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink? Hm? Tell me. What other treats?I don't take my orders from you; not anymore. Mustn't do that, sir. They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
