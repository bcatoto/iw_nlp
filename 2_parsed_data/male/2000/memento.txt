And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say. Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop. I know you said you didn't want any calls... Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk. Hi, Leonard. Leonard. Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway. Just two. So far. You're still paying for it. It's still Your room. Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room. Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this. This was your room. You're up in 304 now. No, let's go. This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up. Shit. Wrong room. Hi, Leonard. Seen you together, that's all. As requested. Couple days. That must suck. All... backwards. What's it like? Amnesia? Condition? You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember? You don't know? Burt. What can I do for you, Leonard? Hiya.I just want you to tell me how you came by that car. Where'd you get it? I like your car. I haven't made a strong enough impression. You did. What?Take the money and walk away! Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it! Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing? Why? I knew I couldn't trust that fuck - You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want - Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy? Yeah, I remember you. What the fuck are you doing here?No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something. That's it. Just loud enough to wake me up. It's simple, you just go to the bathroom. I'm not too good on the phone. I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them. A cop? That's right I did, didn't I? Yeah? I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key. You don't have to be that honest, Burt. Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me. So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump? Why didn't you clean it out? Why? When was I in here? Then why is this my handwriting? This isn't my room? What? I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key. He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay? What makes you think he's my friend? So you're holding my calls? How long have I been here? Like waking. Like you always just woke up. My wife. No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably... I have no memory. That's the thing. I have this condition. I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone. Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls - MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 I'm sorry... um... ? I'm Mr. Shelby from 304. I forget. Interested in buying one? Thanks. Don't be too hard on yourself. Who did this to you? I don't want your fucking money! You think you can bargain with me?! Strip! I don't want blood on them. Quiet! Don't say anything else. You Jimmy Grantz? Do you remember me? Jimmy? I can't make new memories. Everything fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before. I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know. My name's Leonard. Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss. Who's your boyfriend? How do you know about me? I don't remember. See, I have no short-term memory. It's not amnesia - Oh. But haven't we met before? I'm meeting someone called Natalie. There's a dress code? A BEER, please. Beer, please. I remember my wife dying. Dying. My wife. Thanks. Thank you. John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage. They're not looking for him. Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this - Don't say another fucking word! Shut the fuck up! Yes. Just take it easy, this isn't my fault. Calm down. Don't talk about my wife. That's different. What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money. What? How? I'm not. Neither do I. What happened? I have this condition - What's this all about? Did you? What does he want? Who? What's wrong? Why would you do that? Me? Why would he be interested in me? Yeah, I hated it. My wife used to call me Lenny. Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy. I'll go see him. Where is he? And what did he say? Who? Kill him. What do the police think? Who did he go to meet? What happened? It's not easy to be calm when - She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes. I know the feel of the world. I know how this wood will sound when I knock. I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up. Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much. I know the feel of the world, and I know her. There are things you know for sure. Course not. What? Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy. So I just take your word? How do I know he did that to you? That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?! Who is he? What have you got me into? Yeah. You? Don't remember. Sorry. Sounds perfect? What do I owe you? Deals? She was beautiful. Perfect to me - Why? So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo. The world doesn't disappear when you close your eyes, does it? My actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. My wife deserves vengeance, and it doesn't make any difference whether I know about it. Then you shouldn't have to ask. Have I told you what this man did? You know him? Yes. So you have information for me? Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny. Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition - She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her. I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories. Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me? Then why are you here? We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal. Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown - Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next - You've read it a hundred times. How can you read that again? It is now. I should kill you. Your name's Teddy. Why would I do that? You probably. So who are you saying he was? Why do you keep lying to me? When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different! Somehow, I'll know! Yes, I will. It makes all the difference. But he's not the right guy! She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong with you? My wife wasn't diabetic. I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and - I never said he was faking! I never said that! Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - ! That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy - What the fuck are you talking about? He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy? This is a drug deal?! I don't know. See, I have this condition. Maybe. Maybe just. He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you? There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor! You're not coming? How do you know him? How do you know this? Envelopes? Why not? Why? How'd you know I was in here? Yeah, well, thanks for the advice. I didn't sell - Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran - My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered. I have money. Like what? What sort of questions? Why? Happy now? Why are you following me? Why not? MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you? From who? What do you mean "bad news"? Why's that? Who's she? Unfinished business. Prove it. Who the fuck are you? I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about. What's wrong with this one? Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him. I'll ride with him. You follow. Shut it, Teddy. It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun. I don't know. We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding. We've got to get him out of here. Why? No. No, just let me think for a minute. I might have fallen asleep before I did. I don't think so. You don't know him? Why are you here? Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key. Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have. He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live. Why? Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay? Why? Who? It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis? It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts. Guess I've told you about my condition. Things change. Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back? I'll be waiting. John Gammell? Mr Gammell? I don't remember. You know it? You're in a playful mood. I guess I've told you about my condition. Shut your mouth! I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm - Teddy! Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!Thank you. What was it for? Bullshit. What cop? Okay. We clean him up, untie him and march him out with a gun in his back.From what? Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you? I think I know her. Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable. You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are. You can't just take it! Quit it! You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why you're so good at it. My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John G's for us to find. All you do is moan. I'm the one that has to live with what you've done. I'm the one that has to put it all together. You just wander around playing detective. You're living a dream, kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense of purpose to your life. A romantic quest which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't in the picture. To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G. No. You took them out. Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him, I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick. I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your wife's death. I believed you, I thought you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife. We found him and you killed him. MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115A. You know, when we found your guy and killed him. That's right, the real John G. Over a year ago. I helped you find him. He's already dead. I thought so too! I was sure you'd remember. But you didn't. You won't remember! No, you won't. Why? You're never going to know. What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not? I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol' Jimmy down there. Are you sure? Sammy didn't have a wife. You exposed him for what he was: a fraud. Sammy was a con man. A faker. Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" - I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin - You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember? That, and your thing. Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead. No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing? What's wrong? Wouldn't be appropriate. I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch. 'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you. He knows you're no good on the phone, so he calls you up to bullshit you. Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so he slips something under your door to frighten you into answering your phone again. He's been pretending to help you. Feeding you a line of crap about John G. being some local drug dealer. Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this. The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back. Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself. That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was. So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership? Like how'd you get this car? That suit? The sort of questions you should be asking yourself. How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions? I won't be happy until you leave town. I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her. She has no idea who I am. She couldn't. Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you. She's gonna use you. To protect herself. She's involved with these drug dealers. Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie. Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy. Teddy. Your buddy. Natalie who? So what are you gonna do now? You like it? Let's trade. Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car. So was he scared? Give me your keys. Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag. We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson. Fucking hope not. How'd ya get him in here in the first place? He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him. Natalie? Natalie who? I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what - Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down? No! Should I? You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes. Probably left it in your room. You're living. You really want to find this guy? Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures. Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy. The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right? Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right? You don't have to remember to be hungry. Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch. So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy. You said you were leaving town. Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over. Lenny, is that you? Yup? Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building. Why are we going there? What the hell you want to go there for? This is your car. Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy. Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become. That's who you were, you don't know who you are. Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name. Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help. You lie to yourself! You don't want the truth, the truth is a fucking coward. So you make up your own truth. A load of amphetamine I told him I had. His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check your tattoos. This bad cop. He checked you into the Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you for days, sticking envelopes under your door, telling you shit. Why would I have a gun?
