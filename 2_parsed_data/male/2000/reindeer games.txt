That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view. And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar. Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you... He'll be dead when he does. Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain. I've been doing good, though. I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you. That's a book, baby. That's a book of love. -- till he fucked his parole -- Searching for a money man... All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters... ...whoever she is. He wants the money. We're talking, aren't we? He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway. Bury him all over the place. And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help! I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play! IS THIS NICK MASON!!?? Is this the fucker you been writing all year!? Is this him!? A man of some travels. Read you're a man of some knowledge. Read a lot about you, Nick. You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you. Must have a way with stationery. So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams. Ash? Ash? Get in the CAR! Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End. You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself -- Can't be attracting attention, right? 'Tis the season, convict. Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys. That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters. No gun. No, you're not. No way. I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing. No. NO. We got five. Putting Ashley outside. What's the code? Sing it in pictures, Nick. Start singing. Nick. I been trying to hit you. It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you. Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery? I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else... MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY? You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!? What'd you tell that casino manager? Got something to say to me, Nick? Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV. So we're gonna have a contest. A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain. Don't tip. You got one hour. Get out. You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral. Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place. You do. You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps. Put it on. Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick. Rather be back in the Mountain? Bring back some memories, Nick? We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not. Why not. Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you. So what the hell good are you... They wouldn't have changed the security setup. We walked the place for a week. What the fuck are you talking about. I did. What? And which of these doors here lead up to the security level? We got faith in you, Nick Mason. You're our inside man. You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is. We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how. You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now? The hell you don't. How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day. You knew the place -- Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales -- Wrong, Nick. It's drowning. What's her greatest fear? Be more specific. Where'd she drop her cherry? What'd they call her in college? What'd they call her in high school? What's her middle name? Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work? Where's she work? Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here. Get him back in the rig. A girl says she loves you, you say something. She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart. Hey. She says she loves you, Nick. You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus. And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause. So you could get down her chimney. So you could get with my sister. But you were saying you were... You're not Nick Mason... You what... Put him in the truck. Who are you now. The hell I can't. Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well. Where the HELL did he go? Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move. Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it. Leave the tree. Take 'em. GO!!! OPEN IT!!! Where is he?! Where is he?! The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians! THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE! He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe. Show's over.I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I can't go back to Vegas... He's not Nick Mason... ...so where is he? I don't steal any -- What... Powwow... I don't know... what you're... Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me... I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?! Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody. I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything. Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat. You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow. Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why? There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season... The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money. What about the Powwow Safe? The Powwow Safe?Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one. Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel... And where they hide the real money. How 'bout the tree? You want the tree? Hey. They got a shitload of cookies. Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon -- I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there? His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips? This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down. That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue? And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him. Acid-chewer. There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit? No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around. How long ago was your makeover? Hell yeah. You work here long? Thanks, sister. How are ya. You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free -- You knew there were guns in here! DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!! Where the hell's Gabriel? What about the money? How do we do that? How do we take them out? What the hell was that about -- Having romance problems, Romeo? Buffet. Whaddya think it is? You want that for here or to go? Hi, Nick.Fuckin, Zookerman -- Oh, man -- It's a roach, guy -- I gave them me. Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along. They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man. Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough. Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by -- Do what? Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up... Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man. Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me. Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley? Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing. ...for Christmas... ...be with her... Tell Ashley... I... Tell her... I'll be there ... Ash... Ashley... Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus... Jesus, Rudy -- Alamo... Don't move, Rudy! Rudy, don't move -- Just a roach, Zook. Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume. No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going. So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work. Aw, Rudy. Don't look like he missed the sunlight. Thought you hate your old man. Thought you hated Sidnaw. Shoulda written, Rudy... Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room. No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges. Me and her got a connection. Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking. Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick. Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy. Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know. Why you gotta say a thing like that. Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want... Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms. She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting. And a slice of pecan pie, right? What? Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs. Three days, man. We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do. Hell you haven't. What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?There is no other table -- I'm ninety-two years old -- What? No... But... I had a five... Well...sorry... I... sorry, Mister...I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs -- My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers. Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray. That motherfucker -- Cancer-sucker. Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke? Without having them hit the alarms. Map is kinda dirty, Monster... That's what it looks like! Start talkin Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.I never told you my name. But I never said Rudy. No -- You said Merry Christmas, Rudy. Rudy. How'd you know my name? I'm glad it was me. He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you. I saved your life. We still gonna spend Christmas together? Yeah. That's love. Well. I'm going home. I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home. Keep 'em there for a little while. Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room? We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun... Is there any way you could get into his truck? You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him? If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here. I'm almost done. We need to find a way to make me part of it. I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map. We'll need one. You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns. They'll have guns. Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name. Don't say my name... You saved me. ...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years... All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns... Get to the bridge! HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE! We get to the bridge, we're all right! There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing -- -- drink this for me. Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike. Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now. Get your own room. Get your own room, Ashley. We? What "we"... Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me... They've never done a robbery? Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed? And I'm his ticket. What's the last place they took down? He working for them on this one? Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway? So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they? Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that -- For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings? But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya. Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain. I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where? They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it-- Canada. ...maybe I die for Nick... Nick died for me.... Your pen palls dead, lady. You're in on this. You told him about Nick's letters. He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he. You're not hearing me here -- Get the hell off of me! JESUS CHRIST! I'M NOT NICK! You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me! When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?! You sold him out. You motherfucker. What's going ON!!! What the fuck is going on. ...the truck driver... Your brother... I'm not him. I... You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy. NO! I'll see what I can do. Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work. We'll have more fun in Detroit. Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet -- Well, I don't know about that -- Beauty and fragrances. Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything -- Ash, you've gotten me enough -- Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate? Ashley, Jesus -- Where the hell are you going? Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too... Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him -- Well, wasn't all me, y'know. Had some bad relationships, didn't you. Tell me again. Yeah. Me too. Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know? No, not that, no... I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth. Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this? I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time. One more. Smile. One more. Smile. Do that again. I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to -- Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here. No, hey, I like your coat -- No, no -- I don't think it's negative five. Negative five? Gotta be ten degrees out there. How'd you know my name. How'd you know my name was Rudy. How'd you know my name... Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers. Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE! What, we walking in there and delivering toys? You gotta be kidding me. What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys? Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it. There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat. I'm no threat without a gun. Six men means six guns. You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it. You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six. Six is me. You need six. So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front. You need six. Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know. If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out. Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access. I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me... No, Gabriel... no... He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me! NO! Nothing... I promise-nothing... Nnn... nothing... ...ttt..tt... two out of three? ...never... tried... Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred. Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars? I'm gonna need some money. Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to -- Do I get a country-western name? At least gimme video poker. What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots? A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through? Might as well be. More than you know. 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise. Trust me. They won't recognize me. They won't recognize me. You'd have to get me inside. Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map. When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh... ...the Powwow Safe. And I worked there. For a year. This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around -- This isn't the Tomahawk. I said, who the hell made the map? Hell. Ten? Hey, it's... been two years -- Christmas... Eve... Five million? I don't know. Hey. Nick don't talk till Nick gets something. No. It's her brother. Her brother. A station wagon in Canada. What college. Bam Bam. Samantha. J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances. What? I had better sex in prison. Wish I had a brother like you. She says a lot of things. I never worked at no casino. Yes! Yes! Yes! I shared his cell! I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick! I -- I just wanted to be -- I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place! You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not! No, you can't -- You... you don't know me -- We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations! Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe. What? His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed. I promise you, I didn't know! Merlin, I didn't know -- DROP THE GUNS! NOW! Here's my present to you, truck drivers -- You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms. You gotta get someone upstairs. What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked. He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me. Not with you. Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?! I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate. ...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum... You gave them me. Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember Walk outta there and tell her I was you. How'd you know I'd do it. And you set me up. She set them up. All of them. NICK!!! NO!!! YOU TELL HER! You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT! No, man! No, no, no! GUARD!!! Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD! GUARD!!! GUARD! GUARD! Standing right here, man! Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing -- Good for you. Protein. I don't know, I've seen the business world. What, working security? Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary. Five years, Nicky. Five years. I just want to go home. Just taste that Christmas turkey. All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months. Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog? Oh. She's using a new perfume. What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her. For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature. I'm just talking. I'm just saying. Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas. Yeah. Yeah. And some pecan pie. Get a hot mug of chocolate. First thing I'm gonna do. Hot chocolate. Not yet. Ain't there yet. Get to thinking about it, it won't happen. Haven't thought about it. THEY'LL OPEN ONE! Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money! You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money -- Switch seats with me. You're hitting for MY cards! POP! That was My card! That was my king! That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card! I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes. They changed the layout. Since when? What the hell is this room? Who the hell made this map. I'M NOT NICK!Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four. We sell children's toys -- Toys for... adults? You can't find... what?We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community. The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues. Mr. Bangs. We're aware of your position. We understand you, Mr. Bangs.THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN! There are monsters... ...in the gelatin... Monsters in the gelatin...
