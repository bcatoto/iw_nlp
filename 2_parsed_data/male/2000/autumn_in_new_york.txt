-- and I could have waited to tell  you, but I wanted to leave no room  for misunderstanding. Yes, I do. The minute I laid eyes on you. It's  the saddest thing about getting older.  You know people so quickly. I even  knew you'd end up hating me. Give it time. That she's just a kid. I met Ella at City College in 1938... My ass hurts. SURPRISE! But I thought you loved it. Sure, there is; there's just very  little you're willing to digest. No, it won't. Because it takes at  least a few weeks to get fat and by  then you won't even be speaking to  me. Because we have no future. All I can  offer you is this... what we have  right now... nothing more  meaningful... until it ends. I could have waited to tell you, but  I wanted to leave no room for  misunderstanding. Good evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be  dining with us tonight? We certainly will. Table seven, Jesus,  if it's available. Yes, sir. How are you, Melissa? Good evening, Celia. And how -- Table seven. I'll be right with you. How's it going? Chaos. The house specialty. Easy for you to say, ya prick.  Waltzin' in here like you own the  joint. So who's the new potential ex-wife?  I thought you were still wastin'  time with Tanya-von-What's-her-name. We wisely agreed to cut our losses. In what way? I assure you it's an absolutely  painless procedure. Sure. Especially for me. Actually, I appreciate your concern,  Celia. The truth is I'm a little  worried myself. Seriously. I've been trying to do  better. But... you know how it is... old  habits die hard. Nope. In fact, John's been looking  for an assistant. Tell him you've  just been promoted. Watch carefully, everyone -- they  ought to begin emerging any moment  now. Oh, darling, you know I would if I  could. I'm sorry, do I -- My God, it is. Actually, I doubled it. Are you feeling all right? You look  positively green. How will I know him? Really? If he's rich you might have a fight  on your hands. It only took me twenty years to come  to my senses. Not Katie and Jay's daughter? Impressive. I think we can do better than that. Happy birthday, Charlotte. I'll let you get back to your  celebration. A pleasure to see you again. Leaving so soon? Be still my beating heart. Or is that your heart? For what? Wills Keane. Who did you think it was? And how would you sum it up,  Charlotte? Turning twenty. I don't think so. I called because I'm going to be  attending a benefit... a black-and- white ball.... and I'd like you to  design a hat... for my date. It's a gift. I don't have her  measurements, but she's about your  size. What're you, a six? Good -- then let's assume your hat  size is also the same. It's a risk we'll just have to take. Her dress is a sheath... sleeveless,  black. The hat must, of course, be  black or white or both. No, just plenty of it. How long will  it take? You have till Thursday. I'll need it  here by seven o'clock. I'm at the  Pembroke on Central Park West and  76th. What's your fee? How's five hundred dollars? Charlotte? You say "wow" a lot. It has to stop. You're a woman now. Bye. What do you mean? Thank you, no, I'm fine. Save it, pal! Don't even bother! I  may not have gone to a fancy school  like Bendover -- That would be Andover. -- but when Wills Keane comps three  bottles of Dom to a twenty-year-old  girl, then tells me he did it 'cause  he likes the kid's grandma, I smell  a rat! Okay, I admit it, she interests me. He's gonna do it! I don't believe  it! He moved us back here for nothing! Come on, you're overreacting. Is that what you think? Buddy, since  we hit town, I have done nothin' but  cut you slack! Every week a new woman  on your arm and I didn't say a word.  Why? 'Cause I figured at least they're  in the right demographic. Maybe by  accident you'll trip over something  substantial. But this little girl?  Best she could be is Miss Right's  daughter! I know. It's just that there's  something about her. She's special...  and I just thought -- There wouldn't be much point in lying  to you, would there? Mommy, Daddy, look, look! Hey, they're bigger than you are! Mikey! How ya doin'? A bit early, aren't you? Hey, in this soup, better safe than  sorry, you know what I mean? He's goin' to a fancy party tonight. Watch your step, Miss. What happened? You realize, don't you, that you're  a full eighteen minutes late? Charlotte, relax. What's the point  of being a beautiful young woman if  it isn't to keep your admirers  waiting? In fact, you disappoint me:  I was looking forward to at least  another half hour of suspense. Nope, too late. Anyway, I want to  see the hat. Try it on. It's all right. It's perfect. It's like a tiny  sculpture. If only I had some use for it. My date canceled a few hours ago. I don't know. She was vague. Would  you... like to come in her place? The outfit I bought her is hanging  in the guest room closet. Of course. Nonsense. You're very good. Where  did you learn? So you did see me there. It sounds as though, in a way, she  took your mom's place... I'm sure she did the best she could. I remember when I heard the news  about your parents. You know how  after a crash they print a long list  of names in the newspaper? Well, I  grew up outside Boston, so I naturally  started to scan the list. But  casually, not expecting to -- How old do you think I am? I have no idea what to do! Who was that? Here's to -- That's usually how I feel. But not  tonight. Tonight I feel sixteen...  just sixteen... and three-quarters. Champagne? You see, Charlotte, the way you know  you're getting older is that you  start to notice patterns. People  start falling into types. Pretty  soon you know a person before you've  even been introduced. And if it's a  woman, before the romance even starts,  a whisper in your head tells you  exactly what it is and how long it's  going to last. And the saddest, the  most tedious, part of all is that  that little voice is almost always  right. Now, what I like about you -- and I  think that's actually what inspired  this little lecture -- is that I  find you completely unprecedented...  and, therefore, wholly unpredictable. What? Now wait a minute. Well, he's a wise man. Oh, really? Listen -- That's right, because, look, I could  put this off, but I genuinely like  you. So I want to be clear... right  now... from the start, so there's no  chance for misunderstanding later. What I want to say you is.... well...  that all I can offer you is this...  what we have right now... nothing  more substantial... just this...  until it ends. The truth is, we have no future  together. What... what do you mean? Mr. Keane? Dr. Sibley. Thank you so much for taking the  time. It's my job, sir. Please, sit down. Now, Mr. Keane, on the phone you  referred to Charlotte's condition as  cancer. That isn't strictly accurate.  Neuroblastoma is a soft tissue  malignancy, but it isn't cancer --  although it sometimes can be just as  aggressive. It's most common in children. In  young adults, the condition is  extremely rare. In Charlotte's case,  the tumor is located in her chest.  It's growing rapidly and has proved  resistant to both irradiation and  chemotherapy. And because of its  proximity to her aorta, surgery is  out of the question. So then what treatment is she getting? At present? Nothing. Eventually she'll be treated for  pain. In the end, surgery could become  an option, but her chances of survival  would be slim. Right now Charlotte's  against it. She's signed a directive  forbidding any sort of heroic  intervention. There's more here if you're  interested, but it won't mean much  to you. How long? Optimistically? A year. Okay, pal, where to? I think what Miss Harris is trying  to say, is that you've strained her  credulity. So I've been told. Okay, then what happened? Not much. I took her home and she  pointed out an irony -- that fate  was now offering us the very same  thing that just this morning I'd  told her was all I could offer her:  a relationship with no future. A kid figured that out? She's not a kid! That's what I've  been trying to tell you. Nothing's  lost on her. I'm the kid. She... I  don't know what the hell she is... But I do know what she was. A virgin. What? I had no idea. That's the only reason  she had her party here, so she could  lure me into doing the honors. She used you, pal. I know. The hangman got hanged. How's it  feel? Embarrassing. So what now? I end it. How come? What, you're endorsing this now? I don't know, when you talk about  her, you're not such an arrogant son  of a bitch. You get all whiny and  stupid. I like that. Thanks. And since I don't see you gettin'  serious with any of your other  victims, I figure why not spend a  little time together? Because she's dying. I got bad news for you, brother, so  are you. For you. No, thanks. It really is uncanny. I tell you, in  that dress you're the spitting image  of Michel Simon. A French character actor, long dead,  who was not only hideous and fat,  but quite male. I know. What do you mean? Dolly, look -- What do you mean, you knew? Two days is long? You're psychic? But we hadn't even been introduced  yet. CAREFUL! We could go to a museum. Nothing at all? So a movie is out. Ice cream at the Plaza? High tea at  the Palace? What about shopping? It's not a thing? But all I gave you was champagne.  That's not a proper birthday present. When? Why not? Oh, I see... because you're sick.  Because -- How come? Any particular reason? Are you sure? I mean, there are  specialists who -- I think that goes without saying. It's been a lifelong dream of mine.  But will a scarf do it? Good advice. I'll remember that for  when I get old. That I'm old. I don't know why, but for some odd  reason, I feel absolutely compelled  to tell you the truth about this...  even at the risk of -- I never had a date for the benefit.  My plan from the beginning was for  you to come with me. The eulogy you gave at Ella's service  was so... impressive. You spoke about  her death... about loss... in a way  that I could never have done. You  understood life emotionally in a way  that I didn't. Whatever that  understanding was, I wanted to get  close to it. And the most enjoyable, yeah. Thanks. All right. I got restless. Not a soul. What? No. I'm not sure I like that motto. What? That's it! So many words in that wonderful head  of yours... Words? Oh no, your boy made it! At ten  minutes before close! All night I  got a card announcing a halibut  special, only I got no halibut! Now  it's Sunday and I got three dozen  cats lickin' their chops in the alley!  Tony, I don't wanna hear it! I don't  wanna hear it! I don't wanna -- MAN, Are you familiar with the phrase,  "You can catch more flies with honey  than with vinegar?" Are you familiar with the phrase,  "Mind your own god damn business?" Sure, it's from Poor Richard's  Almanac. But the last time I checked -- No, your business is to smile, make  friends, and get rich! My business  is the business. What're you doin' here, anyway? You  got a girl. Go home. Carve a pumpkin. We can't spend every waking moment  together. Why not? No, seriously. Why not? No trouble? Every year. You got no imagination. It's a classic. A little spirit gum  and voila! -- young women are rendered helpless. Of course -- it's biological. What's goin' on? What do you mean? At home. Nothing. Honestly. We're having a  lot of fun. We're very happy. I'm not even tempted! Sure, thanks. Mmmm. Incredible. Absolutely incredible. Give me a hint. Was that the hint? The truth is out. I've lost you  forever. No, I think we make a great couple.  A good witch and a bad hombre. That  could make for some very interesting  sex. O, Ricky, chill out! You're gonna  get snot in the water! That's it -- outta the pool! We got a volunteer! Wonder Woman? Batgirl? Princess Di? Wendy? Yup, I'd know that throttle anywhere! Last time I saw him, he was in the  kitchen going pretty heavily with  Holly Golightly. Hell hath no fury like a recluse  scorned. You know, in my day, you bobbed for  the apple, and, sure, maybe there  was a nickel inside it and that was  sweet -- but you ate the god damn  apple! These little animals grab the  coin and they're out the door! Exactly my point. The Prince of Darkness? Yeah, he went upstairs. Hey, looking for me? We were checking out the roof. John's  got quite a set-up. Wendy, this is Charlotte Fielding.  Charlotte -- my friend Wendy Lister. Is the party over? I have a strange feeling that you're  upset with me. Ever? You're not serious. Of course not. Why would I want to  do something like that? Well, there you have it. Sure, except that -- Look, I never pretended to be anything  other than -- This was all a mistake. Right from  the start. All of it. I'm a grown  man and you're a child. Anyway, you have better things to do  with your last -- With your time  than spend it with me. Thank you. It was designed by a team  from -- Actually, no, it's velvet. How are you? Uhhh, good evening, Mr. Keane. Will  you be dining with us? Yes, Jesus. Table seven, if it's  available. Certainly, sir. Hello, Celia. I've been worse. Table Seven. This way, please. Order a drink. I'll be right with  you. Where the hell you been? Splendid, how are you? Where's Charlotte? Deliveries on time? Who's the broad? She looks like a  Holiday-Inn hooker from Ohio. Keep up the good work! That's just it! The great spiritual  benefit in leaving one's room is  that it reminds one of how odious it  is to leave one's room! No problem! There's one thing you don't know  about Mr. Keane and his adultery and  as painful as it is I feel that I  should tell you! That woman on the roof? That was no  ex-girlfriend! In fact, no woman at  all. It was I, Simon Loring, master  of disguise! Willsy and I have moved  in together! Hey, Char! Sorry about that! I bet! Yeah, I got a job working for my  mom's new boyfriend! He sells pot! Not really. I was a driver! I got  laid off when he got busted. He's  awaiting trial! Same thing pretty much. Only for  Domino's! I'm sorry, would you excuse me? Who is it? Nobody! Last time I checked I was your best  friend! So? So after the party, no thank you! I  call you three times -- no call back!  And for six days you don't even eat  at your own god damn restaurant!  What am I supposed to think? Huh?! I  was ready to call the morgue! Relax, I'm alive. Well, you sure don't look it! I'll tell you why it's my concern!  Because I had a god damn swimming  pool! An ocean view! A fabulous lemon  tree hangin' right over my Jacuzzi!  And I gave it up for you, brother!  Back to a life of concrete and dirt  and sirens just so you could get  your shit together! On my roof? You gotta be kiddin'!  Not on my green chair! Tell me it  wasn't on the green chair. Oh, great. Now how am I gonna clean  that? Look, it doesn't matter that she's  sick -- she's still a kid and there's  no way we should be together. It's  unhealthy... it's... it's  inappropriate... What the hell is that? Some sorta  shrink talk? Look, if she were just fun... just  some sort of diversion... maybe I  could justify it. But the worst part  is that it's becoming more. Much  more. It's embarrassing how much I  like her. She gets to me. She affects  me... And she's gonna be gone and... I'm  not sure I can... I mean... I already  think about her all the time... Her smile kills me... and the  thought... that it'll be gone...  forever... that I'll never see her  again... I don't know... I can't --  I don't think I'm that strong, Johnny.  It's too much. I'd rather have it be  over... over now. I'll start missing  her now. Buddy, I hate to break it to you,  but in the real world... where I  live... there're only two kindsa  love stories. Boy loses girl and  girl loses boy. That's all there is.  Somebody always gets left behind.  You try to avoid that, you'll end up  an old man toastin' yourself with  egg nog in the mirror on Christmas  Eve. You'll end up dying in your own  arms. Good. I'm... I'm glad. Patty, I... I want to be honest with  you... right now, from the start...  so there's no room for  misunderstanding. I didn't have a  good time, but it's nothing personal.  I just split up with someone and  rather than admit to myself how much  I miss her, I asked you out instead.  And it's unfair. If I feel sad I  should just feel sad and not try to  use you... and your body... as some  sort of painkiller, right? Anyway, I think you're a warm and  engaging woman and I wish you all  the best. Mr. Keane -- Good night, Michael. You've got a visitor. Who? She's been waitin' almost an hour.  In the lobby. A little surprise for ya. No, no. Not at all. You surprised  me, that's all. I didn't expect to  see you... not here... not after  your letter. I followed you in. I wasn't even  sure it was you. All I have is an  old snapshot. I didn't mean to run off like that. I saved it. So do I. Look, why don't we go  upstairs. Lisa -- Congratulations. That's  wonderful. Is that what you consider me? How's your mom? Why? Thanks. You're not bad looking  yourself. Already? What is it? Tell me. I am. I'm very sorry. Can I call you? A friend. Where were you? I was worried. I've missed you. You have no idea  how much. Dolly. We watched TV. She fell asleep.  What time is it? Where were you? To tell you that you were right. I  do hate myself. But not so much that  I can't see how stupid and despicable  and -- And cowardly what I did was. And  even though there's no excuse for  it, I want you to forgive me. Because, for better or worse, I'm  falling in love with you, and the  thought of our not being together is  unbearable to me. So where were you? Who's Eric? What'd you guys do? Hung out where? Fine. Talk about what? Is there something  to talk about? What happened? No, honestly, I think I have a right  to know. You're being unreasonable. You know, in this day and age it's  not so outrageous a request. I mean,  I don't know this kid. I don't know  where he's been. It requires balance and I have lousy  balance, okay? Look, I'm not in a sporting mood! I'm jealous, okay?! Is that what you  want to hear? Are you satisfied now? All I want is a simple answer and  you're torturing me! And I resent  it! It's cruel and juvenile! And I -- I wish I were exaggerating, but I'm  not. I slept with every one of them.  Really. Look through Dolly's old  photo albums... or any movie  magazine... visit Aspen at Christmas.  I was on a mission. And until recently  I really didn't think I had a problem.  Or if I did, it was definitely the  most pleasurable one I could imagine. My house in Malibu burned to the  ground. I know, it sounds funny. But it must  have triggered something because the  next thing I knew I couldn't sleep.  I'd lie awake at night absolutely  terrified. Like a kid left alone in  the dark. How quickly time was passing and how  adolescent I still felt. How  meaningless all my choices seemed.  How lonely I was. So I liquidated my  portfolio, sold my businesses, and  moved back here. To start over, settle  down, start acting my age. You were supposed to be my one last  dalliance with youth. Yeah, how come, Uncle Wills? I want to, Carla, but -- Well, Molly, I just haven't met the  right woman yet. I agree. She's also demanding. Where're you goin'? She's decided she wants her birthday  present today. But that was last month. The Dom didn't count. This is her  real present. She chose it herself  and it's not material. Now you got me curious. Okay... breath of fire... now inhale  deeply... hold the breath... let  your heart lotus blossom... feel the  energy rise... and exhale. Good. Now  peacock pose. When does the enlightenment start? Are you all right? Don't worry. You're gonna be okay. Excuse me... do you have an extra  one of those? You a smoker? Not for years. Well, hell, if I'm gonna be the one  to get you goin' again. Thanks. Don't mention it. The repeat MRI and CAT scan do show  interval progression. Which means the tumor's grown? Yes. Yes, it has. Considerably. As  for her loss of consciousness, one  explanation is a disturbance in her  heart's electrical function. We'll  be monitoring her overnight for any  arrhythmias. If we find something,  we'll treat it. Unfortunately, the  more likely explanation is that the  tumor has begun to obstruct the  outflow of her heart. If that's the  case, there's little we can do. We  could be speaking in terms of weeks  not months. When she returns home, we'll want  her to stay active, but don't let  her overexert herself. Don't stay long. She's been sedated. Are you all right? You're okay? How  do you feel? I'll let you rest. I should. You'll  sleep and then -- I do not. It ought to be illegal. Your smile. It's too pretty. You have. Shouldn't I be telling you one? The first would be Emily Dickinson. Charlotte, listen, I -- I just think -- Well, I think I speak for all of us  when I say that we've heard quite  enough from Dolores. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I  believe what you're saying is that  while the end may be in sight, it  has not yet arrived. That's right. The tumor's begun to  interfere with the function of her  heart, but she -- Then why exactly have you called us  here? I cut short a lunch date, Shannon's  missing her low-impact aerobics class,  and Dolores has delayed the start of  her happy hour -- surely you must  have had good reason. I thought Charlotte's health might  be of some interest you. It is. You could have told me all  about it on the telephone. I also thought it might be a good  idea if we discussed ways to make  her as comfortable as possible for  the -- Charlotte loathes comfortable. I  never sought to bore her with comfort  while she was well, why should I  start now that she's sick? Tell me, are you really so cold? Or  is it just a pose that you've  cultivated? It's a pose that I've cultivated. I chose it, as a sort of smoke screen,  some time after attending my twentieth  funeral in as many months. I'm sorry. It's quite all right. But, honestly,  it shocks me how often you people  forget. Our phone books have as many  numbers crossed out as written in.  So that while death is certainly as  painful to us as it is to you, we do  not find it nearly so...  extraordinary. Don't misunderstand me. I adore  Charlotte and when she dies, I  would... were it not already in that  state... cry my heart dry. She's in the hospital now. She doesn't  have long. Weeks maybe and -- She...  Anyway, I have something to ask you.  A favor. I have no right to ask. I  know. I'd do it myself, but I can't.  I'm too... I'm... I want you to find a surgeon. Dr.  Sibley told me... Charlotte's doctor  told me... he said at some point,  when it's hopeless, surgery could be  an option. Heroic surgery, he called  it. I want to make sure that when  the time comes a hero is performing  that heroic surgery. Do you  understand? You'll have to make calls.  I'll get names. Sibley will give me  names. I'm sorry to ask you... I have no  right. But, you see, she doesn't  want it... this surgery... I'll have  to convince her. So no one can know...  for now. And I trust you. You're my  only family and I... You have every right to refuse me.  After what I did. You were a child...  and you needed me... and I was nowhere  to be found. There's no excuse for  that. I'm so terribly sorry! I am, too. So sorry. I should be the  one. It should be me. What do you want to know? Well, I remember a little more than  that. Let's see... she was blonde...  about your height -- Oh, okay. She... always ate her ice  cream with a fork -- how's that? And she wrote great letters, but  couldn't spell at all. She was a McGovern Democrat but also  an incredible snob. She loved  blueberries. She had the world's  worst backhand. Her favorite singer  was Stephen Stills. Never mind. She was afraid of sharks.  And, considering the times, she was  pretty square. She only tried drugs  once -- a lifeguard gave her a hash  brownie and she threw it up all over  him. And she laughed just like that. And  she bit her fingernails. And she  couldn't tell a joke. In short, she was a unique. She told me. Yes. That's how she got my attention;  it's not why I fell in love with  her. I fell in love with her because she  charmed me senseless day and night  for an entire summer. I have no idea. The summer was over.  Your mom was going back to Smith. I  was moving down here to work on Wall  Street. It was our last day together.  She was crying. She told me, for the  first time, that she loved me. I  said I loved her, too. I promised to  call and visit. A few hours later I  was in a cabana with Millie. When Millie told me she was pregnant  and that she wanted to marry me, I  escaped to L.A... and I never saw  her or your mom again. I think it's part of the reason I  never came back. I might as well have been. For as  long as I can remember, I've always  run off at the first sign of a woman  wanting anything from me... relying  on me in any way. I know. Maybe. But it doesn't feel that way. It feels as though I'm not afraid  anymore. Driver! Quick! Pull over here! Right  here! I didn't know you couldn't! TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX, FIVE, I love you, Charlotte. Mr. Keane, you get her outta here  or, I swear to God, I'm gonna  butterfly and stuff her! I'll add it to the specials list. You seen Celia? What's the matter? The matter is I got a half-hour wait  and no help up front! You got a call  on Two! Wills Keane. Listen, I'm not gonna bullshit you.  If she were a baby, she'd have a  decent chance, 'cause these sorts of  tumors can regress like crazy, but  she's twenty and... I don't know,  man... I've never seen anything like  it. I mean, look! It's wrapped around  her vital structures like an octopus! You know, just once I'd like to get  sent something simple. A "cabbage,"  a valve replacement. Even a good old- fashioned transplant. But it doesn't  happen anymore. It's the downside of  being good at my job. Good? They say there's no one better. I don't know. I'm like most people.  I do the best I can. Can your best save her? Probably not. In these sorts of cases, it's best  if she signs a consent. No problem. Good. The last time Charlotte passed out,  she regained consciousness almost  immediately. The next time or the  time after, she won't. When that  happens, call me. Here's my service. They'll reach me  no matter where I am. In the meantime,  I'll coordinate with Dr. Sibley. I can't thank you enough. I haven't done anything yet. What do you mean? I was in Montclair, New Jersey. An opportunity. I was considering opening a  restaurant. But the rents are too  high. Bah humbug... Will you and Mister Keane be goin'  away for the holidays? I've seen so little of America. I  don't care for airplanes, you see,  and I have so little time to travel. Did Mister Keane enjoy his trip then? Why, just yesterday. Perhaps not. But I've never been to  Ohio myself. They say parts of it  are quite lovely. All right, you little hellions! Get  in here! Straight? I'm sure we do. About what? I met with a heart specialist. He's  willing to operate. Well, maybe I want it. Of course not, but if you'll hear me  out -- Oh, Christ, knock it off! You're  such a god damn saint, so above it  all, but you're scared to death! You  do want to live! And if you were as  honest as you say you are you'd let  the doctors do whatever they can to  help you! Why not?! Maybe we want hope! Or  maybe we just need to know that we  did everything we could! Maybe I  need to know that... if I'm going to  be able to live... to go on without...  without -- So had I. You don't ever have to worry about  that. Yeah? A couple of hours. That's all right. Relax. Nothing. Don't! Don't move! Just one more  minute! You were just going to tire yourself  out! Just hold on! Finishing touches! Almost! Voila! Time cannot break the bird's wing  from the bird. Bird and wing together  Go down, one feather. No thing that  ever flew, not the lark, not you,  Can die as others do. Ruined me for other women. Is she type 'n' cross for six units?! Yes, Doctor. What're we waiting for? Then let's move! It happened so quickly. We'd just  talked about the surgery. She agreed  to it. But I thought there'd be time. I've had friends who weren't expected  to last till morning who lived another  seven years. Another ran a marathon  and died the next weekend. It's all  so terribly random the way life  actually works. I take nothing for  granted. You know, it's funny, the first time  I saw her, I -- I guess not.
