Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise. Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say? You. You're the guy that lent me the money. Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you. If you could see your way to lending me some cash - I'll share something with you. Just five dollars, please. I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad. Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe. Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out. I'm Daffy. Excuse me.Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world. You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy. What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?What about Moliere? She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her. She is gone! I'm sorry. Nothing. I just thought you ought to know. Yes. I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters. A fin! Richard - I saw a fin! We're ok. So how many miles do you think it is? So? Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point. Why? One or two kilometers. He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night. There is one problem. It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath. Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there. We moved rooms because of him. She means your neighbor. The Scotsman Good morning. Richard? One kilometer We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim. It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning. It's on an island that no one get to. What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.Thanks. Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet - Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep. Just take it, OK. Here. I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money. I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it. I'm sorry, I don't think so. Help you out? Richard. Hi. Yes? I wouldn't know anything about that, sir. I don't think so. Traveler. Fuck off. Was there a shark? Did you see a shark? What happened? A bit fucking late. Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it. Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it. Big? A shark fin? What! I think we're about half way. Everyone ok? I have no idea but it looks like a long way. We think in miles, not kilometers. I don't know - I'm American. Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone. We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then? Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going? Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is? That's the wrong one. Nice work. It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to. Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did. The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday. Bonjour. If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we donï¿½t try then we'll never know. Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well. Exactly. There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen. You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself. I think so too. Francoise - No. Swim? So from there to there? Hi there. Here, take a look. Not too bad. Eh - bonsoir. Uh-huh. So? Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth. Where did you lose it?So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach. Exactly. Always happened to someone else. Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?" We lost our key.
