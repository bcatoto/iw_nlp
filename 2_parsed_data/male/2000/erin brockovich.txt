Hey, excellent. Thanks. Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here. PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation. 250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer. A million things could have caused those problems. Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle. Our offer is final and more than fair. I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault. In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control -- So you say. So. You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon. There's more than one? Seventeen thousand in debt. Whew. Is your ex-husband helping out?Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ... She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case. I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now. It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport. Thanks. I'll keep it in mind. Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here. You're kidding, right? Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions. What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors. 250,000? All of them. Fax these to this number, okay? What's she doing here? I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor. Jesus. Look at me. What do I have this afternoon? What the hell is this doing here? You shouldn't judge, Brenda. Whoa. Remind me. Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client. What do you think? What's this? Oh, Jesus. Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time? The firm took in sixty. That's three percent. Seemed like a fair bonus to me. Take it. Okay, fine. Fine You backed me into a corner again. You're holding me hostage ... "I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..." The extortion, the threats ... Oh, okay. Here it comes. You see your office? Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing. Give him another chance. But I know you're not gonna quit on me. The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin. The luckiest son of a bitch in history. I did. Both. I was wrong. I don't know what to say. Ho - ly - shit. Erin? What are you -- Erin -- Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon. This isn't doctor's orders. It's mine. I'm saying you can't come. You're not gonna be there. Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse. I know . We're having a meeting, it's all set up -- Hey, that's not so bad. Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime. So in legal terms, ten years is -- Five years, maybe, for a trial. Double that for the appeal. Because. They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial. Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of -- With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that. Still a lot of money. Uh-huh. I'm not gonna fire you. I wanted to. But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit. You embarrassed me, Erin. Don't give me that. You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ... No one's taking anything -- Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't -- You're emotional. You're erratic. You say any God damn thing that comes into your head. And I'm not saying that's bad. That can be great; that can be a lot of fun -- Look, this is serious now. They're talking serious money -- Okay, look. It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers -- Look, you said you weren't feeling great. I thought you should rest. Erin, it's just a meeting. Gee, I wonder why. Because that's how people treat each other ! Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding. But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect -- He's got a reputation for doing all his -- Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to -- It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case. Their lawyers go -- Don't joke. They might. So do me a favor and behave yourself for once. Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter. It's eight million dollars, Erin. Eight million dollars. Maybe. but maybe not. We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem. Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ... And it's less than pocket change for PG&E. I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision. 50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever. But ... It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff. Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer. 20 million, plus attorney's fees. Take it or leave it. I'll see what I can do. Is that what you want? Erin, you're a big girl. If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with -- Oh, Jesus. You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or -- I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here -- Do you mind? I was just asking. Are you all right? He's gone. Did you get a license plate? Or a make? What kind of truck? What? Who? He said he'd be at the gas station at six. Hey. A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you. I told him we'd be out there Thursday. They're trying to intimidate us. Tell them to wait in the conference room. From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously. Hey. I like working with you. I would now. Me too. That's why I like it. It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about. I like this case. Then they didn't know. And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is. Show me the document that proves that. PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley. We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls. But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco. Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something. Erin -- lemme tell you something. If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here. This is some damn good work. No shit. Jesus. I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk. They skipped that step. And that's what caused the contamination? I don't remember seeing any ponds up there. You wanna talk about -- Is that what I think it is? What now? Yeah, yeah. Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy. Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family. Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it. I'll take it on. This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal. You think there's more? How many families we talking about here? Oh, you do? With all your legal expertise, you believe that? I know how DNA works, Erin -- -- It's about being realistic. Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation. They'd completely bury us in paperwork. I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm. It's not about working hard -- Because I said no. Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute. We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility. No, thank you. Hunh-uh. Absolutely not. Then I don't get anything either. Erin -- Erin -- Yeah. Isn't that a shame? What, you think I'm made of money? Because they can. You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal. They can afford to waste all the time in the world. That wasn't an offer. A million would've been an offer. When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you. It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice. I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting. Find out. This is the only thing you found? A ten percent raise and benefits. But that's it. I'm drawing the line. Okay. A 5% raise, and -- Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense. Lemme see it, will you? That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you? I didn't see any medical records in there. What medical records? So what made you think it was? But, PG&E told her about the chromium? So what's the story on this thing? This cancer stuff? I don't know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun. Look, I'm sorry. You were gone. I just assumed you were off having fun. He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million. And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings. I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel. Come on, I'm trying to help here. Okay, enough -- Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf. Find you something else, okay? That's not how we work here. You don't just leave a message and take off. Erin, you've been gone for a week. How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl. You're a girl. Good. You do know how to do that, don't you? Oh. Huh. Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing. A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it. Where's Anna? Bullshit, you don't. All I have is hundreds. Jane's the office manager. She handles payroll and petty cash. But she leaves early on Fridays. Yeah? Okay, look. If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does. Send in a r�sum�, make an -- I'm sorry about that. Really. But -- I never lied. I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but -- You did? Wow, sorry about that. Listen, Mario's a little not so bright. He seems to think that you said -- I'm sorry, Erin. Okay -- let's try and settle down here. I told you the questions might get a little personal -- If you hadn't used profanity -- Yeah. I know. Right. Corey. Sixty-nine. We've got good answers to all of 'em. Yesterday.Good luck. Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ... Every county has one. They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction. You should be able to find something there. Have you been to the water board? Oh, yeah. Definitely. Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic. Bad, bad stuff. With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer. Yes. There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful. What kind of chromium is it?... or lemme guess -- toxic waste? How does someone get meningitis? Jesus. Meningitis? What the hell is meningitis? Promise you'll turn around if you get tired. We'll just be a minute. Get a little more sleep. Real early. We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast. You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick. Think you could learn? Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find. How long's this whole thing gonna take? They up? I don't do favors for you anymore. Hello? Mm-hm. Fine. I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon. I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be. More than you need me. Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time. I know. But still. Six months. I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend. Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em. It's a pair of earrings. I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em. And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em. Know how long ago that was? Six months. In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me. That's a long time. About this. Thinking. Bull shit , Erin. Bullshit. Fuck you. Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am -- It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while -- Lock the door. I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here? I'm bored, and so are the kids. Yeah. We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball." Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here. Beth started talking. What do you want, a joke? I know what they can sleep through, Erin. I probably know it better than you. Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again. Would that make you happy? If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so. You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean? It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin. There's a lot of jobs out there. Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here? Come on, Erin. A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger. I'm just saying -- One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else. You're someone to me. You're someone real special to me. You are someone. You're not nothing, Erin. What? But you been working so hard -- It's a simple thing. Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator. I'm gonna clean it up. Fixing a leak under your sink. What do you mean? I guess we get what we pay for, huh? I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too. This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know. Better safe than sorry. Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we? Yup. Usually working on my bike. No big deal. If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady. Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them. Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it. Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you? I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap. I'm not a deadbeat. I work when I need to. I was serious before, you know. If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons. How? Yeah, and whose fault is that? Why not? You need help with your kids? I could probably do that. C'mon. I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night. You got a little girl? Ten? You got more than one? I do. Now, don't be like that. Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness? Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different. Let's start over. My name's George. What's yours? Just introducing myself to the neighbors. Well, hello to you, darlin'.How come her own mom isn't helping her? She's one of the sick people? You never fall short for the work people. I guess maybe you just love them more. You always say that. Then you go to work and forget you promised. I'm gonna go live with George. Randy's mom said yes right away. When? Can I play roller hockey? Yeah. Well I hate it.I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study. Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC. You did? Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer. They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong. And these guys -- Donna and Peter -- Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names? Shanna and Ashley? Of course! Oh, gosh, of course -- Oh. Oh. He did, didn't he? Baxter ! Is this a joke? Did Baxter put you up to this? Yes?I think we should makes some changes. I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what -- Good. Who's the judge? How many counts? When'd they file the demur?I don't know what you're talking about. You know what, Erin? I got nothing but time here. Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner. You're married. Pattee? That your middle name? Heck, yeah. Come on back. Just gonna need you to sign in here -- You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you. You come to the right place. Erin. Cool. What can I do for you, Erin? Ross. Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
