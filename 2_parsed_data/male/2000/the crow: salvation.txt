Was that it? Well, ok. You're wrong. You sent them. I had no choice. I'm looking for my friends. Where are they? Last chance. Where are they? What? Call the police? Where is it? This place? The strip joint? Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King. I was hoping you'd find out. Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out. You think I'm crazy. The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. Two down. Two to go. Dream on. We won't. What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing? You killed her. I saw it. A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car. This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five. Think maybe knives do? I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people... What did they give you? What did they give you? Wrong. Answer. One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car. You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today. Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis. Exhibit A. You lied at my trial. Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator? All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator. Sssshhh. She's resting. The scar. Good thing in a situation like this. AAAANK. That's not how we play the game. We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar." I was talking about you. How can you die if you're already dead? The scar. Which of you has it? I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why. What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident? I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you. I heard you were looking for this. Erin. I'll always be with you. ... it connects you to me... Erin. Who? It's ok, it's ok... It's what Lauren would do. All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy. You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me... Have to find him first. ... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing. This tree. Here's where it happened. No. You don't. Erin. It's not your fault. No... Are you ok? This is where it happened. Right over here. Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful. From the bonfire over there. Look at it. No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know. This. I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why. I'm not hiding. I'm right here. And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn. I told you, I knew your sister. I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you. He didn't kill her. Someone else did it. Your father gave them to both of you. That locket you're holding. You have one just like it. I was a friend of your sister's.I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing. Yeah? I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends? It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it. Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong. How many innocent people did you leave dead back there? See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No? around, or whatever the hell you're doing here. What are you doing here? Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet? Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion? I hate that picture. Maybe we had a case of that here. Get me my kit. Give me a hand with this sack of shit. Just don't believe everything you see. He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it. Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want. The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that. Sign of the dead come back to life. Could say that. Good for you. You do know something. Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday. You know. Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now. Shut up. I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount. Erin knows, doesn't she? I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself. An accident, Nathan. Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident. I mean Lauren. Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.You're him. Corvis. Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die. Nobody. Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way. Not my arm! What you fucking want? Fuck. Me. You're the guy killed Dutton.You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that? Doubt is a motherfucker. Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know. How about sign of a big black bird? Fucking crow. Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right. They botched the execution. Guy dressed for Halloween? Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case. I know the guy leaves a sign. I know. Yeah, we do.A job. Construction. Twelve an hour. They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes." Who are you? There's no scar. Corvis made it up. What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker. Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl. I don't know you, man. Where the fuck did you come from?There is no scar. I'm telling you. Fucking Zombie. You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man! What Scar? What fucking scar?I think we should get some support? I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT. We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole." Yeah. I sure will. What do they do that they had to kill her? I'm thinking... that explains a lot. "Down?" Wait, don't tell me. Check and mate. Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar. Tell her... we'll get him.
