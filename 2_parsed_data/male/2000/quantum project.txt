Yes.... What was her name? The one I met. What was her name? -- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor? What then? What did your life mean?

To an armed camp. To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.Mia...? Excuse me??? You did miss -- You did. Dad... You taking any medication? Why? Then you get it. You'll understand. Wait. I want to tell you something. That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together -- A five hundred foot thick steel wall.

"What do you want?" I didn't answer. I was in the middle of an experiment. God. I dunno. The eternal nothingness. Mia. How? Nothing is real until it's perceived. A quantum one. Could be. At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic. They connect in unimaginable ways. It's an experiment. That's the physicist's playground. Where to? I could go out of town. Okay. Could we go somewhere? I've been dreaming about you.
