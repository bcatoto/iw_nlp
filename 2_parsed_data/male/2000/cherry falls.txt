Ok! One more time. That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting? Not my imports. WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress? You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight. Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector. As fucking if. Exactly. Then he must be a virgin. What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy. Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling... IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen. Better than a pile of dead teenagers. I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m. is there anything you do? If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today. So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex. She's my daughter, Tom. Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston? I just wanted to check that you were okay? But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends. No. Run! Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school. What did you hear? You were eavesdropping. Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today. It can't be. Are you sure? I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep. I'm not. No honey. Ok. You never went, uh, all the way? I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to. How much further? I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further? Well, I assume you let him kiss you? I have a question to ask you. A personal question. Hi honey. I want you to head right home after school. Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone? How well did you know Stacy and Rod? Hi honey. They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight. You said that two weeks ago. Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss. You're grounded Friday night! It's almost ten o'clock. I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Are you sure? No? No. I'll handle this. There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going. What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'? She's underage. What are you doing? No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep. She's still a virgin. Is Jody still awake? Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me. Why? Really? No, you couldn't. No. Is there a picture of her somewhere? I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here. Can you get inside? Can you describe her? How old was she? She was murdered? Of what? She works at a church? You know where I can find her? I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement. Yeah. You should check downstairs. I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest. Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh? No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her? I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant. I can. I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it. No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day. A bullet to the right cerebellum. She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago. St. Michael's. She's not here. Hello?No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you. Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go. Your brother told us. I know where you're going.We're seeing all the signs in town. Should we close down any eruption? As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight. We need you here. I can bring her in. You found her? The same type that decides to carve into her stomach. No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen. Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school. Jesus. Any word from Brent? Who's?I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon. I was grounded for two fucking months because of you! You gave me a 'D'. You fucked me up! What are you doing here?Pretend we're just another couple. Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there. I love you. Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away. He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here! I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party. Jody. Wait. Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party. Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me. Sharon's far from a slut. That's not why we broke up. Yeah. Just making me feel like a piece of meat. Are you coming to the party? I don't know. I kind of am. But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody. I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends. All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid. Yes! They're not picking me up until six. I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together. Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him. If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it. Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose. You know I want to go with you. Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me. Why? I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash? I heard you got attacked. Are you O.K.? Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience. You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people. Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you. So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter. Why? I'm worried about someone. I got to go. There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught. Just thinking about something.Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone. I think I know how to restore your reputation. He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school. I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you. His mother's side. Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you. I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa. Are you Jody?Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you. I'm sure you should have failed. What? Pay no attention to me. You think you're my sister? Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded. I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one. Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is? He's a rapist. Like mine. Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you. Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting. We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born. I really do. For your own safety. Then you should go. of COURSE. You're not scared? You aren't going to the party? Can you just follow me? The back is full? My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.Now don't be nervous. You're so beautiful. You can have both if you want. They're tasty. Did you want one? Hi Sandy. Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.Told you to hide it. You can't bring it. Hide your laptop here. There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.Hey! That was a 3k machine. I'm not leaving it here. No. Ok.But I shouldn't shut it down? Ok. Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert. Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder. We just found another body.Stacy? Yes. Unfair to me. You're being unfair. Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me. That wasn't me ... On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love. Aren't you worried you could die a virgin? Let me just ask you a serious question first. Maybe it won't stay in. But you don't really mean it.Calm down Brent. That's impossible. You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands. Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday. Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about? Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows? So? The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that? Hi Jody. Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is. Good. You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
