That's what we want. Reaction. And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em. Let 'em riot, we can handle it. We'll be ready. I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that. Over the edge, in fact. What do you think? Dick likes it. We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by. They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing. We're called SDM. Sonic Death Monkey. We're not as bad as you think, Rob. No. We need the gig. We're getting that anyway. Laura said we could. If we helped out with the posters and stuff. And we did. And we are. HELLO. DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson? Mr. Phil Spector? I heard you, man. Don't give me that "what" shit. You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them. What the fuck is that? Yes way. It's really... The little skate-fuckers. Oh. Right. But I'd forgotten about that. I wasn't biting the idea. Haven't seen it. I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want." Whatever. Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it. Ooh. Drag. What's up? So much for friends, then. You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that? You're not even coming? How many tickets can I put you down for? That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But -- They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay? It wasn't my idea. I didn't make up the name. It's the Steely Dan song. And it was in The Commitments. Thanks for your support, Rob. Really appreciate it. The band that found me and asked me to join. My band. Hey. Suck my ass. Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you? You two have to stick together now. Boners United. United in getting some. Oh come on, Rob. What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick? What rational explanation can there possibly be? What's her name? Un-fucking-believable. Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all. Fine by me. I still want pay to 7 o'clock. I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now? Because it's a brilliant film. It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass. How the fuck am I supposed to know that? You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie. ...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it. Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to. Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone... "-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you -- I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here. I don't understand any part of this conversation. You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen. What am I supposed to say? I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you. To me, it would mean that you're a liar. You saw it twice. Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick. We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century. -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit -- Ooh! A kind of recent record! Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that? Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all. Dick, did you hear that? Ehh. What am I missing? What do you have to be happy about? What are you snickering about? What? We can take your car. We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all! All three of us. I didn't know it was classified information. I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy. ...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes... I wanna date a musician... Yeah. Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker? You're going soft in your old age, Rob. There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street. Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy. You're right, Rob. I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club? He offended me with his terrible taste. Bullshit. The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway. Why not have a little fun? Big fucking deal. "Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular? Oh, so what's the point then? We didn't even really have it. I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny. Rob. Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's. Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins? "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?" Well what's the point in that? Great. That's the fun of working in a record store. Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to. I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it. Since when did this shop become a fascist regime? "Little Latin Lupe Lu." Play it. Don't you want to hear what's next? But it's my new tape. My Monday morning tape. I made it last night just for today. Public Enemy! All I'm trying to do is cheer us up. Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care. What are you doing? IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER. NO--! That is perverse. Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde. What about Television? Do not get ahead of yourself. They always seemed what? They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed. They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums. I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane. Oh really. Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain? It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD. Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables. But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album -- Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma? Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not. Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time. No, you can't. Oh yeah. We got it. -- It was Dean, you fucking idiot. Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean... He's not worth it! Anna Moss. Mossy. The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing. Is she all green and furry? Anna who? Anna Green Gables? Anna Conda? Who are you going to see? Why? We work there! On Clark Street! You can be and are wrong. No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album. Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?" Bullshit. No, not nothing. What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers? What? No. The Righteous Brothers. Holy Shiite! What the fuck's this? Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary. That's all. The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite. Do you have an appointment? Oh, hi. "Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.Oh God, no. I didn't want to hurt his feelings. It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more. In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him. It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow. You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean. Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange. And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself? Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of. A little sunnier. Sparkier. I don't know. You know what people are like at that age. They make very superficial judgements. Do you think that's superficial? He was a clown, if it's any consolation. There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving. In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it. Do all men go through this? Fuck! I knew it! You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things. Hey Rob. Great. Gotta go. See you then. Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now. Listen. Do you want to come to dinner Saturday? I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man? Good. Great. Yeah... Wow. Rob Gordon. Seems like a 100 million years ago now. Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business. You know how it gets.I have a television. Well what about the new Echo -- They always seemed... I have all of the others. What's your problem? What did I... Why are you -- Why not? Great. Can I have it then? I'm looking for a record for my daughter. For her birthday. "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his -- Don't do it, Rob! Anna Moss. Anna. Nobody. I can't go to the club tonight, guys. You'd love it! A couple blocks! About six! He's got one! It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The." But I could be wrong. That's what I said. She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile." Nothing. I just prefer the other one. Nothing. Oh well. Nevermind. Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels? It's the new -- It's Vince and Justin. "Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one. I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's -- Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob. Well we rang $900 today. Do it. Do it. Rob --! Marie LaSalle is in the store! Here, she's here, and now! Rob. I want a tape. Yeah. Sure. 'Course. Rob, look. Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing? Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight. I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that. And he likes you. It's just that -- I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously. Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle playing at Lounge Ax tonight. I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good. So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing. I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff. 'Course I will, Rob. No problem. No problem at all. I'll tell him next time I see him. Are you all right? Can I help you? The new Belle and Sebastian. Like it? Well, I'll just make it for you. 'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc. The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover. You didn't see the cover though. I'll tape it for you. Yeah, OK. I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl. The one on Testament of Youth. Never released here. Japanese import only. Oh, hi. Hi, Rob.Conflict resolution is my job, Laura. Maybe I should talk to him. You look upset. Laura? Are you okay? Think about it, Rob. So shall we leave it at that then? Good. So shall we leave it at that then? Good. So shall we leave it at that then? Think about it, Rob. Good. So shall we leave it at that then? We've noticed and we're glad. But, you know... how are we going to make peace here? We want to make things easier for you. What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment. I'd hate it if I lost her. But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision. Do you see what I'm saying? We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob. We're talking actionable harassment. Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house... Come on, Rob. My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal. Hello, Rob. Remember me? I'm Ray. Ian.Technically, I'm number one. I went out with her a week before Kevin did. Her first boyfriend. Me. Really? Married Kevin? Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that? None, no chance. That's just fate. You gotta be kidding me. Rob. Rob Gordon. Circa junior high... Long time ago. I was just thinking about her. I was her first boyfriend. Alison's. Do I know you? You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night. Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey. Sonic Death Monkey. You couldn't be. Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums. How are you going to cope with them? 110%. That's my final offer. I'm not kidding. That's how much it means to me not to hear you play. What is she doing? Okay, 20%. I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play. Like fuck you are. So? You even said they're good. What? No way. Not really. Liar. We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat. Because it's in The Big Chill. Fuck off, Barry. It was Jan, and it was a long time after-- Laura. Her dad died. Bitter? Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk. Just keep that out of my window. Of course I'm not coming. Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave? Where is it? The fucking Bucktown Pub? Ha! None. Christ! Great! That's fucking great! They only asked you to sing because of your name! You can stick it above the browser racks over there. Isn't it? That's why you got the gig, isn't it? You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown. Barrytown. Barrytown? Is there no end to your arrogance? You are not in a band, Barry. You are not a musician. And no posters. What band? What the fuck is that? Terrific. Don't be sad, Barry. You'll find true love someday. Shut the fuck up, Barry. How do you know about that? Ha. Let's pack it up. We haven't had a customer in four hours. Why would they care? But in your opinion, would I definitely go? Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it? Just listen to me. If I said to you -- No, but would you think, from that one sentence. That I was going to see it? Yeah, yeah, I know. But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think? Just... come on, what would it mean to you? That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?" -- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean? There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet. Yet. What does "yet" mean, anyway? "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean? It means you're going to go, doesn't it? Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer. "Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind. Okay. Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash. I'm not snickering. I'm smiling. Because I'm happy. What do you mean, "what?" It's not my car, now is it? It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow. Fucking great. That's fucking great, Barry. We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each. Fantastic, Barry! What did you tell her about the shop for? I wanna live with a musician. She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes. But now I kind of like it. It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's. What did he ever do to you? Barry, I'm fucking broke! I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop. I don't want you talking to our customers like that again. Not the point. You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry. Nice, Barry. We'll do it next Monday. Since you brought that bullshit tape in. How can it be bullshit to state a preference? Say it. What's next? Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon. You should get out of bed earlier. I don't want old sad bastard music either. I just want something I can ignore. I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now. TURN IT OFF, BARRY. Haha. Right. It's no problem. I love making tapes. Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what? Why don't I just make you a tape? Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that. They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them. Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there. Instead of "Sin City." Who? Oh. My friend. My friend is Laura. A girl. A friend who's a girl. Yeah. Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it. So... I should really put a James Brown in there -- Sure, but is that it for the list? Is that it? Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone. A bit controversial, I know, but... Can I go home and work this out and let you know? In a week or so? What do you mean, four more? OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club. It's a country-rock ballad. Everybody'd go home. Oh boy... In the club, or at home? Pardon me? Yeah. I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it. What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young. You don't. You don't look old either. You look just as old as you are. A bit younger maybe, but not a lot. Not much. Just right. Huh. You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in. You must have only been about sixteen. Oh. Okay. Right. Why? Uh. That's me. May I help you? Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you? C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like. What the hell? Huh? Why did you break up with me for Marco? Hey Charlie. Uh...yes, at the moment. Yeah. A billion. Right... How are you? Yeah, sure... Who's that? What is this. Can I do anything? You're a horrible person, Barry. I mean it. Don't worry about it, Dick. Barry's an asshole. Yeah but more than that. I'm happy because I'm proud of us. Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage. I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux. -- FUCK OFF! Liz, hold on a second -- What? Let's not. I always hated this song. I understand, Dick. Fine. Yeah. I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up. She's gone. And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that. Hey. Didn't you steal that one already? What's this? Okay. Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one. No, that's okay. Really. Great. Good weekend? 'Morning, Dick. I dunno. We won't leave it, Ian. Not ever. I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck! Now get your patchouli stink out of my store. I dunno. Yeah. Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now. Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it. What needs sorting out? Can I help you? I'm an idiot. I should have played the record first. This place is about to get burned down. I dunno. Didn't think about it, really. It was the asking that was the important thing. Shut up. I'm only trying to explain. This stuff. Love and marriage. I want to think about something else. I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time. Fair enough. Are you persuadable? I don't know. Right. Okay, then. Shall we go? Would you marry me if I was? Not in love, exactly, but... Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch. I mean it. I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not. To me. I'm going to talk to you. Not really. I know. I don't get it. I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk. I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't. It's no joke. I'm responsible for what happens, you know. Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards. I have to put down a deposit for the room. I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them -- Barry? Barry knows about this? That's not the point. I mean, what if the single isn't done in time? You had no right. Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled? And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?" WHAT? Has Drag City Records, I know, I know. You told Dan Koretzky about this? You did that deliberately. You knew all along I'd like them. It was a trick. Ha. Oh. Well. We don't really get along. Paul and I. Where? Nothing. Hi. No use. You're being stupid. I'm alright. Harder. You're tougher. And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and... But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be? No, but... Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger. You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I. And I still do, and you don't. But it wasn't supposed to be like this. When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and... Fantastic. The Girlfriend Lottery. Hey, great idea. What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way. Okay. Oh, great... Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway? Oh, c'mon, Laura. Just say something. Lie, if you want. It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better. Okay, that's cool, okay. But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago? You know the difference. Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex? What it was like. C'mon. I want to know. Okay. Mission accomplished. What about Ian? So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split. But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together. Laura... Look, we can do other things. I didn't mean that. I mean... was that all you used? No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill? You know, with Ray... Hi. I've only got a couple left. I'm saving them for later. What? When are you going back? What do you want to do? Sure, I understand. Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time. You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus. What do you mean? I can see why you say that. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared. I just wanted you to know, that's all. Mmnn. Uh... No. Sure. I'll see you on Friday. Yes, of course. Do you want me to be there? Me? No, no. When are you going home? Who the fuck's Pig? Don't worry about it. Just get into bed. Worry about that when you're better. Are you alright? God, that's a cold and a half. Maybe you should bet back in bed. Guess who I just saw, right by my store? Ian. In Starbuck's. Neat, huh? Hey, how ya doin'? I guess I am. I got it. You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him. Okay, okay. I get the picture. Sure they are. Don't forget your CDs. You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it. You know I'm a good person. This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways. I hate him too. So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy." I'm sorry, but can we get this straight? What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray? What do you call him? I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you? I mean, how much are you making now? Sixty? Seventy? And you were living in this shitty place. That bad, eh? You still together? Going all right? It was kind of funny. Those look heavy. Where's Ian? Is that the last of it? No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it. I don't want to. Don't need to. I love you. Think about what I said. I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever -- Are you still in love with me? I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are. You're running. On the run. You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him. It's me. You do, huh. I don't have your number. Look, I gotta go. I work too, you know. Nothing. You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana? Maybe a Liz Phair track. There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff. The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you... But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there. Ah. Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan. Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings. He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing. I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth. I guess. No, not -- I mean have you, you know -- Have you slept with him yet? Great... That's great. Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home. I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk. I'll look for 'em. How you doing? Hi. The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet. But not even before, when he was living upstairs? Never? I don't know. Of course it is. Well. Sex, I guess. Is sex with him better? Is it better? You won't like it. It sounds stupid. No problem. If I can ask one question. Yeah. Great. Well if you could tell me roughly it would help. Hey, I just want to know where I stand. What chance -- So we have a chance of getting back together again. Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right? It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it? It means he might live. Even if it's only a remote possibility. So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me? There's still a chance we'll get back together? Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead? Why is that childish? Your living with the guy! I'm just asking how it's going. No. So. Is it working out with Ian? What, what? No. I don't know. Just the obvious stuff. I don't know. It's one of the things I thought of. Good. So. Is it my job? Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I? So. Where have you been staying for the last week? Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection? Not really. Yes. Look at me. Look at our -- the apartment. What else do I have, other than records and CDs? But Laura... that's me. That's all there is to me. There isn't anything else. If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything. So you weren't interested in music at all? You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it. You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection." But don't you remember? Hey! Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song! Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship! -- Alright, alright but -- -- Made. Made. Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in -- How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye? It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians. My house? Are you coming home? Hi. Shit! Jeez. He goes on long enough. Well stay for tonight, then. You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever. Only because it's never the time. I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know? I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered. Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo. But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself. And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know? Enough, Liz. Isn't that how it is for everybody? Is Ray going? You're kidding. A crematorium? Jesus. So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him? Well she -- It's true! What's the -- hey, Liz -- Actually, I'm fine. I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what? Maybe it is time to move on. Maybe we're just not right for each other. Or maybe we are. But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know? Yeah. I just wanted to thank you for that message last night. It made me feel like... like less of an asshole. What's happenin'. Rob here. I'll call you. That way. Which way are you going? Would you like me to turn the lights out? Or would you like them on? Yeah. I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it. Oh, right. Alright. I'd better go. I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'. Whiskey. I'm sure it isn't. Yes. You? Nor have you! Exactly! Fucking ex-actly! Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it? Books, records, films -- these things matter. Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life. What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers? Nobody's heard the Crumblers. Except me. Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like... I understand completely. You share a place with T-Bone? Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place? Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff? It's a great song. She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing. A relief, actually. Hi, Marie. No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well. So you live in Chicago now? Good. Mom! For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married! She is not that kind of girl! To use a phrase. That's not what happens now. It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at. Then what are you getting so upset about? Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out. I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed. Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work. Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it? I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you. Hello? Anybody there? She just called. She doesn't even know. It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice. That's weird, isn't it? You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno... How would I know? Gone. Girlfriend. Leave. Not say where gone. Laura move out. She left. She's gone. So so. Up and down. Great. Super-fantastic. Hi, Mom. Yeah? Oh, come on! Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care. Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you? I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else. Eleven-hundred. That's my lowest offer. Thirteen hundred. That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred? They're worth five times that. Look... I... I'm sorry. I don't want to be any part of this. Look. Can I pay you properly? You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest. Give it to charity. Or something. It must have taken him a long time to get them together. And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh? But you must have -- These are worth at least, I don't know -- It's the best collection I've ever seen. Nice. Whatever. We're not there yet, Justin. It's rough. But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio. I'll take care of the rest. I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys. Fuck off. Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it. Jesus. That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months! Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free. I can't frisk you but the cops can. I think you have more. Oh really. You two are slamming to Nico now? Eno import. Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats. Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here? Are you guys stealing for other people now?What's the name of your label? We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair. I'm Vince. Wait a minute. Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride. Records are those big round black things, right? No, we... Well we don't. Naw. Those are for us.
