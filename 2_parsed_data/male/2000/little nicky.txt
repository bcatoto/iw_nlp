Absolutely not. Is this a joke? Little Nicky. Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here. I hear a train coming. Drink. Of course I can. Drink or she dies. Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going. How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back. He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright. He's sick? You shouldn't have come here. No! I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear. You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan. Hello, Cassius. Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end. Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall? It's our time, brother. Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them... We could create our own hell there. What do you think about... Earth? Could you concentrate for five seconds? Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here. And he's dead serious. I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years. Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two. I'm calling you out, brother... Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello... Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity. It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool? Sure, why not? Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?That turn you on there, RuPaul? I can't screw. I can't screw. He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid. No. Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth. He superimposed your head onto "Scarface." I think you're looking at him. Look. You were really high. Things happen. The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look. Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind. I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores. You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you. "But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make? Go get a soda out of the fridge. You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers. Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil. I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown. Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking. Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet. You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about. Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it. It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy. Put it in your mouth. That pain is hunger. You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes. Makin' friends already. It's not me, moron. It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone. My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.Don't do it! Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open. You mother... All right. Let me out. Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us? I lowered the drinking age to ten. "Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one. ...their damned souls will be ours. You saying we go up there and kill everyone? I am concentrating. Where can we rule? That's what I thought! Yeah, get out of here! Beat it! It's just such a slap in the face. You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that. I knew it. He's finally retiring.Sure, pop. Whatever you want. Please, pop, just go back to your room. Everything's fine, pop. Now you're talking. Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that. In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino. I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline. Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here. I got no ears! I can't hear! No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go. Yes, Jimmy. Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle. Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting. That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you. You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth. You came through, Nicky. I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything! What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear... Please, Nicky, get back up there. Try to hurry. That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them. Son, just do your best. Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here. I'm too weak. The process has already begun. To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way. I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing. This is bad, Nicky. And I also happen to be a Jets fan. I was just playing with you. Who is this, Metal-lick-a? I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next? Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time. The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time. Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me. This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so... Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later. Now everybody sit down. Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?This is bullshit, man. I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you! You did it for Namath. C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.Bus? You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this? Thanks. Hey. That's what I'm thinkin'... I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right? That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing? What was it called, sir. It's Stanley, sir. I know, your wickedness.He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky. You get your ass back up there. You save your father! Check one-two. Check one-two. Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears! Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock. Knock, knock. You were gone ten seconds. What happened? You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you. I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers. Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock. Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.You want a queen? Got one right here. Urr... uggg... errr... Uh. No it won't? And give you a good buzz. Weed lowers the body temperature. I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine. But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what? Noon... Of course you do, Tommy Tune. Easy, Liberace. By she, do you mean he? No wonder your uncle's so weird... Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this? Schnapps... Looking for the chief. Little nervous. Wanna puke. That's a big pass, Elton John. Six, six, six, pick up sticks. The Dark Prince is here. Yeah. You do it. Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off. What's with that guy? There's our man. 'Bout time... Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on. Come on. One more time. What's Ozzy trying to say there? That way.Can I take him with me and have sex with his head? Last time you said that the renaissance happened. What's with all the whoo-whoo noises? I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything... Boogerland! Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell. You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius? I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup. You know, I was the one who created Hell.Now will you get in the flask? No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got. Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask. Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay? Let her go. Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him. Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies. Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick. Please, get out of my mind! ADRIAN! Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane. Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would it be okay if I called you Mommy? What is it? A speech impediment? But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me. I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody. Valerie's crying! How did you see me? Well tell her I said "hi" back. Where did you meet my father? How come you're not older? Wow. What... what did she look like? An angel? My mom wasn't a goat? My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis. The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks... This is baloney! I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him. I didn't murder anybody I seem to be in trouble, Beefy. We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass. Release the evil? But those are my roommate's sodas... Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked. What can I do about it? All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early. Well, let's rock and roll. Okay, just point me in the right direction next time. This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people! Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing? From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects. I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking! Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'! So far, so good. Now what? I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling... It's freezing up here, Beefy. Oh. Sorry. Okay, "bro," this jig is up... Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there. I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy. I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home... What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell? I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad. Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me? Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do? Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one. No. This can't be happening. Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers? So go get 'em, Dad! How bad? You're a good devil, Dad. Metallica, Dad. Come on. Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester. Definitely. I mean... tough break. Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool. Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece. Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture. Beast. You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this? That's a pretty brassiere. Coulda been much worse. I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal. I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house! You're not saying it's up to me? So go get 'em, Jimmy! We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas? Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'! Hey... See ya, fellas. No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves. Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts. Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one. Which way did he go? I'll just go to Heaven. Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you. Good idea... kill me. I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here! All right... Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie? Adrian? Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking. No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts. You smell like coconuts. I love you. Do me. From my dad's side of the family. That was Cassius! I have to, Valerie. I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead. Please tell me you like metal. East Rutherford. Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine. You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies. ...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you. Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad... Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell? That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig. I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice. I think I'm floating. No. Valerie? I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison. Hey. I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that... Your juicy, heart-shaped ass. Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie? Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles. So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store? Good. I was concerned. Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal? What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin? School? I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts. I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though. It's freezing my hands. Uh, it's a deep south expression. Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back! Could I come with you to getting a Gelati? Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'. If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do. My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart. I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them. Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why. The South. You think I'm a tourist? That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that. That just hurt a lot. A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie. If it's Cassius, yes. It looks like the work of a brother... I don't know. Yeah. The deep South. No. Off limits. Yes. What is rent? Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot? Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten. I don't know? No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask. Yes. I would like my flask back. Hey...This don't look good. Peppermint... alright. We know where to find Nicky. You sure you're down with this? We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky? Look who's back from the dead. Did you check out the dragon mouth? Should we wake him up? Gotta be one of his disciples or something. Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side. Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time. You gotta kill yourself. Dude. Seriously? Dude, it's us. Let us in. Please. You got to.I was DeNiro! Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES? I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat. So I followed him... So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch! And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief? You callin' me a thief, my man? See something you like, my man?You got the wrong window again, man. Andrew. I don't need luck. I'm good. Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over. It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in? Hello.Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit. They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke. Where is he? He's late. Did you just talk? What's Nicky doing down there? His name is Andrew. I know that guy. Oh, would you grow up. No. I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that. I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny. I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it? Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on? A black guy? And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed. Why is that funny? It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South? Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. Aren't you boiling in that outfit? Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits. Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
