Thank you Father Macklepenny, for  coming all the way across town to be  our guest speaker today. I hope you  found our little parish to your  liking. ...and I am reminded of this holy  day of the sad story of Kitty  Geneviese. This poor soul cried out  time and time again for help but no  person answered her calls. Though  many saw, not one so much as called.  Her assailant wiped the bloody knife  off on her lifeless little body.  They watched as he simply walked  away. Nobody wanted to get involved.  Nobody wanted to take a stand... We  must fear evil men and deal with  them accordingly but what we must  truly guard against, what we must  fear most Is the indifference of good men. I do believe the Monsignor finally  got a point. Aye. What? Aye. Pleased ta meet ya Rozie. Okay then... let's get ya started. Christ, that's the largest woman  I've ever seen. Well, how politically correct you  are. That's good stuff. Well, as long as we're hirin' fat  lesbians, give your ma a call. Okay, just cut off as much fat as  you can as it goes by and the rule  of thumb here is... Yeah? Can't do much damage with that.  Perhaps, it shoulda been the rule of  wrist. Ha! Rule of wrist. Hey Murphy? Aye. How many feminists does it take to  screw in a light bulb? How many? Two. One ta screw it in and one ta  suck my cock. Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was  just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya. Yeah. Just tryin' ta break the ice  is all. Oh, come on its St. Patty's Day.  It's all in good fun. Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry.  Just relax. Why don't you save all your aggression  for protests and marches and what  not. Guess you'll have ta change that  tattoo now, won't ya Rozie!? Fuck you. Hello. Mother, is that you? Ma, what's wrong? No fuckin' hot water man. That... Shut it. It's Ma. Mother, what are you sayin'? You're  talkin' crazy here. What's the matter with her? What the hell are you doin' with  Da's gun!? What the...? What?! What are you doin'? Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it  woman?! Now just calm down here. Oh my god! No ma! No! Oh Jesus, No! No! Oh God! No Ma! Aaaww, shit!... evil woman! Lord have mercy. That was a good one  ma. Oh, she's quite proud of herself. All right, we're both here. Just called ta torture us did ya? How's Uncle Sibeal? Well you tell him ta take it easy  with that. He's gotta learn ta respect  women the way Connor does. Oh, Jesus. I gave him his first lesson in  sensitivity toward the fairer sex  just today. Don't even do it, ya bastard. He got beat up by a girl. If that was a girl I want ta see  some papers. She had ta be just  preoperative for Christ sakes. Mother Mary, full of grace. Well, we tried ta make friends and  she gave me a shot ta the nuts. Well, I didn't but... Don't worry, I respected the hell  out of her for ya, Ma. Yes mother. We promise. Yeah, we promise. All right, love ya ma. Listen, before  ya go just give us the goods, eh? Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years. Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came  out first? Aye. Crazy woman. Don't start. I've had ice on mine. Listen, I gotta go by the numbers on  this one. I.D. just came back on  these guys. They've got connections  to the Russian mob. That makes it a  federal matter and Agent Smecker,  here, is heading up the investigation  with our full cooperation. What the fuck? Yes sir. I got the best ballistics guy in the  world. He's mobile. Got all his stuff  right in the van. Can have him down  here in 10 minutes. Agent Smecker, This is all illegal loft housing so  there's no manager on the premises  but I found a lady on the fourth  floor said she's had water dripping  down on her whole place. Started  just this morning. So what are you thinkin' here? Agent Smecker. I know this  neighborhood pretty good. There's a  bar called McGinty's down the block.  It's a good bet they were there last  night. Hey, Duffy. What the fuck happened  here? You owe me. This is the one I  want. Let's go get a cup of coffee. You  ain't gonna fuckin' believe this  one. Okay. Just calm down. Take it easy.  He'll have his day. He'll have his Thanks for comin', Doc. J-Jesus. What the fuck happened? Are  ya b-boys all right? We're alive. An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He  left me his c-c, he left me his c-c,  he left me this. Fuck!..........Ass! What are you going to do? We're going to turn ourselves in. It  was self defense. y-y-yeah that's what he said. How the fuck's he know that? We  haven't spoken to anyone yet. Don't know. He didn't say. Listen Doc, we need a favor. A-anything. Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be  comin back for it when we get out. Right. What makes you think they're  dangerous? They were just protecting  each other. No help at all. Swamped from St.  Patty's. Packed with drunk, bloody  Irish. You'd probably have better luck with  a beer. Excuse me, sir. "What do we tell him about the guns  and money?" "We just got up and left. Bum musta  rolled them before the police got  there." Okay. We're ready. We... met them last night. Would someone please come over here  and... Fuck! me up the... Ass! Hey! Fuck! Ass! Get me a beer! ...It's not that I'm homophobic. I'm  just afraid of faggots. I got some bad news. Looks like I'm  gonna have ta close d-down the bar.  The Russians have been buying up  buildings all over town, including  this one... Fuck!... Ass! And they're  not letting me renew my lease. I got  'til the end of the week to come up  with 26,000 dollars, or they take  the place. I left them a note telling  them not to show their faces t- tonight. They been pressuring me ta  close and take the last few days ta  get all my shit outta here but it's  my right to stay open ta the last. Let me talk to my boss, may I can... L-l-listen I don't want anyone ta  know until the last possible moment.  So you guys keep your traps shut. ya  know what they say; People in glass  houses sink ships. Y'know Doc, I gotta get you a, a,  like a proverb book or something.  This mix and match shit's gotta go. What? A p-penny saved is worth two in the  bush. Don't c-cross the road if ya can't  get out of the kitchen. This is McCoy... we find Spock and  we got enough for an away team. Why don't you make like a tree and  get the fuck outta here! Calm down, Doc. I'm sure they're  reasonable fellows. Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til  this week's end. Ya don't have ta be  hard asses, do ya? Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's  Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya  pull up a stool and have a drink  with us? If ya want a fight, you can see you're  outnumbered. We're trying ta be civil  here, so I suggest you take our offer. Hey, there Boris. What would you say  if I told you that your pinko, commie  mother sucked so much dick... "Now, that wasn't too polite, was  it?" "I'm afraid we can't let that one  go, Ivan." I don't think Ma would mind. Let the boy go. He knows what the  fuck he's doing! Nicely done, boy! Now, like my fine brother says, on  St. Patty's everyone's Irish. And  this piece of shit is about to be  initiated. Are ya tryin' ta kill him, ya fuck? It was just a bar fight. You guys  are fuckin' pussies! We paid attention in school. Aye. Our mother insisted on it.  French. How do you think he figured all this  out without talking to us? Italian. I have no idea. Maybe someone saw  and talked. German. Not in our neighborhood, man. A  hundred percent Irish. No one talks  to cops. Period. Spanish. Then I guess he's just real... real  good. Absolutely not. No pictures, either. Our mother can see through bags. Aye, she can.  Any way we can stay here? He's a nice guy. Yes... he is. This is our official statement. The  MacManus brothers are not being  charged with a crime. It was a clean- cut case of self defense. We have  thanked them for their cooperation  and we thank you, the media, for  your tireless pursuit of the truth. Destroy all that which is evil... ...so that which is good may flourish Be right back... We would be honored, sir, if you  would join us peasants, in a donut. Saints?   I will not accept this pizzle until  my feet have been properly anointed. Well, it's the funny man. Give it  here, package boy. Joey Bevo said it was important.  Said I had to give it to him myself. Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the  fuck down! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee  Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee. Fuck you Vincenzo. Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee. I caught your show down at the velvet  room at the Holiday Inn, loved it  when you busted into Viva Las Vegas. Hey, hey, hey... Poppa Joe, you want me to go now? Yeah boss? The... The funny man. Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one  about the, no fuck that one... uh...  oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's  a white guy. He's walkin' along the  beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know  and ah, he rubs it and this genie  pops out. But this genie, he's a  ni... he's a black guy. Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He  says, "Why you crackers always gotta  find my mother fuckin' pot? And he  tells him he's gonna grant all his  three wishes but he's gonna give all  the black guys... Niggers! Sorry! Sorry! All the niggers on the  planet get double what he wishes  for. "I'll take a million dollars,"  he says. Genie give it to him and  says every nigger on earth just got  two million. "I don't care gimme a  yacht." Poof there it is. E-every bl... every nigger just got  two yachts. Genie goes... I'm sorry Poppa Joe. I can't. This  joke sucks. He says, "What's your third wish?"  And the guys says, "I-I want you to  beat me half to death." Know what we need, man?... some rope. For what? Charlie Bronson's always got rope. What? Yeah, these guys always got a lot of  rope strapped around em in the movies  and they always end up using it. Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya? I'm serious. Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing  we're gonna need it for. I don't know they just always need  it. What is all this "they" shit? This  ain't a movie. Is that right, Rambo? All right, get the stupid fuckin'  rope. I was just trying to cuddle. These guys were pros. I think they  were coming for one target, the fag  man, he was the... The fat man. He was the only one done right. Two  in the back of the head. New hitman wants to leave his mark Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies  in the eyes of the dead, or silver. The Sicilians. They shot him at a downward angle. They put him on his knees. What about one guy with two guns? It's gonna look like the bad guys  are killing each other. This better be good.  Talk! Nervous? A bit. Me, too. You and your fucking rope. See. I told you there'd be a shaft. Just like on TV. Where the fuck are you going? We'll find it. Just calm down. No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit.  I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin'  this stupid thing around. Must weigh  30 pounds. We're doing some serious shit here.  Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole. Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin'  Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's  getting' us lost! Sh, sh! Fuck you! No, fuck you! And shepherds we shall be. For thee,  my Lord, for thee. Power hath  descended forth from thy hand that  our feet may swiftly carry out thy  command. So we shall flow a river  forth to thee and teeming with souls  shall it ever be. E nomini patri, et  Fili e spiritu sancti. That was some good fuckin' rope. That was way easier than I thought. Aye. On TV ya always get that asshole  that jumps behind the couch. Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for  ten minutes. Oh, we're good man. Yes, we are. I love our new job. Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the  same side! The boss musta sent you  in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please!  I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. They call me the funny fuckin' man! Where's your gun? Chest pocket.  Shit! This is a six-shooter. Nine bodies. Oh, you're good. What were you gonna  do? Laugh the last three to death,  funny man? Poppa Joe said there was only two.  In and out. Boy, you guys sure did a good job.  You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd  you get them? Let's do him right here. Right now. Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no.  I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the  funny man... the funny. What did you do?! Fuckin'... what  the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked  this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two  fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!! Certainly illustrates the diversity  of the word. What the fuck are you doing here?  What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! Get a hold of yourself, man. Yeah, get a hold of yourself. Listen, we gotta get outta here now.  We'll take separate exits and meet  at Rocco's. Fuck! Anybody you think is evil? Yes. Don't you think that's a little  psycho? A little weird? Weird, huh?... Know what I think is  weird? Decent men with loving families  go home every day after work. They  turn on the news and see rapists,  murderers, and child molesters all  getting out of prison. Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos  and walkin' on bail the same day. Little girls catchin' stray bullets  in their heads, playin' hopscotch in  their front yards. And everyone thinks  the same thing... Someone should  just go kill those motherfuckers. Kill em all. Admit it, even you've  thought about it. You guys should be in every major  city. This is some heavy shit. This is  like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it!  There's so much shit that pisses me  off. You guys should recruit 'cause  I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin'  down the street waitin' for one of  these assholes to get me, y'know? Hallelujah, Jaffar. So you're not just talkin' mob guys.  You're talkin' anyone, right? Even  like pimps and drug dealers and all  that shit? Well fuck, you guys could do this  every day. We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always  doing business, but we're always  open. Nicely put. You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm  fuckin' done. Permanent package boy. Who says that? You could take credit  on it. What are you serious? Yeah, fuck it. If you think about  it, it's all you can do really. You  can't tell him it was us. Go in  braggin' and shit. Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don  Rocco. Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it.  I've been working for those fat  bastards since I was in high school  and look at this place. They're fuckin' me man! Hey, they  can suck my pathetic little dick.  And I'll dip my nuts in marinara  just so the fat fucks can get a taste  of home while they're at it. That's  it, it's done, I'm doing it. I can't fuckin' believe that just  happened! Donna's gonna be angry about her  cat. Shit. She's on every drug know to  man. She'd have sold that thing for  a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole. You sound real remorseful. She ain't been around in weeks anyhow. Listen. Something's been bothering  me about last night. What? Well... what if your boss knew how  many guys were supposed to be there...  in that room? What are you saying? Think about it man. Nine men, six  bullets. You think they sold me out? No way. He probably knew you'd end up nailing  the fat guy, maybe one or two more,  but he had to know you weren't walking  out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's  dead on the scene. No in-depth  investigation. It'd slide right off  his back. 'Cause as much as I love  ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone.  What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy? No, no. That's just not the way things  are done. Besides, how's he know I  don't just get in there see there's  too many and just serve em their  fuckin' food and beat it? He knows you, man. He knows all you  want is to move up. That's all. A  smooth hitter woulda gone in there,  seen it was a wash and slipped out.  But a guy like you? Knowin' this is  your only chance? Waitin' eighteen  years? No. No man. That's... that's... you  don't know what you're talking about.  That's bullshit. I know these guys.  I mean, thanks for your concern, but  that just ain't the thing of it. Do me a favor and roll it around for  a bit on your way in. No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs  to be rolled. Where are you goin'? Did you tell him? Yes. Then what the fuck? Hey. You don't know that shit for  sure. Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin'  retard! Fuck you! Use your brain for once. Is it so  unbelievable they don't care about  you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in  there today. Dead! Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know  what's going on, huh? Fuck you! Hey, this ain't a thing you should  gamble on, Roc. Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya  want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop.  This is the last time I'll see you.  Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch. I'll be back at 9:00. Hey. You get in there and start  getting a bad vibe, get the fuck out  quick. Hello? Hey Murph. Roc. You okay? Yeah. Anybody call for me? No. You sure you're okay? I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side. Fuck this job. I'm getting out of  the porno business and I don't care  who I gotta blow to do it. No way they could have seen it? Jesus. I just can't think anymore.  That scene over at the coffee shop  today tapped me out. A guy went nuts over off of  Commonwealth today. Shot three guys  to death in a coffee shop in broad  daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have  much on him. Crime of passion. He just went nuts.  He would have shot everyone in here.  He just ran out of bullets. Well, we didn't get any help on that.  A lot of people saw it. Nobody's  talking. Hello? Hey, Murph. Roc. You okay? Yeah. Anybody call for me? No. You sure you're okay? I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side. Pack your shit! We gotta get outta  here! We gotta get out! What happened? I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em  all!! Hey, hey. Just calm down. Tell us  what happened! No! Fuck you! You start getting  excited! We gotta fucking go! Who did you kill? Holy shit. Who? How many? Hurry the fuck up! This is some crazy shit, man! Those cocksuckers sold me out! Did I fuckin' tell ya, Rocco? They  pull on you first? What did I fuckin' do?... in the  middle of the Lakeview. Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit! Ha! Ha! Roc, you got a jumbo set of  coconut balls man! What? I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie  bitch! I felt it would bring closure to our  relationship! Your what?! Your fuckin' what?! Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself  in the head, you can tell me that  cats name! Go ahead... Your what?  Your precious little... Peeperman? WRONG? What color was  it?!!! Male or female, bitch?!! Don't you yell at her you fuckin'  prick! Shut your fat ass, Rayvie! I can't  buy a pack of smokes without running  into nine guys you fucked. All right, let's get the fuck outta  here! Is my... I mean it's not really...? Those rat fucks! All of them were  all laughing at me man! You sure you killed them? Fuckin-A-right I did. I had a goddam  turkey shoot over there. I'll bet it was a test. Vincenzo  came in here shooting his mouth off.  He was makin' sure we knew. But we  did what we were supposed to, eh? We  kept our mouths shut. You did your  part. They know we're goodfellas  now. We'll get taken care of. What? Did everyone know? Next thing  you'll tell me Sal was in on it. Anybody see ya? Fuck, man! I may as well have posted  flyers. Right out in public, man. Liberating isn't it? Y'know it is, a bit. Stop the car! Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker,  Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one  who set me up. Then he went around  shooting his mouth off, telling  everyone I was as good as dead. He  goes in there every Wednesday night  around 10:00, he jerks off in the  same booth to the same titty dancer.  Never misses. So? So let's kill the motherfucker. I  mean, what are you guys... like that's  your new thing right? Yeah, well... Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys  decide who you're... I mean, who  makes the cut? Is there a raffle or  something? Well, truth be known, those first  ones just kinda fell into our laps. Well, what'ya do? I guess we really don't have a system  of deciding who. MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know  everyone, their habits, where they  hang out, who they talk to. I know  where they fuckin' live. We could  kill everyone! So what do you think? I'm strangely comfortable with it. Okay Roc, this is... What? You guys got masks. You look like Mush Mouth from Fat  Albert. Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she  can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin'  to be professional, but no... No. No. It looks good. C'mon, put it  back on. It's good. Okay Roc. You sure you're O-B-kay-B? Which one is he in? What's his routine? H... h... he jerks off in there.  Th... then he puts money through the  slot and I raise the door. How? Then what? He watches me do my thing and f- finishes himself off. Don't you talk to me like that, you  dirty little... give it to daddy...  give it ta da King... garbage mouth,  garbage mouth. Oh man. He is some sicko. You've earned this. What the fuck are you doing? I-I'll tip her. We've teamed up with a sex offender. So, when are you getting a plastic  fuck doll? All right. I'm sorry. I'm pathetic. What? What is it? This place is like a scumbag yard  sale. We gotta come down here once a week  and clean house. You sure about this guy? Oh man. You gotta let me do these  guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make  up for the tit thing. No way. I've been waitin' for this  asshole. Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family  name here. I've brought shame to the  house of Della Rocco. Give the guy a shot. Rocco, this is the real deal. We  must kill without hesitation, without  guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead  man. Wyatt-fuckin'-Earp, man! You guys gotta teach me that prayer,  man. That's some good shit. Forget it. It's a family prayer. My  father, his father before him that  sort of shit. C'mon! Fuck you. I bounced you on my knee at family  reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad  and me ran the whole east coast  syndicate you snot-nosed little prick.  And when you took the wheel, who was  beside you? Don't start with your shit. Don't  you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy,  thanks for years of service. Here's  a gold watch and a job sniffing other  guys' shit eight hours a day. What  am I, a retired bus driver? The Duke?  What did you do? Listen kid, I think you better  understand who you're dealing with  here. Your dad and I used him three times  over twenty years, only when  everything went totally fucked.  Believe me kid, you don't want this  guy unless you are 100% sure you  need him. He is... a fuckin' monster. Do you feel you have been  rehabilitated? I've had this guy in front of me,  and I couldn't tell you what he looks  like, sounds like. He is the Picasso  of assassins, kid. He plants hair  samples, blood. Puts skin under  fingernails. He is a fucking genius.  Only one problem. He's been rotting  in prison for twenty-five or thirty  years. Don't even know if he's still  alive. Or if he's even up to it. Go find one. Let's talk some business here. I  know a sick fuck... makes the ones  we been doing look like altar boys.  Worst night of my life when I met  this guy. The guy never says a fuckin' word to  me. We're driving for 25 minutes.  Never a sigh, no throat clearing,  nothing. And his face, blank man.  Just nothing there. I didn't see what he was doing while  he was in there. I have a poker game at the house  every Saturday with a couple of guys  you know. Why don't you come down?  Wife makes a hell of a bar-g-que. Yeah... yeah, I'd like that. Tell me  something. What did they do? I don't know. Worst day of my life, man. Well, I'm sold. Don't worry, Roc. We'll do this guy  right and you'll feel a lot better. Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know  you fuckin' know! Fuck you! I told you I never saw him  before! Well he sure as fuck knew you! Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was  aiming at you! There he goes. Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to  bring this man into the light? Are  we ready to truly do the work of the  Lord? A-fuckin'-men! This is so fuckin' cool! Don't fuck with me lady. I'll kill  you. All of them. Shit!... Shit! He ain't here. What the fuck do you mean? I mean he ain't here. Look again for fuck sake! I know what the fuck he looks like! Let the boy go! C'mon Roc! Help me you assholes!  He's gonna fuckin' kill me! I don't wanna die!!!!! No!... No! No!... What? That's it?! Shit. What? What, that guy? That's the guy that got us off the  hook with the "Checkov" thing. And he is one smart man. They got nothing. This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't  figured us out yet, he will. You bet your ass he will. Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility. He isn't to be touched. He's a good man. Okay... whatever. My Mom's gonna kill me. You've had quite a bit, Paul. Are  you sure you... Hey! We gotta talk about this early  morning church shit. We have to go now. We're on the lamb. You gonna do what I say, got it? Yes. I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see  this. Don't look at me! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Don't do this my son. Open it! Have you no fear of God? That's who I'm doing this for, now  open the fuckin' thing. Father, I'll do you right here. God have mercy on my soul. You little fuck. Let him go. I'll  drop you right here. Okay, just calm down. He could hurt  us, brother. He could ruin the whole  thing. Let him go or I will deliver you,  right now. You won't do it Connor, you won't.  You love me man. Y-Yes my son. Do your thing Father. Don't fuck  this up. What do you want me to say? Just be natural, goddamit. How long since your last confession,  my son? Why have you come to a church for  council if you're not religious? What is it my son? God's permission? God doesn't... You believe? You feel? You feel? A soul is what gives you  feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or  wrong. It is a conduit through which  the Lord speaks to us. You felt that  your answers would be here in the  house of God today. You feel these  men are necessary. The Lord has spoken  to you twice this day. You have entered the house of the  Lord of your own free will speaking  of beliefs and feelings. Is it so  much to believe that God has brought  you here? It is easy to be sarcastic about  religion. It is harder to take small  hints from God, your feelings and  listen to them... to take a stand. Those who do not act are in a constant  state of ethical indecision. Then you must find out what your  beliefs are. You know them personally? Do you think they would harm an  innocent man, for any reason? Goddam right, I am. The laws of God are higher than the  laws of man. Forgive me father. I wouldn't have, uh, killed you,  Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're  bound. You can't talk about this...  to anyone. Just go! The Lord works in mysterious ways. Well, the light caught the side of  his face for a second. And it looked  like he had a gray beard, maybe...  late fifties, early sixties. I think it's better if we find this  man before he finds us again. We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight,  right in the comfort of his own home.  Then we move on to New York. It's  getting a bit hot for us here. I'll call you tonight, afterwards. I don't know who he is. Nobody does. Needed an outsider. The package boy  knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters  a mile away. Well he's the one shooting up all  his guys, right? He's scared of the  kid. Says he's real good, got every  available gun in the city up there. Up his house. I don't know what's  going on but I know it's gotta have  something to do with this kid. I know Rocco. He ain't smart enough  for this shit. These other guys are  the brains. He's just a player. You guys? We're here brother. You gotta keep going. We'll keep going, Roc. You'll make it outta here. You can't  ever stop, not ever. Once you set him in motion, you can't  call him off. He thinks it's still  on. What? I... Why don't you take the front. You guys cover those other exits and  if you see him, don't flag him down,  just kill the mother fucker. I'm  going back down to work on these  pricks. What the fuck? If I die cause you're getting a piece  of ass, I'll come back and beat you  to death with a big rubber dick. How far are we going with this, Da? The questions is not, "how far?" The  question is, "Do you possess the  constitution, the depth of faith to  go as far as is needed?" Look at his charisma. He's the next  John Gotti. He'll walk. Even with all this  evidence. Look. All Yakavetta's people are on the  right. All the families of the men  he has killed are on the left.  Everyone wants some justice. Look at him. He doesn't have a care  in the world. He's gonna walk. How long do these put a man down  for? Ten minutes. Twenty is a bit better. Due to the lack of hard evidence...... All media to the back! Drop the  cameras! Drop 'em! You people have been chosen to reveal  our existence to the world. You will  witness what happens here today and  you will tell of it afterwards. You must watch dear. It'll all be  over soon. Now, you will receive us. We do not ask for your poor or your  hungry. We do not want your tired and sick. It is your corrupt we claim. It is your evil, who will be sought  by us. With every breath we shall hunt them  down. Each day we will spill their blood  till it rains down from the skies. Do not kill, do not rape, do not  steal. These are principles which  every man of every faith can embrace. These are not polite suggestions.  They are codes of behavior and those  that ignore them will pay the dearest  cost. There are varying degrees of evil.  We urge you lesser forms of filth Not to push the bounds and cross  over into true corruption... into  our domain. For if you do, there will come the  day when you look behind you and see  we three. And on that day you will  reap it. And we will send you to whatever God  you wish. Yes! Were you in the courtroom miss?  Did you see? How do you feel about what they did?
