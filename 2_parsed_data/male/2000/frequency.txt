Oh, my God! What is that?! Why you showing me this shit!? JESUS! JESUS! Get those away from me! Nothing. So what? What I know is what I told you. No, I don't. What are you saying? Yeah. That was over thirty years ago. I paid for that and then some.No, I think he's up in interrogation. Just missed Deleon. Hayes is up in the squad. That's Deleon and Hayes' collar. Yeah.How do we get to the vault door? We gotta go underground. Get those guys out, now. You're shitting me! Why haven't they killed the juice? Elvis has left the building. Then fuckin' find it. I'm going for the girl. One way to find out. It looks open on the other side. I'm alright, Gibby. Stay with me, Gib. We're gonna do this. Hey, Rookie. Be cool. Just stay with me. This is what we do. The game, Graham. The Series? Oh, man. Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow. Hey, bud. I gotcha, I gotcha Chief! Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy... Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody... I'm on with John - that guy I told you about. I'm serious. No. Not our Johnny. I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future. I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio. I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he... There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about. Wish you weren't. He ain't the only one. I love you, Bud. One in each ear. What would you do without me? I tucked him in at Gordo's. Nothing. I just wanted to see you. Sure. It was under control, Bud. Butchy's just getting tight in his old age. Did he? The usual. I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time. What's the matter, Jules? Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese? You alright? How about a little of the King? Hey, bud. Next time lets put some money on it. No kidding. I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW. Come get me. Satch, you gotta listen to me... In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run. Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th. The Mets are gonna win 5-3. Go watch the game, Satch. The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park. What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0. And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball. What if I could prove it to you, Satch? He's not gonna stop, Satch. He's gonna keep on... Satch, would you listen to me here. Just you and me. Can I talk to you here, alone? As nuts as that sounds, yes. I swear, Satch. Okay, okay. I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio. No. This isn't what you think. What do you mean? About what? No, I don't. What is going on here, Satch? What are those guys doing out there? Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John. You hear me? Satch is here. John, hold on a second. I'm in the middle of something important here. You mind if... Okay, I'm on it. Hey. Luck, my ass. Yes! That's it! You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief! I'm right here behind you... You ready? No, but we can. We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief. Don't be scared. This time I'm right behind you if you fall. I'll be up soon, Little Chief. C'mon, Chief, show some guts. Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling. Okay, start pedaling. Glad to hear that. Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief. What's wrong? We did it, John. We stopped him. Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder. John... John, you there? Just a minute, John...okay? Don't go away. What are you doing here, Satch? You off today? You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one? Hang on. Huh? I got it. Okay, okay... What... How the hell am I gonna do that? What? In my pocket. No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license. He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live. John, he's got my driver's license. Johnny, I know, but... I don't think I can. I'm not a cop. I can't. I can't stop this guy. This is wrong...it's like we cheated... Yes it is...we did this. We changed everything. I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire. I was supposed to die in that warehouse. He killed her John. He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it. Don't worry, Chief. I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what. You all right? John, you still there? John, say hello to my wife...Julia. Hang on a sec, John. Wow. Yeah, you betcha. Hey, what about the Amazin's? They pull it off? What are we like in...1998? What else, John. It must be different, huh? Are people living on the moon? Tell me something good, Chief. Tell me about the future. All right, I'm with you. I just hope we know what the hell we're doing. How? Got it. Whatta we do now? No. I just kept talking to her. There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em. I'll be damned. What do I tell them? Why not just get the cops to watch the bar? What if the radio stops working? Christ, what if I can't reach you again? I don't know, John. I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different. So what should I do? Call the police? You think they'll believe me? What can we do? You don't even know who this guy is. I'll warn them. I gotta take her away, John. I'm gonna take your mother away. He can't hurt her if I take her away. What are you talking about? Whatta you mean... What kinda twisted animal. Murdered? Why? Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now. How? When? She just died, your mother just died? Whatta you mean she's not here? What? What is it? What? Johnny, what's wrong? Are you alright"? Right here, Chief. Sorry I lost you last night. Damn thing keeps cutting out. What, Johnny? What is it? I'm glad. Tell me. Yeah. I'm okay. What about you? I want to know. About you. And your mom. You're the voice of an angel, Johnny. If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it. Chief?! Is that you? I don't understand. But that's tomorrow. When? That can't be...that's not gonna happen. On the job? Why? What? What are you talking about? It's okay. I'm still here, Chief. I think I'm losing you. You're still my Little Chief, right? Too busy playin' ball, huh? It's really you, isn't it? 1998...? This is wrong. Who are you? Why are you doing this? Thirty-five? That would make it... You sound...ground up...? Yeah, that's how Hams work. We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time. How could this be happening? Johnny...? That's impossible. What's happening? What? Nothing...I just spilled something. I'm not dreaming. What the hell... 29 years...? What? W...B...2...YXB. What the hell does Gordy have to do with it? Right...and I'm asking how you called the game. Look pal, I'm just askin' how you... Frank...Frank Sullivan. Uh huh... Oh, that was my kid. Sorry 'bout that. What are you talking about? I'm talking about this afternoon. The World Series. You called Buford's homer. I been Q-ing you all night. How the hell did you do it? ...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens. CQ 15. I'm right with you, man. He's got the heart of a lion. Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series? Fed up? Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball. What? Sorry 'bout that. So Queens, you psyched for the Series? 15-band closes down at night. During the day you can chew the band with China if you want. Whatta ya know. Bayside, born and raised. Where are you transmitting from? Listen, you can't broadcast without a license. Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band. Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy? WB2YKXB, who've I got?You okay, man? Gotta be another way up, Frank. Don't know what's behind it. Frank. Hey, man. You alright? I should'a been a fucking mailman. Frank. We gotta go back. Frank... I seem nervous, huh? Oh, yeah. Damn. My watch is busted. Baltimore?You got a deal, mister. I mean Santa. I better give you my address then. How'd you know my name, mister? This is the Space Cowboy. I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth. Huh? Yeah, lung cancer. Ten years ago. Fire? What are you talking about? He had cancer, John. Huh? What? John. John, you all right? How you feeling? I know pal. I remember. Twenty-nine years tomorrow. Go in where? C'mon, man. Get inside. I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo. Sull! What the hell! Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear? Hey, Sull. My cable's out again. Sully! Is that you?Nicky Moore. Patty Ryan. Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole? Julia Sullivan! She mean anything? She means something to me! So, what'd you do about it, Daryl? Let me tell you what I know, Daryl. You went to Saint Xavier with Mary. You lived five blocks from her. You liked her. But she ain't interested. That must've hurt, huh? Sexual assault, Daryl. Five years. But you got lucky, right? You got away with something else. Something you figured nobody knows about. Well, I think you do. You know what I'm saying. You remember Mary Finelli? You go to Xavier High School, Daryl? I don't remember. Why don't I remember? Wait. Something's wrong. I don't... I'm here, Dad. I'm here. Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on? Dad, what the hell is going on? Dad, you there? Call the FBI. Use a pay phone. Don't give 'em your name, Dad. Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others. That he's the Nightingale. It's gonna work, Dad. We're gonna stop him. Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep. Please, Dad, just do it. Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners. His prints. You've got his prints. I'll run them through criminal index. You gotta get me that wallet. We got him! Dad you got him! He touched your wallet! Where's your wallet? He took your wallet? What? I need you to believe in me. To believe that we can do this. But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember? I know... But Dad, you can't go back. You didn't die in that fire. And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that. So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right. No. It's not your fault, Dad. Yeah, I think so... I'm right here, Dad. H-hi. You there? Well, game five was the big one. It turned in the bottom of the 6th. We were down 3-0. Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up. The count goes to 2 2. High fastball. He nailed it. Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th. We won, Pop. You really wanna know? We're okay...we're good, Dad. Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here. Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer. Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli. Girl disappeared in '68. Turns out she was his first kill. Which means he probably knew her. Most serials know their first victim. I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together... Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard. Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C. Tomorrow. She's a nursing student. Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd. Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five. It's okay. This is working. This is gonna work. Did you see him? Do you know who he is? Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be. They'll question her. Whatever they tell her could change what happens. No, I want you to follow her. See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her. When they do, you call the cops. Then you get Mom the hell out. But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die. We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives. You ever talk to a victim's family? The one's left behind? They don't act like what you'd think. There's panic and fear. But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem. And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay. But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it. Just a glimmer. But somewhere they know. They know their world is never gonna be the same. I do know. I'm a cop. This is what I do. They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad. You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment. No. Nobody got... Wait a minute. I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be. I got the case file. We know what he's gonna do before he does it. That'll never work. They'll just think you're crazy. I don't know... What about the other women? Something we did changed the case...changed history. Mom wasn't dead. But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened. And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women. He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten. Dad, we did something. Something to make it worse. There was this case. A serial. He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69. The papers called them the Nightingale Murders. They never caught him. But the killings just stopped. October 22, 1969. No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me. She...she died. It's like it just happened. She's not here. It's Mom. Something happened, something... Dad...Dad... There's... I need to... What it was like when you died in the fire... Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know. Cause I still remember. It's hard to explain. Something happened today. It was like a dream. And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times. Times we never had before. We're doing all right, Dad. We're doing good. Dad, you there? You okay? Yeah, it's me. Dad...? Don't go. Don't go in that warehouse... Tomorrow. Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen. October 12, 1969. It did, Pop. It did. It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening. Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault. You went with the training, with your instincts. If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it. Fire. I never knew you, Dad. I lost you. But you're not...you're not still here. No wait, don't go! What's that? I'm trying to be, Dad. I'm tyrin'. It's good to hear your voice. I missed you...so much. Nah, I gave it up. No, not yet. Yeah...I think so. I'm not doing anything. Look, I don't know what's going on. But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998. 1998. I'm thirty-five years old. Wait a sec...there was something on the news. Something about this space anomaly. I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69. Sun spot? I don't know. Dad...? What if it's not... You just burned the desk. Oh my god. What's going on? I'm dreaming this. Shit, this is a dream. My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan. And every night when I went to bed he sang to me... Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd... 29-years ago. Now you listen to me. My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life. And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father... What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were? Gordo, if this is you, so help me... You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live? Is this some kind of joke? Gordo is that you? Are you fucking with me? What'd you say your name was? You call your son Little Chief? What'd you just say? This afternoon? Wasn't too tough, buddy. Game happened almost thirty years ago. Huh? Hello? Yeah. It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park. I got fed up with all the bullshit. I don't really follow baseball anymore. I can't believe people are still using these things. I thought these things were for talkin' around the world. Queens, New York. Pal, my whole life's an emergency. Look, I don't really remember how this thing works. Name's John. Uh, hello? Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live. Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy. Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it. Gordo? The Ham radio. That's how come he didn't die in the fire. Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes? My father didn't die in a fire? My father didn't die in a fire? Longbranch...? Better. The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It's tomorrow. No. I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in. I talked to him Gordo. I talked to my Dad. I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it. What the hell is that smell? I'm not your uncle, kid. Gordo, what are you doing here? Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile. Yeah. Sure. What? Not the first time that's been true. I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy. This is the guy, Satch. I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970. Eight days after the last Nightingale murder. Okay, lemme walk you through it. Which means he probably knew her. Our lucky break. Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968. That's what we need here, Satch. A lucky break. Ten? No. I remember this case. Three. He killed three women. I'm sorry. I just...you know...I... Yeah. That's it. Gordo, I wasn't dreaming. I talked to him, it was real. Whoa, I just...I just... She made up her mind. Nothin' I do is gonna change it. Yeah. I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her. I try to be. She's pretty special. Yeah...I remember. I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun. Yeah, that's right. Look who's talking. I know. I'm sorry. Work. So how'd you like LION KING? No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90! So how are things at the hospital? Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy. Sounds good. Hey, Ma, it's me. Checking in. Probably at work. Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night. Love you. It's a small world, Carl. And I'm gonna find you. Real soon. You have the right to speak to an att -- Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right... I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming. And I'm gonna steal your life away. You went down 30 years ago. You just don't know it yet. Talk about dumb luck. Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it. Bets part is she's the first victim. She knew the doer. I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking. No. Missing teenager. Disappeared thirty years ago. Found her bones last week. Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street. Mary Finelli. As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders. Nah, just working the job. The 2-3. Homicide. I look familiar? You used to be on the job? Oh. Sorry. How so? Wife around? Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Wait... Daddy, Daddy, I can't. I'm scared. Daddy, come up and sing the baseball. Daddy, I'm scared. Daddy put the wheels back on. I'm gonna fall. I know. Sorry, Dad.Get him home safe. You missed a hell of a game, Frank. Frank. We know. We know it's Shepard. Deleon. Go watch the game? Go watch the fucking game? Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer. It matches the Nightingale's profile. You understand what that means? Frank, this is insane... Frank, please... How's that? Are you listening to me? You're in a world of shit. An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment. We got your prints all over the place. Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank. You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe. Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl. Uh, huh. Uh, huh... Uh, huh. And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in? You can talk to Julia. Forget the radio. I wanna be wrong here. But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it. 415 Greenwich St. #302. Under the body of a murdered woman. Do you know where I found this? Let's go. Do us both a favor. Let's go outside and talk. We need to do that. I think you know, Frank. I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside. Frank, we need to talk... Hello, Frank. Lucky throw, fire boy. He ain't our guy, John. Got a minute? I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy. Uh, huh. So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself? Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better. This case just got hot. We pull on this string... April 16...? That means she was the first. That wasn't luck, Johnny boy. That was smarts and ten plus on the job. What're you talking'? You know better than anybody, John. You've read this file a thousand times. She makes ten. And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys. I don't need 'em. What I need is a partner I can count on. I care about you. Not cause of me and your old man. Not cause of your mom. But because of you. This is getting real old, John. And I'm tired up to here with it... Another rough night, huh? That it? Maybe you outta lay off a little... You're not looking too good. Nothing you're willing to do. Don't choke on your pride, Sull. You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.I'll go find Hayes. Where's the collar, in the cells? They around? I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North. You mind I take a shot at him? You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders? Fuck you, asshole. Sullivan? Who the fuck is this? Hell- Who are you? Huh. No kiddin'? I hear that. A hot shot, huh? No. What house you work? Yeah, long time ago. I know you? No. No. Well, sort of. In my heart. Been dead 29 years. Glad you did. Come on in. Buy you a cup of coffee?There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery. We tried. Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge. Wish I was. Oldest part of the system down there. We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile. Switches are shorted out.
