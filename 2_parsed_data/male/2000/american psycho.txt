Yes? Yes, Courtney? You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less. I never knew you smoked. You and...Luis? Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe. Maybe. See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch? Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate! Why? It's a plain end, see? So? Oh Jesus. I'm going home. It's a plain end. I think. What do you want, Courtney? I'm ignoring you. Is it a what? Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him. Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely. Yes, dear. Yes. J&B. Straight. You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump. Is that Donald Trump's car? Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember? Eight? The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight. Nice? I'm thinking Dorsia. Courtney? Dinner? Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed. Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. Pumpkin? Am I confused or were we talking about tonight? You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when? On a lot of lithium? Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight? Listen, what are you doing tonight? It's not that nice. Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here. Really? So, you're looking great, how have you been? Nothing like last time, promise. Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise. Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap. Do you take American Express? Do you want to come to my apartment or not? Would you like to see my apartment? I haven't seen you around here. I have to return some videotapes. I'm just leaving. I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going. If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now. I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes. I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. You're just not terribly important to me. We never really shared one. Yes, I am. I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them. I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore. It's over, Evelyn. It's all over We need to talk. My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs. I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch. It's not. No. I'm not. Why should I ? He has a great body He's good-looking. He's rich. Why don t you just go for Price? Hi. Pat Bateman. Because I...want...to...fit...in. I don't want to talk about it. No-I can't take the time off work. Is your Evian spiked? Evelyn? Do...what. Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?" No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy. Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality. How did you guess? I know her. I knew her. Nice. That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail. Picked them up from the printers yesterday You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . I won't...don't worry. But I think...I want to know what happened here. No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here? Are you sure? Doesn't he live here? I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place. No. No, you...didn't? Why not, you stupid bastard? It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible? Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer. Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true. What are you talking about? Bateman is what? Carnes? Wait. But wait, Harold, what do you mean? What exactly do you mean? Yes, naturally. Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously. What? CARRUTHERS I'll call you. I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes. What...is...it? Jesus lives, Luis. Commes des Garcon. No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken. Your compliment was sufficient Luis. Uh huh. Lucky, I guess. I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now? Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What? Don't tell me...merchant banking? Where to? Are you going to go get a gram? Don't, I'll drink it. Leaving what? Ask me a question. Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card. I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine. New card. What do you think? Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice. Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand. Calm down. Let's do it anyway It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay. What? Maybe it's just the light. I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus. That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there. Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out? See you then. Two at nine? Perfect. Oh really? That's great. Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock? Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight? Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps? Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus! Just...say...no! ...to the office this afternoon. I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean. What are I doing? Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch? Jean-I'm not- Hello? Jean, I need help! Jean? Hello? Jean? Thanks. It slipped my mind completely. If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you? Yes. I don t think I can...control myself. I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special. Jean? What? What...No! Put it in the carton. Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun. Forget it. Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this? Growing. I'm glad you said that. Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life? Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun. Interesting. Do you have a boyfriend? And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay? No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway. You can always he thinner. Look...better. I'm on a diet. But thank you. Jean? Sorbet? They know me. Yes? You're dressed...okay. Dorsia is...fine. Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go... Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere. No, come on. Anywhere you want. Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want. Well, isn't this a coincidence. That is...if you're not doing anything. Would you like to accompany me to dinner? Jean? Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence. Can you bring Mr... Tell him I'm at lunch. Who? Ye-es, Je-an? What is it? Come on, you're prettier than that. I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something. Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again. No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay? No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks. Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right? Just...say...no. Negative. Cancel it. When? I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else? Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages? No. I really don't. What? That's...that's too bad. Oh really? DAISY He said... He said you gave him bad vibes. Welt...it depends, why? I m into, well, murders and executions mostly. No. Flattering, but no. What do you think I do? Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin�e of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you. Next Saturday? Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time. Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria? Listen, if you could talk to them I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes. Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup? Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere. Well. Hello Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening. Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing. Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl? Come on. I think it would be a turn-on. Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive? Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free. No. Paul Owen. You're at Paul Owen s. Don't tell him you're here. Elizabeth, it's three in the morning. She's from...France. She's my...cousin. What do you mean, she was a hot number. Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night. So who was he with? Where was Marcus? Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? He does? You're sure? Well, does Marcus have an alibi? But Marcus denied it? Marcus? And? But how? Where do you place Paul that night? I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet? Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them. Not in the mood, I guess. I'll be there. No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me. Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers. Absolutely. I'm with you on that one. Great, yes, I'd like that. Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered. We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's. Well, I could he wrong. Well...I...Wait...What information have you received? What? I had a date with a girl named Veronica. God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes. Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a suspect? Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man. Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump. How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know. Don. Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball. Call me Don. Absolutely, I'm 100% with you. Uh, no. There's one...down here. You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes. The earth just opens up and swallows people. Nothing. That's so typical, isn't it? I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right? Had his apartment been burglarized? Have you consulted a psychic? Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and- What? Oh. Hmmm. But...has anyone seen him in London? Well, maybe he did, huh? Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints? We were both seven in 1969. Don't you know this? No, he just hung out there. Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places. Hang...out? No. Not really. I hope I'm not being cross-examined here. He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet. Yeah...Yale thing. I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know. Well... No problem. No, I guess it's okay. Bad habit. Who do you ask? Thanks. Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building. Harvard. The Harvard Business School. Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October. Shoot. You sure? I can always get you a lime. Understandable. Lime? Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything... Not on "Page Six" at least. Well, what's the topic of discussion? It's no problem Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle- Perrier? San Pellegrino? Coffee? Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes. You're not with the FBI or anything, are you? So, what's the topic of discussion? Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you. Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip. Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in... Just joking... No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it. Sorry about that. You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that? Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry. Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God. Shhhh...it's okay. Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you. Speak up. Come on. Listen, what's your name? Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work? I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you. You're not what? Qualified for anything else? Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job? Gee, uh, that's too bad. Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job? Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job? It's cold out, too, isn't it? Yes, it is. No, Owen. Yes, Owen? You like Huey Lewis and the News? Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us. Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap? Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check. Another Martini, Paul? Cecelia is, well...you know So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it? Nobody goes there anymore. Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello. Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here. Oh yes. I'm very lucky. Oh well, you know. It's...it's...all right. I've been great. And you?Now, if you'll excuse me. Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago. It's just not. But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore. Excuse me. I really must he going. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must... Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her? Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer. By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right? The message you left. It was a pretty long message, wasn't it? Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich... Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it? Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.Patrick? Where are you going? Call me please, Patrick. This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it. Where did you get your overnight bag? Patrick? Is that you? It looks so soft. That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture? Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?I can't...I can't find a shelter Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold. You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell. Al. Al. What am I gonna do? I'm hungry. I'm hungry I'm not... I'm so hungry. I lost my job... I'm so hungry. I'm so hungry.Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and � - you. He wasn't with Paul Owen. I checked it out. It's clean. Yes. Yes. Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure. I've questioned him. According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam. I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up. So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did? Suit yourself, I guess. But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before? No hash browns? Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations. Not a big music fan, eh? And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier. Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information? Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman. Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen? Let's see... That you were with- That's not the information I've received. Wait. That's not what I've got. Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance? Which was on the twentieth of December? Not really. I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence. I mean they want to get caught. Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think? 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli? So...you hang out here a lot? Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman. Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all... Oh really? I didn't know that. Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late? Eerie. Really eerie. People just...disappear. It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then... No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything. No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it. No. Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing. I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts- Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship? Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so... Actually, yes. His girlfriend doesn't think so. Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London. So was I. Anything else you can tell me about Owen? I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help. And where did he go to school? He had a yacht? Yeah. You know...hang out. Where did Paul hang out? Do you feel that way? What kind of man was he? Besides... the information you've just given. So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen? What do you mean...Yale thing? Yale thing? How well did you know him? What can you tell me about Paul Owen? You sure? Would you rather I not smoke? I know. I'm sorry. You seem...nervous. Pardon me, but are you okay? Nice. Very nice. Your address? Where did you go to school? How old are you? Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay? No, really. I'm okay. I think his family wants this kept quiet. The disappearance of Paul Owen. Oh no, I'm okay. KIMBALL. No, I'm okay. No. I'm okay. So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself- Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator. I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen. I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get. Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. Was that anything important?There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked. I said we are totally booked. We are totally booked. Dorsia, yes? Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam. Dorsia.Is that a raincoat? Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something? Hey, Halberstam? They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. No, man. I'm gonna bail. Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork. And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight? I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you. We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table. Yeah, well, you're late. And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl. Really? That's interesting. Not great? How's the Ransom account going, Marcus? Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about? No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing. I'm leaving! I...am...leaving! Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving. This. I'm leaving. I'm getting out. Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel. Raised lettering, pale nimbus white... But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. What's that, a gram? Like what? I guess you're right... THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY! SHUT UP! I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran. It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low! Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? Oh my God... Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it? Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it. There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy- That's Paul Owen. It looks that way, doesn't it? I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it? I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous. How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit? You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.Listen, what about dinner? Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar? Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman. Because he dated her. But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman? Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you think? Good coloring. What are the rules for a sweater vest? Some guys are just born cool, I guess. What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere. Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen. You think so?
