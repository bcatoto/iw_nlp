Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him. 'Good.' Yes. I told him. Nothing. What could I do? Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat. I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest. Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen. No choice. I had a visit from somebody. A couple of weeks back. I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret. Yes. I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird. I know. I know. I know. Hello, Jack, I don't know anything, Jack.He was drunk. Drunk as a lord. Fine. Nowt wrong with them. Well, he drove it into the river. Oh ay? What's it got to do with you? What do you want?I had to. It was the only way I could get at them. Jack... Jack, you're wrong. Christ, what... I don't know. That's all I was told. I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead. Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear. Kinnear did it. Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you. Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming, It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother? I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back, You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother, One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs. So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit, So I'm worried. I can't fight them ï¿½ I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead. A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant. Do you like it? Bloody well tell me who sent you. What about? What? Well? You know what the bloody time is! It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!You knew what I'd do. What did he say? Did Eric know that Frank was my brother? What did you do? Albert? Do you want to be dead, Albert? And you told Brumby? Who? How? When did you find out? How? Did Eric Pake pull her? You can't get away from me, Albert. Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you. Was he? How'd it happen, then? What about the brakes? Was the steering faulty? Yeah. This is my brother's car. What happened to this car? You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank. Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits. Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so? Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on. That's not good enough. Why? Why? What name? Yes. You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself. Never mind. I made a mistake. I made a mistake. I know. You must be joking, Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit. Address? Where's he living these days? Who sent you, Thorpey? Yes you can. Who paid you to see me off? Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey? That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank? What happens if I miss the train? You stay in the car. I'll come and listen. What you want to tell me, Thorpey? That's nice. Good evening. You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him? I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that. I'm the villain in the family, remember? What was bugging Frank? Once a week you like a gentleman? I call that regular. Why'd you see him so regular? Though nicer than most? But he was just another feller, wasn't he? Nothing more? Just another feller? How were things between you and Frank? Tomorrow morning, then? I want to talk to you later. Really. Hold it! Hold it! Who killed Frank, Margaret? What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone. Doreen. Fine... I want to talk to you. Well, it's Carter. That's my name, And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed. And you didn't know her last name? Now tell me the truth. Did my brother Frank find out? Then he must have pulled her. Who set it up? Eric? Is it one of Kinnear's films? Was it Albert? The young girl. Who pulled her? Tell me about the girl. I want to give you an Oscar. Sure I'm sure. Not entirely. No. Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap? What kind of entertaining? What does he want that bloody great country place for? Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out? Is he coming here? Who's setting you up in this place? And what was that? He must have been pretty sure I'd come. Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk! How'd you know where I'd be? Of course. Where else? So where are we going, Princess? No. I didn't know that. Yeah, I'll do you a favour. Was he? While he was here. You went about together? Really? No. Really? Go on. No, do you really? Oh, do you? Who? Yes, I do. I work for him. What? Thanks for coming. Look, look. Get your suit cleaned. Have another? Let her go. She'll be OK. Sorry about that. Yeah. A bloody funny thing! Nice of you to come. Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again. There. Go and get your hair done. Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that? Where's that? Where you going to live, then? You coming to South America? You all right now? That must be interesting. Oh, what you doing now? How's school? Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything? Sorry about your father. I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate. All right. All right. I want to square things with you first. No, I didn't, Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry? Did they give you a rough time? What happened to you, then? Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey? Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine? Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea? Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set. How many? Las Vegas. See you later. Good lad. That's nice. What'd you tell him? Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time. Large Scotch. Went to school with him. He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town. Where would I find him? I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall. Do you know a man called Albert Swift? Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right? You work here, Keith? Nobody seems to know. Since when did he drink whisky? Why would it? That's what I was wondering. Did you work with him, Keith? What? How could I stay away? I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'. I don't want to get rough, do I? They're friends of mine. No chance of that. Do us a favour? No. I'm not tired, Do you eat breakfast? Are you tired? Yes, thank you. You must be joking. I never eat breakfast, Did you sleep well? No. Think about it. 'Cos I know you wear purple underwear. You wouldn't. So shut up. What am I supposed to do? I don't know where they've taken him. Do you? Pension him off. What about Keith? That little shit! You're lucky. They kill as well. Don't ask me. They came back? Ta-ra. Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ... No, you won't. Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch. Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right. No. Really, I am. I'm sorry. Funny. Can I phone London? My brother, Frank. I'll bet this one's seen some action. You sure? Very nice. I'll pay you for tonight as well. Definitely. It's not like that, luv. I'm staying with a friend. I won't be using the room tonight. Eh? Have a drink. You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric. Not till I'm dead, Eric. Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it? You should have told me who you were working for. Yes, I retained that, Eric. Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric? They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow. Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension? Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like. So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good. And you should know, if I remember rightly. I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy. Yeah, Come off it, Eric. Who is it? What are you doing? Advertising Martini? Very... So, who you working for these days Eric? That's all right, Eric. A bereavement. A death in the family. It would be. If they were still living. No. I'm visiting relatives. Funny, that. Didn't you know this is my home town? Eric. Eric Paice. Is he? Yeah, I'll do that. Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I? I have to. Things to see to. Yes. Yeah. No? Funny that. Neither did I. Yep. Scotch, please. Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.Gerald wants to see him first. Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it. We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid. He said it'd be doing him a big favour. Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done. No. It's all right. No. I'll be off now. I should be at work. Don't worry. She's bound to be upset. It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus... ...then he goes and does a thing like that. It's a bloody funny thing. No. Frank was a good bloke. We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.Still got your sense of humour. Sod off. You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you. He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in. Cyril didn't like it, either. Jack! I didn't like that. Can't say I do. Still got a sense of humour? Making a living. That's not always a healthy way to be... What's it to you anyway? Oh, you've been watching television. Oh, I'm straight. Respectable. Well, well. Small world, isn't it? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Meaning what? Oh, that's nice. Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays? No, I didn't know that. What you doing around here then? Jack Carter.What? And get the clap? Not suede boots! Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground. What for? Protective purposes? Bollock naked with his socks still on?Shut up. I'll see you, then. You're not seeing me? Four hundred? What's that? All right. Two hundred. Three hundred altogether? What's that? Your hundred, and another hundred. What's that? A hundred? You're bluffing, you bastard! Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight. Nice surprise, isn't it? Oh yes? How? Get knotted. No. You bastard. You knew they'd come back. How'd you find me? Yeah. Who's Brumby? Four of them. Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park. Where you off to? Nowt. Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake. That's what he was saying about you. Heard of a man called Thorpe? What you having, Jack? How'd you know Albert? Today? At the races. He always goes. Yeah. He comes in here a bit. Right. Yes. Don't know. It just would. He was always the same. Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed. I mean, what for? At the Half Moon. I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work. He was always on time. I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.Shut up. The gun he means. But they have to be diplomatic. We've got to take you back to London.Knock it off, Gerald. Ask me? They do that up North.Can I go now? On the Durham Road. The Pantiles. He's got a new place at Burnham. Brumby! No, don't Jack, don't. I can't Jack. How can I? I've been asked to make sure you don't. Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time. Confidential, like. I'd like a word with you, Jack. Jack?
