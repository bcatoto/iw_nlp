What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind. Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head? That's pretty simplistic, don't you think? You're welcome. Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion. He's right, you look horrible. So I hear. Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference. He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast. I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in? We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on. He's fine. He's narrating. Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip. Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me. I peeked. Me? What can I do? That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher. Do you know he won't expel him? Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his? The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket. In a sense. Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this -- is for the best. Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories. You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage. Naturally you have copies. Christ, Tripp. How did you know? There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up. Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car... Such as. The hood jumper? So whose car is it? Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car. Want some help with that? It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas. Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that? So -- what do we do now? I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant. The Chancellor's here? Now? So what's the problem? I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid. Ye-es? The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out... Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack. So modest. Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed. Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his? Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth... So tell me about you and the Chancellor. Competence. Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile. I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones. You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade. Is it a little late to call the Chancellor? Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives. Good God. Let's go rescue him. Kidnapped? By who? James? My James? What's happened? Sometimes we have to improvise. Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you? What? Ohhhh. Is that... it? Tripp, where the hell... Tripp?! Where would we go? Back up. Go out the other way. Just go around him. Hit your brakes. Tripp. That was good. Because... because... And he had a younger brother who... was... a... He can't piss standing up anymore. Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled. Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple. No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor? On the contrary, it could be just the ticket. He is. Take my word for it. Well, I'm going to read it anyway. So. Is he any good? He finished it Winter Break. He has a book. Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog. Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way. Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do. I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp. But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here? Left you...? Who? Emily? Trip?? Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs. He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire. You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip?? Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But... ...I get pressure. Know what I mean? I thought you were tinkering. Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible? Mm. You're stoned. If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me. Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh. Perfect. Well then, shall we? Your wife. I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor... Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh... Tripp!I'll be... somewhere else. I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody. I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general. Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings. Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.You peeked, didn't you? Gee, I don't know, Crabs... Improvise. You're good at that. No. But I don't think that matters. Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that. Came to my senses. Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket... I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle. Kind of a sign, you're saying. He was never able to reproduce them. That was MacCaulay. I have an alternate version of the first chapter. Call it a hunch. No wonder he screwed us over. ...we find the jacket. 'That's my car, motherfucker.' He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his. My guess -- Vernon Hardapple. Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give. Don't touch it. First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car. Find the jacket. Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail. Evidently. Coming! Who do you think it is? There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem? Shut up, James. Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away. Is he awake? Crabtree. It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth. So sensitive. Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here. I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on. What's to tell? Which is? How bad is it for you? Only in your bones? Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines. Maybe... I don't know. It's a little late to call Admissions. Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live. His parents. Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped. Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me? Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room. You stay there. Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I -- Shit. Wait here. I'll be right back. Shit. What's this guy's problem? Yes. Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma. He heard everything we were saying. Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death. He lives with his mother. And now he's addicted to painkillers. Not Curtis. He's a boxer. A flyweight. Shut up and drink. I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now. Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's -- No. Not yet he isn't. I know. He started it Fall semester. I'm sure. Where is everyone? Is that just beer? Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today. This morning. I found a note in the kitchen. She left me. Crabs. He said something about being between things. It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money. I just mean... I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture. It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it. Isn't she? She's still a transvestite. She's a transvestite. Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities. Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown. Emily? I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling. How are you, Crabtree? Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall. It's cool, Jeff. Really. No... Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff. How are you -- is it Joe? You must be mistaken. It's mine. Excuse me? I have to see her. As soon as possible. So is my friend... is Sara still here? They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing. Actually, it was her husband's dog... She told you about... I know. Is that in my chart? I've been trying to finish a book... Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe. The last month maybe. Do you think that's why I've been having these... ...spells? I've been doing that a lot lately. I passed out. Sure. Right. Well, thanks. For the lift. Boy or girl? Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question? 'Fraid so. A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch. No, really... It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore. Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K. Relax, Vernon... Who's got a gun? Vernon. Yea? No. Sara, you don't understand... ...reconcile with Emily. What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just... Yes. But that's not why I called... I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about... Sara? Hi. It's Grady. Could you hold on a minute, honey? Hello? Yes, James. Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening. I'm a little worried, James. Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out. It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail. And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine. Ah, wear whatever you want. In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up. Get out of here. Near Carvel? I remember that. Five or six years ago. James, like it or not, they're your parents. James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand? Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat. You just worry about yourself, James. Okay? When nobody's looking. I eat. I don't know... 'Episodes.' Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells. No thanks. In a minute. Get us a table. Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore. And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years. Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack? Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay? I didn't mean it that way. I never said that. The hell I am. Not you. Your talent. Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you. That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop. James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat. I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does? Why do you wear that coat? Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever. Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's -- Who said anything about girlfriend? What? Jesus... Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least ...we abstain. I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy? I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning. Make yourself at home. I'll be right back. Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that. Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers. She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through. Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box. How can you tell? That's right. That one. Unless I miss my bet... my wife. Kinship. I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions. Amazing. Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school? James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper? What kind of dancer? Your father worked in a mannequin factory? I never heard of it. Carvel? Where's Carvel? Where's that? Jesus, James. Wow. Glaucoma? Maybe... Your aunt? Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on. Yeah, well, actually... Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you? Hm. I don't know... Me. Jesus, James, you should've told someone. But James. I mean... How long? So where have you been staying? I guess there's probably a story behind that. Well done, James. Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia. No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch. Hm. Ah. I don't believe in writer's block. Washed up? But... ? I think it's sort of writing itself at this point. Afraid so. Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right. What'd you tell him? What'd he say? Who? Sure. There is, but it's not that interesting. Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it. Oh. I'm okay. I just lost my balance. You're welcome. Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium. What's he saying? Is he all right? Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle. Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle. Have one. Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here? She is. Ah. Here we go... Miss Sloviak's. That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding... I've got tenure. Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman. I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog. Yea, James. He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one. Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me. Couldn't you've just pulled him off me? Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog. Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now. Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight. Right. Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too. I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things. Like the lady herself. Really. Go ahead. So I'm told. That's really it. This is worth it. James. Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see. Heaven? You're right. So what are you doing out here? You cold, James? Really? That's remarkable. Well... Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control. Sounds like a good one. She went crazy, Frances Farmer. You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw? Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way. Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room. Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James? ...You carry firearms. It's very convincing. Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.' That good, huh? Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission. He cribbed that from Borges. But where? I need the street. The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day? Crabtree? He doesn't even know James. Jesus. Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What? Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt. No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around? Hey. Oh. Well. I... I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point. All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa. Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was... That strikes me as odd. Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives? Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay? Do? I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get. I thank you. James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree. The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly? He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right? Me? Sure. Why? Thanks for that. He all right? Yes, Hannah? You don't deserve me, you know. In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers. Does he still love you? Did you tell Walter? I guess you have to go on faith. I went and looked at some babies just now. Ouch. How many? I know. I lost it all. I'm through improvising. I'm so glad to see you, Sara. And what did you say? He told you. I think I might've said I was in love with you. I think I might have. Would Walter really press charges? Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back. Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night. Someone stole my car. Over there. In the backseat of the... Inside. I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my -- Oh? Sara. I'm sort of helping him work through some issues. James Leer. About the baby. I know that. I know what's at stake here... Really, Sara, I... No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something. Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to... Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell... Really? That was fast. A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning. I heard. Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk? You got me. Caps. It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore. Well, no, I don't see any way. And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance. Not have it. I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me. No, really, Sara, I don't think you -- Well... Nothing. I think I twisted my -- Is the thing -- is it over? Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey. No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do. Yes. If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening. Hm. Simple. She's left the room before. She always came back. Emily left me this morning. Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...? All right. This morning -- New? I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is. I need to talk to you. Easy there. I got the message you called too. Chancellor. That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap. Jesus. Is that what he told you? He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit. Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one. He's writing his name in water. Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry. Listen, Antonia -- I'm not sure that's possible. James is... I don't know... I'm your man. He's still barking at me. He's blind. It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby. Lucky guess. That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it? The more the merrier. No. Sara. I'm in love with her. I'm in love with your wife. I... I... This is important. I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it? GRADY Tripp. English Department. It's Grady, Walter. Walter? As a heart attack. Do you get high, Sam? Yo, Traxler. Taking the long way home. Her husband. Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb. Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know? I don't know. It might be... Oh... yeah. I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye." Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that. Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and -- Neurologist? Why? What's wrong? I -- just want to say I'm sorry. I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand. Where's Emily, Hank? Maybe I should read it. And? What made you pull out that old thing? Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up. I might have his number on campus. Just kidding. The perpetrator. That's weird. I could be wrong. What happened anyway? Horses, right. Vernon something... Hardapple. Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.Give me a break, Grady. Why did you come here, Grady? Ah, right. The book. Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together. She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist. Where you stand? I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady. Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady. It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young. I was thinking of you. Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.Thank you. It's the Chancellor. No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy. You snore. Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams. Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something. You all right, Professor Tripp? The candelabras were my Gran's. Hey. What are you guys doing here? We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time. Actually... I just want to go home. That's just how my brain works, I guess. Even if I end up going to jail.... Professor Tripp...? Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled. I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp? Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog? I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle. Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp? That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement. I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak. She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me. Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton. Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead. I'm not going, with them. I'm not going with them. Where you going? Okay. When? It's because you don't eat. What would you call them then? That's why you're having them. Your spells. Want a bite? You coming? Arsonist's Daughter meant something. I'm sorry. But, last night... It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and -- Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself. Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself. You're lying. Jealous? Of me? Because of my coat? It's warm. So, why did you take me up there? Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act. You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog. You're mad at me, aren't you? Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night. I just wanted a little sip. It feels really... good... here. It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk. Maybe she didn't come here. Want one. They're incredible. Incredible. You can see the outline of a butt. Someone jumped on your car with their butt... The one that left you? Kinship. And what's here? This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again? Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself. When we fall, we fall hard. I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt. Whatever kind they wanted her to be. Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer. It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years. Outside Scranton. Carvel. It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town. Colon cancer. It's my father. He gets it from his doctor. Humboldt County? I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like. No. She seemed to take it pretty well. I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me. Isn't this...? Who? A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection. It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff. The bus station. There is, but it's not that interesting. I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave. How's that? And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad? How did I get here last night? Professor Tripp? Blocked. Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were... Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but -- That's a big book you're writing. I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced? Yes. He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior. The guy on the phone. He didn't give his name. Want me to get that? I guess there's probably a story behind that. I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something. I guess you really miss her, huh? I put you on the floor. Thank you. Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP! Mmhmmm... knap... sap... This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out. No thanks. I'm fine without them. Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay? Can I ask you something about her? Whose tuba is that anyway? That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly. Does she want to hear it was one of her professors? You? What are we going to do with... Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question? Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing. No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought -- I had to. Didn't I? You mean, with your wife leaving you and all? Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note. I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad. I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this. You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you? It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot. They're glass. The buttons. Really? The one she wore on her wedding day? Is that really it? I'll miss my bus. I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it... Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven... It's colder in there. A little. I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories. It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write. They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones. It's not bad. So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too. Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer. You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp. She likes old movies like I do, that's all. Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic. No! What gave you that idea? It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet... It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps. It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school. Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know... He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia? There's so many... Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room. George Sanders? No, I'm going ho --That's all right. We'll find him. One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you? No, the dog. We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over. Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing. Hardapple? A jockey? You mean, like --Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it? He was trying to steal my car! Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens. I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem. Stop calling me Vernon. No sweat. Only do me a favor? As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying? Shoot. And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you? Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy? Who the hell is that? Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun. Shut up. Cupcake. Please. Inside. You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it! Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.Bullshit. Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker. This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car? You driving this car?If he's happy... I'm happy. Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour... You'd recognize it if you tasted it. I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning. Excuse me? What is it, Grady? Oh? It's three-thirty, Grady. I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is? Grady? Who's this ? Yes?
