Stretch it out. That's a nice piece of heat right there. Yup. Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help. I don't know, I think I passed out or something. I don't remember. I don't know! Why you say that? That's okay, Unc. I can't swim, either. Y'all never use it? It's cool, but where's the water? You paid cash? Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car? Yeah. Thanks, Unc. Alright, I'll remember that. Naw, it ain't like that. Where you going? I don't know... I think he went out the back. Yes you did. I'm his cousin. Cheeco. Well get along with this one. Go ahead of us. Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight. It's about to work, just come on. It's something in that hydraulic pump. Black magic. Naw, I already ate. What's the green stuff poking out? Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend. Not me. I'm gone. What you mean talk to her? What happen? No I'm not. Shut up. I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.

Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous. make sure you get that car fixed. You're welcome, Unc. No, man, just wait. That pump was full of money. I saw where they put it. Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it. Wait. Me too. Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over. You go first. You go first. It is easy. You know why? 'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look. What's the B-G's? I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look. Naw. I bet'cha it's something better than air. You see that? Sorry about today, man. I don't know yet. Nothing. This vacuum don't work. Where's the restroom? Still gonna smell it. That ain't gonna work. You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out. I didn't think you smoked bud that much. I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters. You better stop running from that girl. I ain't trying to get in it. What's the matter? Okay, plan B. Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery? I don't know. Did ya'll forget to pay it or something? Yeah, that's why I walked down here. Yeah, ya'll got a notice today. It came certified mail. I walked. What you mean, so? Why? Yo know what? I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga. Who is that? You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D? Damn, you got a stalker. Restraining order? Where the hell you meet this girl? What? What's the matter with your girlfriend? Just a little. You straight? I know, be still. Lay down, Day-Day. Stop moving. Thanks for reminding me. Oh, yeah, where you work at? Man, this a cool house. This my baby. I feel like a new nigga in this car. I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus. Must be nice. I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll. This you? They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac? Who is that? I know, we had a good time. But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch. I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat. What's crackin'? Yeah, I'm cool. See you later. Okay. I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me. Make sure. I did. Is that door locked? I'm sorry to hear that. Why didn't she put'em out? Most of it. I just hate to see you in this situation. Yes I did. Excuse me. I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life. Huh? Most definitely. It's cool. You ain't got to apologize for your brothers. They're big boys. Hell yeah, I remember you. What you mean, you don't know? Just wait here. You want us to give you a ride? Oh yeah, why you walking? Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together. Where you going? What is it? Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers. You want tickets? I don't play for no team. Can I help you? I said hold on! Hold on. Nothing. You too. Yeah, pops! Come on. You see that? Have you seen Day-Day? I'll remember. Hey, Pops, I'm grown. Can't nobody get me in trouble no more. You coming in? Why they got to have the loudest house on the block! It's alright. All damn. Smells like you didn't fall in no mud. I do. Ya'll making me look like a punk. What's the matter? Here I come! I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes! It's a long story. Right now we gotta do somethin'. Nice to meet you? What kind of activity? Yeah, I'm 'bout it. Excuse me?Bullshit! I'll go postal in this mothafucka! I don't have no damn cover. No, give me my damn money back. Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither. I can't get jiggy with this shit. Where is the damn manager?And I can go free? That's it? Anything you need. I will. When can I come visit? You sure you don't wanna stay? What about me? Wait here? So Cheeco can bite my ass off? Tell me where it is I'll do it. What you see? Wait for what? I hope to God that dog is happy. I ain't scared of you. We ain't little no more. No. Naw, you go first. You make it sound so easy. The bubble guts. I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself. Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's. How you know? It could be anything. Yeah, air. I didn't see nothing. Alright, Roach, see you around. What we gonna do? Craig, what the hell are you doing? Out the door and to the left. It works. Blow. Ain't no windows in here. I don't. Big bitches need love, too, Craig. Thanks a lot, Craig. Fuuuuuuck -- U! You already in. D'Wana brought Baby'D up here. $247. It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow. How can they do this? You know what this is? You walked? If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home. I gotta live here. Just remember that. So. Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy. And I'm just trying to keep the peace. We moved out here to get away from that shit. I know what 'cha thinking. I thought the same thing. But it can't happen. That's the sister. You don't know Baby D. That ain't the worst part. Her little sister, Baby D. She's the one that gets real physical. But I got a restraining order on her, too. I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way. Worst day of my life. Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing. Man, it's a long story. I met D'Wana three months ago. She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention. Come to find out, she six months pregnant. Saying I'm the daddy! I can't taste nothing. Yeah, I'm alright. Is my face still orange to you? She pepper-sprayed me, man! She pepper- sprayed me! I can't see! I can't see! Daddy! Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center. I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you. 'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig. Go on and make yourself at home. I'mma go get dressed for work. Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it. Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million. We bought this house and I spent the rest on this. It's the bomb, huh? Yeah, that's me. Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up. Naw, them dudes is assholes. Especially that dog - Cheeco. Watch this little ass, he's sneaky. Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac. Joker, he just got out of the pen. Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority. And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall. I know; this a long way from Watts. But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing. Just peace and quiet. Listen. Yep. I forgot about him cussin' out everybody. Damn that was fun. You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last? Up at the family reunion. You. Hi, Uncle Willie. Well, you gonna have to go postal then. I can't give you your damn money back on this. Okay, sir...but where's the cover? Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment. I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD? Call me. Thanks for the help. Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach? Get 'em, Craig! Money? Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers. We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid. That's all. What?! What that mean? Ya'll live around here? ...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing. How y'all doing? Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding. All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar. 'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock. You wanna knock? Don't worry about it. We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now. He's inside the house? Roach...Roach, come on. Butterflies, my ass. I'm about to go home. Are you out your mind? I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy. You must be crazy. Let it go! Let it go, Roach, trust me. Yoooo, that's it. You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach. I don't know. I hope Craig got a good idea. We gotta ask him when he comes out. Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here. I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow. Roach, what are you doing? Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint. I didn't even pass it. Today ain't my day. Are they still out there? What was that? You damn right that's the big one. Don't worry about it, man. Get the phone. Ever since my momma died the bills are always late. Craig, this Roach. Roach, this is my cousin, Craig. Yeah, it was. How you get up here? Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited. But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired. You feel me? Where's Craig? I know. I'm sorry. I got fired too. 20 minutes? Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community. By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations. Why would he take it? He don't even know you. Shhhh! Roach, shut the fuck up. Alright, no problem. We gone. Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar? Nothing.Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go. Wife stays here, of course. Okay, buddy. Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me. It's just a certified mail delivery. Come on, jerky, you can tell me. Got a white wife, huh? Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for? You're not related to the Jacksons, are you? Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for? Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here. Delivery! Delivery!I don't know. Good, let's get out. Huh? I don't know. I can't feel my legs no more. Debo! Debo! You too big. Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones. Drop everything, Craig is in trouble. Come quick. Don't try to call. I don't know the number. That ain't gonna work. What urgent message? Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that. Yeah. He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day. I don't know, Debo.Tape his mouth shut. Shut up! Where's that other miyatea? I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right. Shut up! Both of you right now! What?! This look like a 7-11 or something? Get the fuck outta here! What the fuck you looking at? Yeah, and hurry up. Take your car. Nothing. What you want? Hey! I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later. Now get out of here. You're scaring our company. I'll take you later.Smokin' what? Nigga, you got knock the fuck out. Two bullets? Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick. I saw it. Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy. Craig, what the hell wrong with you? Where you been? Craig, remember what I told you. No, I'mma go on to work. I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth. Now listen to me, Craig. It's gonna be different living over here. Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit. Understand? 18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing. I still can't figure that one out. Nice neighborhood, huh? Just hold your breath. I gotta get'em fixed. They don't roll down. What it smell like? Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing. It ain't about being a punk, son. It's about this... That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something! That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now. I fell in some mud. Now hurry up! Well bring yo' ass on... Hurry up; today is Fri-day! And we gotta hit the high-way! Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff. What's the matter? The skills are still intact. Now tie his ass up, Elroy. Need to lose some weight. I got my mase. Don't get it twisted, Elroy. I ain't lost none of my street skills. You come way out here to get into more trouble. You could've stayed at home. Somebody left me a message. Well where's Craig and Day-Day? You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message? I got your message. Where's Craig? Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.Fuck, what's his name? Dude, dogs hate me. I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along. What about the dog? Me neither. Sorry, bro, reflexes. How did you do that? Come on, Day, try it. For moms. That's cron-don, sir. My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite? That's fuckin' poetic, Craig. For sure. That's how I like 'em. You know what he mean, dude. Great moves, Day-Day. I'll do it. Okay, later, bro. Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha. Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money. Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight. Hey, guys, I'm outta here. He's a boy, dude. Bite his ear! Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday. I don't know. Hey. And some rolling papers. This is a knock. Go for it. Why did he go in the house? Where's Craig? Try an' hold it, man. Squeeze your ass cheeks together. I say we go over there and kick their asses. I can take the little one. I'm not letting nothing go. They killed my board. Who the fuck is that, Day-Day? I know. Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money. You could sell your Beamer. R-U-S-H Intensely. Sorry, dude. I do. Bummer, huh? And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day. Negative...they vamped. You don't wanna know. That the big one, huh? What is it? What it say? What up, bro? Did you see that? That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day? I feel you. I've just been practicing that one move all week. I thought that was it.Don't move me. Thank you. I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing. Me, too. You think they're in there? No. Thought he was with you. Passed out? Can't hang, huh? Boy, I knew you was a lightweight. Passed out on one funky ass blunt. They don't make 'em like they used to, baby. Suga! Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman? 'Cause your lips is getting black. I know you smoke weed, right? Good. Never... But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though. Don't need water. We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim. Cash money. They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan. That's for suckas. They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago. I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here. Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig. I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs. But as soon as I got my check, I was gone. Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house. Well, let me in. Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working. My back keep going out... she don't never get enough. But check this out. I got to lay some ground rules. Your my family and I love you. You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking? Send Betty my love. Boy you looking good. I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside. I got something to show you. You know me? I would've shot his big ass. Hey, Willie, how's it going? Still steppin' in dog shit every day? If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson. Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'? I don't know. Sorry, my ass. When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day. What?! Ah damn. Damn. Yeah, 20 minutes. Trust me. I've been pepper sprayed nine times. 20 minutes. Wet your eyes, boy. Stay in there for about 20 minutes. Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime. I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn. My back. Damn, big bro. You swung that like Sammy Sosa. Shut yo' ass up. What about that ugly dog? Willie, shut up. Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes. I don't know. Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them. Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain! I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message! Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro. He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby! This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent. Ain't that right, nephew? For what? We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow! Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight. I threw my back, again. Mr. Nasty time. But take it easy on me, girl. What you doing to my nephew? Suga. Go ahead and get us something to smoke on. Okay, okay, that's enough. Go put on some damn clothes. Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga. Suga, this is Craig.
