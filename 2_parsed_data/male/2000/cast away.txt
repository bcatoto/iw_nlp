Nobody remembers that. It's bad. Six kilometers. Four miles.You can't make it. Then we've just got shit. What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day? The next day we just start over again. Nothing out there but ocean. Look again, asshole. It's a mirage. You are. It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot. I float. You sink. End of story. They're always on autopilot. Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave. They'll never see you. They're never going to see you. You're just another piece of trash in the ocean. What are you smiling about? They'll be back. Thank you for fucking up my life. Yeah, sure, what? That's death knocking, knocking on your door. Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door... Die tomorrow or die today. Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move. The sea is lovely, dark and deep. Look, just slip off the raft. The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm. Take a little swim. Sleep. I'm lost. Goodbye. They'd eat you if they could. They're laughing at you. Listen. You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die. What are you doing? You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft. Water water water -- Get water! You're putting off the inevitable. You don't know where you are. You missed the shipping lanes. If they can't see you, what's the point? No. No. No more water, you said. Going to die anyway. Do too much, I'll die. No water, no work. Thirsty. Can't. Need water. Feels so good to lie here. With what? There's nothing to fix it with. This rope comes undone, you're going to drown. Shit! Shit! Shit! Catch another fish tomorrow.The failures they remember. It's the successes they forget. Worse than Warsaw. So how are we going to get this place shaped up? It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles. And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what -- Sure. No. that was the last one. To tell you the truth -- you did. Well, not really, I -- Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient. Well, I do a little drawing -- They're harder to do than they look. Possible. So you did those wings? Okay. Sure. As much as anybody. No. There was an unavoidable delay. So do I. Yeah, a long one. I had it on the island with me. Had a package to deliver. I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled. You too. It means a lot...that you came. I don't know. I really don't know. Great. Really. That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway. I didn't know what really being alone was. No one back here does. Not when you have no choice. Cliches, mainly. Don't take anyone for granted. Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last. The tide came in, the tide went out. I survived. That's the headline. I survived. The plane went down. My friends died. I washed up on an island. Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am. That about sums it up. What was inside? There was a coffin? My epitaph. Yeah, well...couldn't be helped. That's my sea anchor. My second one. Made it out of part of the sail. It keeps you from capsizing in a storm. In theory. And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day. Is that Jango? You have any children? I would have done the same thing. I know. I thought you might have. A few things came up. Or went down. Hey...hey...it's okay! A week, max. Okay? Okay? Malaysia. They're holding the sweep. Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back. I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt. No, it was great. Maybe a little overkill -- Yes there is. It's our dog. It belongs to us. I can't take him to work. Could you watch Jango? We're a little emotional here. It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting. I have to. Look, I love the puppy. I love you. But I have to go. You did? I have to go. I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub. You know, for when you travel. And for you -- I can't even keep fish alive. He is a cute thing. Hey, look at you. Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better. Four four. A record. Not if you work for FedEx. What do you want me to say? That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit? That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did? Got to follow the paper path here. I thought I did. Cold. Let's take a look. You smell like formaldehyde. Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you. Anything else? When's the next Jumbo? Terrific. Yours? I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg. Doc, I'm not on the island. I'm not on the raft. I'm alive. I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you. I just want out of here. Not to mention on me. Yes, yes he did. I most definitely say I am. But all that's behind me. I'm fine now. I am one lucky guy. Which I didn't have. All I ate was fish. That's solid protein. Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache? My favorite doctor. What's the verdict? Yeah. Sure. I used to drive one of those. A long time ago. No. Need some help? Just don't count 'em before they hatch. Really? True enough. No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know. But chickens? So did I. Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord. Amen. The tide saved me, Mom. I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next. I've got all this back pay coming. Why don't you let me get you a place in town? I wanted to come here. When'd you start working here? Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me. The place is falling apart. Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here... Mom, this is a farm. We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream. Look, I help take care of the place. You got my check, didn't you Mom? It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me. Mom, meet Jango. Can you find her? What about the sender? Kamal, you're breaking up. Can you hear us? Who's in charge then, where is Chinn? What's going on down there? Who is this? Where is Kamal? Thanks. For everything. I need to do it. Deliver this package. Then, I dunno. Not just that. Take your time. Use it. Live it. That's what it's about. Take your time. Digital laser readers. Wow. Terrific. Believe me I know. To life. What's it all about? It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about. Hallelujah. To Wilson. I never thought it would end. Then it did. It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing. Forty-three days. Time I had lots of. I braided them. You should have smelled me. Want to see my raft? This is Amber. Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack. I beat the odds! I'm most definitely not dead. And as I recall, you're the sick fucker. It's me. Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland... Right. Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia. Talk is cheap. Are we on or not? A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month. This was nothing like Warsaw. I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal. You are one sick fucker. For the third time. That's why you're a gambling man. I'm from Arkansas. Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention. Forget it. And never take. It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered. Baloney. I do see the damn "big picture." Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point. I was making a point. You fucked us over. Jesus. I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team... I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up. You what? Great. Terrific. The good guys won one for a change. Borrowed. I borrowed it. No please, join me. Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on. As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself. May I ask, where are you bound? Permission to come aboard, sir.Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us. Just the dentist tomorrow. You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life? Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you. If you say you are. Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach. It's almost like schizophrenia. Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out. And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient. So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat. Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy. Protein digestion is very costly in water usage. Dehydration. Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency. Any or all of the above. Under the circumstances your overall health is good. Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.You're Chuck Noland. Hey, once a driver, always a driver. You want a lift? I've just got one more pickup. You're not out of Pascagoula, are you? You bet I do. High tide comes right up to this road.Shut up. I don't feel like dying today. It matters. We do the best we can, that's all we have. Let's get a second opinion. Wilson? What do you see? It's real. Jesus. What's so damn funny? Shut up. I'm serious. I'm always going on about me, me, me. Enough about me. Your turn. Damn it! Don't be so negative! They're on autopilot. I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel. With Kelly. You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you. Thank you God. Grow up, stop being such a baby. Other people get through a lot worse. If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize. But I have promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep. Got to fix the sea anchor. Use the sail. You quitter you quitter you quitter. No! Why do they have to die for me? Can't kill another one. Can't. Can't kill my friends anymore. You're beautiful. Marry me. Fix raft first. I'm putting it off. Moon's too bright. Polaris, where are you? Maybe I'm too far south. Survive today, that's the point. Wilson, do you believe this? Take the damn water. Take it, damn it. Take it. Do too little you'll die. Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more. Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it. You've had today's water. Get up, damn you. Get up. Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying. Solution, fix rope. Save some for tomorrow.Come on down to the plant. It's state of the art. We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business. Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960. Going to pass beef. Chicken's global. No religious taboos. You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry. Thought you were going to bring her. Let's eat.No sweat. Finish what you started. You haven't changed, Chuck. It's still you. You want that delivered, we'll deliver it. That's what we do. What, then? Deep, real deep. Being patient. Don't rush things. I get it. What? Digital laser readers. That's all there is. To life. Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke. I'm serious. The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon... You've been over the line and you came back. You've been saved, hallelujah! To Wilson. When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles. You were how long on this? Must have taken a hell of a long time. Cool ropes. This stinks really bad. How about we go somewhere else? Hello. You beat 'em to shit, pal! Jesus! You're fucking dead! God damn! God damn! Chuck, it's you! Hello? Malaysia's tanking. We're meeting in ten in operations. We're on. Ninety five percent? Just give me the money now. I'm trying to help you here. There's Warsaw, there's this -- Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow. That's FedEx, that's women, that's life. That's why I'm running foreign and you're not. That's why you're not married and I am. We're warriors, not desk jockeys. We've got to be bold. You always want all your ducks lined up. But nothing's 100 percent. It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60. Then roll the dice. You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right. Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while? So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go. Look, I'm sorry about your plane. But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis. For all those vacation days you got coming. I didn't know we had sailboats. You know what your problem is? You just see the packages in front of you. You don't see the big picture. What? Let Paris hold its plane? Let Memphis take care of it? Let somebody down the line clean up your mess? The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection. I'm touched. But I might not have. It was fifteen minutes late. How'd it go? What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization. I don't have it. Hmmm. Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account. Sure. Bettina Peterson. Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check. Okay. After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC. Here it is. Ten packages from the same sender. Baku. Delhi. St. Petersburg. The guy was a real road warrior. This package was Kuala Lampur. No activity in his account after this package. No forwarding addresses after K.L. Trying.Kamal is not here. We are very defused. It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter. Kamal is not here.
