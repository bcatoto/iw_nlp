That woulda been cool. What? Did you catch that thunder? Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today. C'mon with us. Work! Don't say that word, man. Gabe! Hey, man! Gabe! It's Gabe!Cursin'. That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct, mate. Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left! Who's shooting? Ready to die quiet-like, asshole. More bang for the buck. Answer the man.Exactly, cheesehead, exactly. Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out. I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos. "It's a perfect day for a monster jump." Hey man, can you like do me a favor? No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder. C'mon let's rock an' roll. C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush! Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it! How yo doin', Gabe!Jessie, Hal, come in...please report. Over. Rooster! Forget the hen stuff. Be safe, honey. Over. Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight. Jessie, Jessie, copy? I admit, I can be bought. Hal will have my head for this. I don't know. They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe. So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse. What usually eats a banana? So, what do you see?WHEN SHE'S SAFE! You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash! You're getting warmer! Copy. Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder. Jessie! Are you alright? Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you. I need my bolt gun and an ice axe. Looks like the Tower. It's a bad climb. Bags? It can't fly in this weather. You keep it. Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him. Not on that leg. Give him the money. Near Freedom Falls. She went for help. How's your leg? I'll live. Where'd you leave Jessie? My pleasure. Would you? If you want, do it. I don't care. And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell. Now drop it! Look, it was a bad time for everybody. There wasn't time for anything else. I did what I thought was right. Look, I know-- I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it. When we get this group down, I'm gone. I was with Jessie, she filled me in. She's losing it! The clip's not gonna hold! I'm coming out! Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times-- Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare idiot line for transport, over. Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub. Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee? You're not gonna die. Grab me with your other hand! Use your other hand! Grab it! I'm here! Sarah, I'm here! I'm here--I've got you! Nice and easy... That's it, you look like a professional. There you go. Sure you can. Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance across . Count it as you go: One, two...by eight you'll be there. Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner? She's tough. Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind... How're ya feeling? Room service...Hi, Sarah. And miss all of this peace and quiet? Never, right Hal? The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine. RUN, DAMMIT!! Can't do it. Now go back and get help! Just kidding. Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience. An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall. Wrap it around that rock twice. Take the rope. Take the rope. We don't have time to argue about it! But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds. What do you think? Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it. That's exactly what I want you to do. "Time is money" -- please. There's no "we". There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face. Crockett River is where the last of the money fell. I don't know. I don't know. We were going together before I ever let go of you. Do it, goddammit! Reach up! Do it! Hold on! Hold on! Reach up! Jess, c'mon... Helluva time for vanity! Never, what?! These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300. I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold. Start pulling it apart! We're climbing down on it. Pull it apart! Forget it. If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us. This way. We gotta get out and fire a flare. It's the only chance! She's a lyin' bitch!! Next time, date only basketball players. For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright. When I secure the line, come on up. Up ahead. No, not really. Throw down a rope. What was God thinking when he built this place? Nice view, huh? Cute. A simple yes or no would have done. We have to get through to the other side. You up for it? Sure, just give it back when you're done. Yeah? I don't know. Here, lay down and get some rest. We're going to need it. Only kidding... actually I attacked you. You attacked me. Of course I do. Call me sentimental. Making things real rough for Hal. I can't believe you just said that. Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place. Don't worry about me, just go. Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave. They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we. How are you holding up? Let's be creative. Yeah, let's go. That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too. Why'd you have to come up here?! Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead. So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here! Do it Jessie. You got to go back now! How'd you get up here? What are you doing here!? I only came back for you. Can't do it. I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel. He can handle it. He doesn't want my help. Hal knows what he's doing. Jess--you look good. If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear. Like I said, I can't turn it off. It doesn't matter, anywhere but here. I can't. Not here. If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else. No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience. From one professional to another, of course. Flare up of old emotions... Maybe lead to a flare up... --mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe... Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation-- Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting-- Why are you yelling? Why are you yelling? You couldn't. I don't expect you to understand. I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me. I play it back in my mind everyday. Did I? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line. Maybe I panicked. I don't think you do. A lot of things fell apart up there. After the funeral I just had to leave. Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start. When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble. On my way. Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park? And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever. Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber... We spent a night there one night... The ledge, I know it well, or should I say we know it well. Don't say that. You'll embarrass Frank. Just hangin' out. That's a virtue isn't it? Do you see them yet? Never could save a thing. I burned it. Good memory. You must be great with numbers.Fuck you. Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright. C-4? Nothing, just tourist souvenirs. Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not, are you Frank? A monkey? Surprise me. Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece. Take the gun. I'm going with you. What are we going to do? Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah. I know you did what you could-- Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to. Forget me. If you can, get away. No, buddy, it was you who dropped it! What the hell do you know about bad time. You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family. We'll never know, will we? Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it-- You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died. Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you. You're gone now! I don't climb with people I can't trust. Why'd you come up, to prove something? Now let me fill you in. You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in-- What the hell are you doing here?! Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second. Jesus Christ, grab her! No, stay off the line! You'll break her loose! Hey, fuck you. Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait. I love you, too. I think it's out. No big deal. It's that old football injury. Glad you could drop in. What are you talking about? Qualen, go fuck yourself. The game's over--you lost. When he finds the money, you're as dead as me. He never hurt anybody. There is. Murdering, motherfucker... You son of a bitch! You said you wouldn't kill him! For Christ's sake, they're kids. It's up there, on the Tower. No, he's gone. The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass. Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm. Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower. So far, no sign of anyone. Looks like a phoney call. Over. The best he can since you gave him nothing. He'll freeze. Right, all the bullets we can eat. What the hell's going on? There. You blind? Half a day. On top of the peak. The down drafts would wipe her out. It's the only chopper. If it goes, you got no ride out. Tucker and Walker. Yeah... Right. Climb, Gabe, climb! Negative . The winds are too high. I'm going to ride out the storm here. I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out. Bob and Rick are in Denver. I gotta get up there as fast as possible. Frank, get me a load of flares. You're looking at him. You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together. Acknowledge. Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over. Hold on, baby, he'll get you. Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit! Don't you see what he's doing! He's hijacking the shipment! Now I have jurisdiction! I said get your weapons. Do you always transport through the air? I don't know about totally.The money! Throw it up or I'll kill her. Where are you, Walker? Love's a killer, isn't it? I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy? Tucker? Go on, fetch. A bad climb, no, just another challenge. What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers. Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device. Step into my office. You know how the airlines are. This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers. That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper? No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?! Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it. Travers, you're not running things. I'm touched. Kristel, check the chopper, let's go. You said there was a way across. Kill a few people, they call you a murderer. When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror. Go figure. Move on Tucker, time is short. Sue me. We're not animals, but don't force us to be. Walk over. How far? No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market. Except you, the loyal one. Didn't I tell you to warm the place up? Souvenirs? No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible? Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct. Talk. No tricks, no codes, no messages. You haven't found us. It was a fake call. What's he doing? Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too. The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be. Where's the helicopter? Get off the radio! No names, this is an open line! You got what we need? Give me the fucking code! What's the code, Travers? Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us. Primed to go off right over his head, officer. Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move. Good, Travers. It might catch on, like shooting skeet. Jessie? Looks like your friend found company. He can't be far away. Find him. Go! Then go fetch. Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die. How's your health? Man against nature, right Travers. Bring down the money or your friend's dead! Kill him when he gets down. We agree on something. And for insurance, take his coat. I haven't even got on it yet. Let's go, time to fetch. Where's the third one, Travers? Ask the questions. The monitor! I never ask twice. Were. Give me the tracking monitor! What's the delay? Why didn't you send the money over? Travers! Hurry it up.Then where the fuck is! He asked you, how far?! I think you've been taking the scenic route. How far from here? It looks like a winding route. Have her come up. Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags. What's your names? Anyone else following? Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son. These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause. What the hell are you doing-- Who the hell ever is. This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even in circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange. I don't give a shit, Qualen! I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you. They beat us. A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could. No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive. I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals. Why the hell are we wasting time here?! Is it set? This is insane. The hell with the money. You radio in for that chopper, understand! You dumb bastard, you waited too long. If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours. The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway. We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here. Where's the next one? He's alive! This way. What about it? We can't and he knows it. I don't trust him. Don't give him anything. Get off my back, Qualen! There, what's that place? You're both with the mountain rescue team? Don't use my name! Why? What are you going to do?! Kill me? Christ we're partners in this! Let's move your ass in there!! Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first. On my way. The cases are hooked up and ready. We should be. Everybody wants what we have. I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt. You're the boss. Let's head out to the tarmac. Matheson, have you been totally briefed? We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right. Richard Travers. Good morning, Walt.I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government. Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But nobody can get to us in flight. Appreciate it. Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride. I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI. Rich...
