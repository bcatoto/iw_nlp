Nothing yet. Wait a minute -- there's Hal. And his date. He's signalling "okay." Right where he's supposed to be. Excuse me -- I know you're my salvation, and all -- do you think you could rescue us before your smoke break? Maybe you could tell me why I am rescuing you. Basically -- I've fallen down, and I can't get up... Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare idiot line for transport, over -- Rescue One -- please remind me to tell you about the time I hauled your hero here down Mt. Huntington on my back, over -- This guy showing you a good time? Now, remember -- keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times -- Fuck you -- Ready? Did he tell you about the time he almost made it up Everest? Well, if he's bored you with that bullshit, then this has to be the best part of a bad date. Right? Ready? Yes you can. You can do it. Don't look down.  The whole way across, don't look down. Look at me. Just keep looking at me -- and you'll be okay. Sure? Hold on. I'm coming out to get you. Keep looking at me. Hold on -- Falling. Midsize? Any size, any color, any model. How long will you be needing it? Just under six hours. This is new... Still find the dead ones the old fashioned way, I guess. If I did, I'd have to listen to you tell me one more time that it wasn't my fault. -- If I did everything right, Susan Collins would still be alive. Do you really believe all that?  That it wasn't our fault? I'm not sure what I wish more, Maggie. That you meant what you said, just now -- or that it were really true then. Maggie, where the hell have you been? I've got two climbers out -- Brett and Evan are up there again to jump off the spur. Their wives called twice. I want you in the air and I want them found before the storm system moves in. Now. Christ. You're in charge of Rescue now? There was a vacancy. Maybe you heard about it. The last guy lost his nerve and lit out of town. Well, you're a better man than I am, Hal. Nothing rattles you. Gabe! Long time, son -- why don't you come meet some of the new guys -- Good idea. Say, Hal? Why don't you come with me so we can show these rookies how to death-rig a woman properly? Take the Bronco to where you're going. I've already been. Then go back to wherever it is you like to hide. And stay there. Tell Wright the San Francisco shipment is ready. Right away, Mr. Travers. Good -- good. I'll be right down. Watch me. Walter Wright? Matheson. FBI. We need to talk. We'll be fueled and ready in ten minutes, Mr. Travers. Be ready in five. Go ahead and take ten. We'll need the time. Matheson. FBI. Your parents must be proud. What the fuck is this about? Small problem with the shipment, Travers. Tell him what you just told me. We got word that somebody's been observing your currency shipments -- this load, the $5,000s -- over the last three deliveries. There isn't a hell of a lot anyone can do but observe. This is the most protected shipment we've got -- and the most useless for a thief. Those bills aren't in circulation. You think five thousand dollar bills are easy to pass? Who the fuck would try? This guy might. Who is he? His name's Eric Qualen. One of the East German spies who got shut out by the reunification. The CIA issued an inter-agency warning about him right after the wall came down. He's got nowhere to go and nothing to lose. He's also got the international connections to get rid of bills like these -- and he's probably desperate enough to try for them. Fifty million bucks buys a lot of sanctuary. Could you get to the part where I'm supposed to care? We had two agents monitoring him. These two -- Gleason and Quinones. Their last report said he was going to try to take this shipment. Thanks for the tip. But I've got work to do. Did I say "last" report? I think I did. I mean last fucking report. These guys have vanished. You have my sympathy, but -- There's a reason we do things this way, all right? Armored cars can be hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But nobody can get to us in flight. The only time this is on the ground is at the mint, or on the Presidio runway in San Francisco. Either way, someone would have to shoot his way past a couple of thousand guards. If you're worried about an inside job, forget it. I checked the plane from top to bottom an hour ago. And these three are my best against. Even if one of them did go skydiving, they wouldn't get far. Each case has an electronic tracer with a range of one hundred miles. I haven't lost a bill in eight years. And I'm not scrubbing this shipment because you scare easily. Who said anything about stopping the shipment? I've been tracking Qualen for almost a year. If he pulls something, I want to be in on the party. This is cleared from the top, Travers. Matheson will accompany you on the flight to San Francisco. Show him every professional courtesy. Rescue One -- have you sighted them? Over -- Rescue One -- abort. They'll be all right. Brett and Evan are dumb enough not to log in, but they're smart enough to have storm gear. Head back to base. Maybe you can catch Gabe before he leaves. Over. Way to check the weather, Brett. Hey. If it were easy, it wouldn't be worth d-doing. Just enjoy the view, huh? Relax. I mean, what could happen in the air? Stay put! Don't panic, goddammit! He's coming in too slow. No -- we're going too fast, and we're too high up. Push flaps forward twenty degrees and drop to five thousand feet. You got any rifles? Forward compartment -- left side -- What the hell are you doing -- Checked the plane from top to bottom, huh? You fucker -- Put your hands behind your head! It's over! Calm down -- give the gun to me -- There's a couple of dead bodies in the front compartment -- they're FBI agents -- He's losing it -- Goddamn it! Don't you see what he's doing! He's hijacking the fucking shipment! Don't make me shoot you! Don't make me laugh. Move into position. More -- more -- keep it coming -- Locked on. Move into lateral position. We're right on the edge of the storm -- let's move it. This isn't going to work -- Wright will suspect something. So what. He'll sift though a plane that went down in a storm -- -- find enough pulverized bone for six men heroically killed in the line of duty -- -- and just enough of the right kind of ash. We get twenty-one gun funerals and they write off fifty million. It's perfect, as long as you hold the plane steady -- so concentrate. On my way. That charge is going to blow both engines -- the plane'll go down like a rock, so clip yourself on to the end of the cable with the money as soon as I get over. And make sure you bring the right cases. Dip the plane. I'm coming over. Somehow, I didn't think you'd have waited for me if I'd sent it first. Get underneath the jet! The cases will slide over! Lower! Get underneath it! Now -- we call the police. Look -- I know there's a storm, but that wasn't thunder. Hal, when you've been in this line as long as I have -- Rocky Mountain Rescue -- come in, mayday -- Acknowledged, mayday. What's your position? Got to be Comb Bluff. Acknowledged, mayday. Winds are too strong for us to get a copter up there -- can you and your passengers make it through the storm? Over -- Mayday -- come in, mayday -- Maggie? Hi. Could you introduce us? Not the tag -- what do you call him? Poachers? Bastards... About four months, right? Christ -- it must have been just about his -- I mean her -- first flight -- You can't do that alone -- I'm making her nervous -- You hold her, I'll do the dressing. Got some fight in her -- that's good. What happened to Dave? I thought I came back to see if I'd learned to live with it. Well, big surprise. Coming back just tore me open all over again, like it all happened yesterday instead of a year ago. Nothing's changed. Including the way I feel about you. I didn't realize it till I saw you at the airport. But I came back for you, Maggie. No. Not here. I want you come with me. Start over, somewhere else. Now there's an easy call. What the hell do you want? I need your help. A plane's gone down on Comb Bluff. This storm would blow a copter all over the place -- but we can climb up to it. "We"? Talk to somebody who's still on the payroll. You've got a half dozen new guys -- -- who couldn't climb that wall now if there were stairs cut into it. But you've soloed it. During the summer. On a bet. This is a little more important than a bet. Just a few injured people with no first aid or shelter, camping in a zero degree blizzard. They'll be ice sculptures by tomorrow morning. Maybe you missed the headlines -- but I don't do rescues any more. They're bad for my conscience. Fuck this one up on your own. Play it again, Gabe, about how we killed her. I was there too, remember? Not like I was, pal -- her fingers brushed mine on the way down -- -- and I was the one who had to deal with her family when you fucking tore out of town. We lost her. Whatever anybody says about cold stress and the clip, you and I have to live with that. But right now, there are some more people who need our help, and they shouldn't die too just because you've got a problem keeping the past in the past. I don't want the responsibility. Walk away and you are responsible. They'll die. I can't do this alone. You know what else, Gabe? You can go anywhere you want, but if you don't do this, now, you're going to be stuck on that goddamn ledge for the rest of your life. That thing's dead weight. Completely useless for an ice climb. Just backup. I'll lead. I left a few bolts last time I climbed this -- I think I can find some of them. Save the rope for when it gets tough. That bet was for you to free climb the wall. Tell you what, Hal -- if we're still alive tomorrow morning, I'll give you the twenty bucks back, okay? Anchored! Rockslide! Anchored -- Anchored! You're sure this time -- Don't say it -- It's kind of hard to resist -- Have they arrived? Good. Return to the plane and cover your tracks. Come on -- the hard part's over. That's it. I thought the fuselage was broken. That looks pretty cozy. The pilot was hysterical. Something's wrong here -- Does this look like a prank to you? Come on -- Relax -- we're here to help -- Don't try to talk -- Where? -- Where? What are you -- You said "we". Where are the rest? What's for dinner? Ugh. "Dried Beef Slices With Barbeque Sauce." Try and make this edible. Hal Tucker. Where's yours? Gabe Walker... Very attractive. My ex. Too bad. Let me tell you what's on for today. We'd like you to help settle a wager. You see, we lost some luggage -- See these? Now I've bet the gentlemen behind you that you know enough about this mountain range to lead us to each of these, quickly, and that you'd be happy to do so. They bet me you couldn't and wouldn't. Now tell me -- who wins? Good dog. Now let's get this expedition started. Okay. Connect the dots. This way. We don't have to do this. We know these mountains -- they don't. If we can get ahead -- Can you climb faster than they can shoot? We've got to try something. Think we'll get a finder's fee after they get all their "luggage"? Sure. All the bullets we can eat. That's not what really worries me. There's something else to worry about? Yeah. Once they've got what they're after -- they're gonna need a copter to get out of here. Maggie. Hold it. It's up there. Fetch. I'll need the ice axe. You've got to be kidding. Okay. How about some tape? Crampons too. Where could he go? You win. Kill him when he gets down. Jesus. Lower it down -- now! I've got a better idea. Why don't you come up and get it? Get him! We can't. And he knows it. Come on -- You son of a bitch -- Get us out of here. What the hell -- Brett -- you're not going to believe this -- but a couple of guys are holding a gun on Hal and forcing him up the bluff -- I believe it. What the fuck is going on here? Let's catch up and find out. -- Come in, Rescue Unit -- over -- No tricks, no procedural codes, no personal messages -- just tell them everything's under control and you're taking care of the wounded. We've reached the wreckage -- top of Comb Bluff -- six injured, but they're responding to treatment. Everything A-OK. Over. Negative, Maggie. Winds are too high, and the passengers' injuries are all superficial. We're going to ride out the storm here -- over -- Have her come up. Forget it -- downdrafts would wipe her all over the peaks -- -- Not that I expect you to give a shit, but it's our only copter. You'll be stuck. Forget about it, Maggie, that's an order -- acknowledge -- You can't. He's taking care of passengers. Just like I should be. Over and out. Good. You might live longer than your friend. Now -- -- what? The next one's on top of the peak. This'll be long, but easy -- more like a hike than a climb. It looks like a winding route. There's a more direct route. The East Face. But it's the wall on the other side, and it's smooth as glass. Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather. Only a psycho would try it in a snowstorm. Okay -- I know it's not in San Francisco. I know it's not here. I know it's not in any fucking airport from here to Montana. Where it's not - we got that covered. Now, do you have any ideas on where it is? There's no radio contact, sir. At all. We're not receiving the tracer signal from the cockpit's flight recorder. Radar lost it after it went low here. We have to assume it went down in the storm. Air search? That storm hasn't quit yet. Weather service says we've got it until tomorrow morning at least. Even if we could get a plane up now, it'd be impossible to see anything on the ground. And -- -- The roads are shut down, right? Most of this area doesn't even have roads. Keep two copters on full standby. And let me know the second that storm starts to wind down. A steambath. A steambath -- and a bottle of whiskey. A steambath with a bottle of Glenlivet. And a fire. A steambath -- with a bottle of Glenlivet -- and a steak. A steak soaked with Glenlivet, cooking over a steambath on fire. Sorry, Gordon -- I promise I'll have it back tomorrow. Come on -- tourists take this trail. Is this it? Yeah. This is it. Good. Get out of the way. This way. It's over here! He's still alive. He's still alive! He can't be far away -- spread out! Put your hands on your head. Well -- look at the bright side. At least you've only got to make the split five ways now. Please still be there -- oh, please -- Mmm. Just like -- chicken. We've got a fix on the plane, sir -- we're getting a reading on the flight recorder tracer -- Any visual? Any radio contact? Not yet -- Get the copters ready. We take off in three minutes. The winds are still too strong -- Sorry to hear it. We're still going. The plane might be intact. Sir -- Shut up. That fifty million isn't coming out of my pension. Still interested in staying alive? It's up here. Somewhere on the Tower. There's a way to cross over to the top in about half a day. Show me. They're heading toward the opposite edge. An easy way down. I'll cut around this side, and wind up in front. You come up behind them -- quietly. And we've got 'em. Brett -- they've got five guns -- And you can collect them all after I get the drop on 'em. Let's get moving. End of the line! You heard me! Drop the guns! "End of the line"? That's classic. You've got style. So, I'm going to give you a three-count to figure out how to turn the safety off. Nice try. I've got one of these at home. Now drop 'em. Hey -- where's the other guy -- Brett, behind you! Time to -- What are we going to do -- You came up here to jump the spur -- This'd be a great time to do it. But -- Listen -- they don't know you're up here -- I'll draw their fire, you've got to make the jump and get help. I don't -- I -- uh -- Unless you want to do it the other way around? Come on -- wait till you're out of range -- don't pull it yet -- No such luck. Cheer up. Everyone should die in a spot this beautiful. Don't worry. You will. Maggie -- what are you doing -- Still a little breezy out, Mag -- Forget about it. He's smart, but he's not invisible. What can you confirm? Well, sir -- it crashed. That, I can confirm. We've been here just about one hour. These events take months to analyze. So if you'll excuse me -- No, I don't think I will. The reason the FAA pays you is to exercise your vast, amazing knowledge of these "events". So I expect you to come up with some stunning insights, something a slow-witted fuck like me hasn't already observed. One: it didn't blow up in mid-air, because the debris isn't widely dispersed. But was there a bomb on board that could have disabled it? I wonder. Two: There wasn't an attempted landing. Otherwise, there'd be debris to the east of the wreckage, where the plane was coming from. Did it come straight down? That's got me scratching my head too. And three: the flight recorder's tracer led us here in the first place. So where is the goddamn thing? That one's got me all aflush with curiosity. You'll be the first to know. Oh, I believe you. I thought you said there was an easy way across. There is. You might not like it much. Of course -- we'll have to do it hand over hand. Seems I forgot my harness. Sorry. Don't be. Lead on. I didn't need to see that. I really didn't. Got 'em -- they're under the trees -- Damn fool. Why would anybody try that in the middle of a storm. Should've taken that left turn at Albequerque. It's just like any other side move -- you can't see where the fuck you're going, that's all -- Much better. Maggie -- Maggie, this is dumb -- Look -- this part is nothing, believe me -- So much for the easy part. Then get the money, kill him and get back here. Now. Come on -- Here. Today, goddamit! This way. I like the outside of the mountain better too, but -- Stop. I need to stop. I'm glad to see you -- but Christ, I wish you hadn't come. Don't tell me -- Try it from this side. Do you still have your radio? Let's give it a try. I'm in bad need of a ride. Come in, Rescue Unit -- -- Come in, Rescue One -- -- Come in, Frank -- Is there anybody else on the radio? I take a year off and the department goes to hell. -- Come in, Rescue Unit -- Come in, Frank -- over -- You sick fuck -- Jesus -- that's some flare. Are you all right? No -- there could be another bomb up there -- even if there isn't, we could get another cave-in. The only sure way out is through the side. I've got something here. Let's have it. There's an unconfirmed report of a distress call made from a plane that crashed. That's really, really interesting, but This call was supposedly made from a plane that crash landed. After it landed. Sounds like they got it wrong. Next time you interrupt my work make sure it's something I can use. Come on -- we're almost out. What happened? Gabe, it's a dud -- Move! Thanks. We couldn't have killed him without you. Knock this in the side. Make it firm. Bad news. There's another bomb up there. We've got to move quick. Good news. There's a cave down there. Maggie -- come in, Maggie, this is Rescue One -- There's our ride out of here. Everyone out of sight -- except you, Kristel. Make the distress call. You're so good at it. Die. I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm sorry you got into this. He didn't think a distress call from a crashed plane was "important"? Get me a fucking radio! Now! Come in, Maggie, over -- I copy, Charlie Niner -- what's your position -- over -- Sit tight, Charlie Niner -- I'm right on top of you. Forget about it. He can't hear you. Tie these together. Tight. This is rope from the Gordon exhibit. The way guys climbed then, they'd tie on three at a time -- this rope'll take around nine hundred pounds. Yeah, they made it pretty good then. Each of these strands ought to hold about 300 pounds before snapping. Depends on how big a breakfast you had. You want to go first? Swing towards it -- and drop! What the fuck -- Don't worry. I'm here to help. Jailhouse load. First chamber's empty -- -- the rest aren't. Forgive me, but things have been a little strange this morning. Stop! You'll damage the helicopter. Answer that. Calling Rocky Mountain Rescue -- come in, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- over -- This is Ross Stuart, Federal Aviation Administration -- please identify -- over -- We have an unconfirmed report of an air crash in your area, and a distress call on this frequency -- can you confirm -- over -- Please repeat, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- distress call was a false alarm? -- over -- Not from you. Thanks, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- over and out -- I don't want to say I told you so. But I did. Can I go back to work now? I almost believed you myself. Goodbye, Frank. Time for number three. Unless you want to have a longer conversation with him elsewhere. Fuck off. I think I'll wait here. You just murdered three of my friends. Sooner or later, whoever's chasing you is going to show up and return the favor, and I'd love to watch. Suit yourself. You see, we just had a little interface with several branches of the federal government -- one of whose members I know has zero imagination -- and I can tell you, the cavalry just isn't going to make it by this week. No, you're taking us where we want to go. Because you want to return that favor and you want to do more than watch. You want to kill me -- more than anything, even more than you want to keep on breathing, and with a little more time you pray you'll get that chance. Am I right? Are you okay? This. That plane crash -- it's a half dozen guys who were smart enough to steal fifty million bucks, but dumb enough to drop it all over the range. They've got Hal as a bird dog -- and right now they're heading for the rest of it. It's close to the lake -- Hal's probably leading them on the slowest possible route down to it. I can get there first -- all I have to do is make it along the north wall to the Bitker ladder -- Something -- subtle. No way. You're climbing back down -- try to get to the station or find some help. And you're definitely not going -- Okay. Come on -- -- but the second you slow me down, I'm leaving -- -- I'm leaving you behind. Understood? One of the currency cases. We've tested the ash inside -- it's the right paper. What about the men? It's -- hard to tell. But forensics says yes. All of them were in the plane. Everything's accounted for, then -- time to head back and start making excuses. Fifty million bucks up in smoke, and I just don't give a shit. It's one more run of the press. But we lost five good men and they aren't so easily replaced. Especially a guy like Travers. Qualen. How far along are you? We have less than half a tank of fuel, Eric -- if we burn it up treasure hunting we'll never get off this rock. Now -- how far away are you? Time we have -- Walker's dead, Wright's an idiot. And our guide -- As soon as he becomes a convenience instead of a necessity -- kill him. If I don't go first, I might not go at all. Think you can beat my time? Shit -- she is in better shape. Quit sandbagging it -- I haven't got all day -- That -- tears it. You're not coming any further. Maybe. But I'm not getting you killed. Look, Maggie. I don't know what'll happen when I catch up with Hal -- but I've got to know one thing for sure -- that you're making it off this mountain. Alive. Get on the trail and stay out of sight. I'll see you on the ground. I give up. What was it? ID says this used to be your pilot. And we found him seven miles east of the wreck. A hijack. The plane was hijacked. Son of a bitch -- Oh, give me a break. Your pilot lost it when the flight started going south, and he bailed -- Excuse me -- but there's no parachute there. Check it yourself. Sir -- we found the flight recorder -- it was driven twenty feet deep into a crater. It was demolished, but we salvaged the recording -- I've heard a thousand of these, Wright -- whoever was at the stick is going to begin by screeching the Lord's Prayer and wind up screaming "Oh, shit" at ground zero -- -- the money's been stolen -- Travers and the pilot were in on it -- the pilot's dead, but Travers took the cash and made a mid-air transfer to a jet flown by Qualen -- controls won't respond -- shiiiiii-- Guess we're both right, Stuart. Thanks for your expertise. Well? You'll be waiting till Groundhog's Day for him to pull his head out of his ass -- let's get it in the air! Hasn't gotten any lower in the last year. Bitker, you cheap bastard. Would another four feet have killed you? Oh, no -- you didn't lose another one, did you? What about him? Tell me -- where would you like the first half dozen shots to go? As long as you're taking requests -- how about -- the base of your spine? Have you found the money? Good thing for Qualen you are. When he comes back, he's going to shoot you and the other guy, grab the money, and take off with Travers. He already blew up one of your pals in that crevice. And I've been in that copter. It goes a hell of a lot farther with two people than with four. Am I wrong? Give him a buzz. You've also got all the money. And I can show you how to get off the mountain with it. Right now. He's hiding twenty yards in -- be careful. He's right behind you! Something's moving fast down the hill -- is it Tucker? Answer me! Is it Tucker? Thanks loads. I couldn't have killed him without you. It's right over there. It's a storage locker for the rangers. Everything you need to get off the mountain is in there -- skiis, food -- I'll show you -- We'd make better time walking straight ahead. Qualen's not going to be hopping down the bunny trail too much longer. Don't fuck up. You still need me to show you a route off the mountain. Hop in. I know someone who'd like to see you again before he dies. Not any more. Nice outfit. I know you never liked the orange, but Didn't care for the Smokey The Bear hats, either. That's why I quit. You all right? I feel better than you look. I can live with that. Hardly seems worth zipping, huh? Frank? It's not over, Gabe. Travers took the helicopter. Qualen -- Kristel -- come in -- May I? They can't talk right now, Travers. Kristel's busy making snow angels -- and I'm not sure, but I think Qualen is still falling. Any messages? Maggie -- You wanted to make a trade earlier, Walker -- still interested? I've got the money. Fly to the lake. And if you touch her -- Now what? I have no fucking idea. Empty. Not for long. Why can't anything be easy? Stay over there -- Look -- let me -- -- what, throw snowballs at him? Just -- whatever happens -- get Maggie out of here. Count on it. And Gabe? Thanks for tagging along. Thanks for asking. I forgot how much I enjoyed rescue work. Come in, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- urgent -- come in -- Remember that bet you made? About whether I could find the money for you or not? You won. I'll kill her -- You do, and the spring thaw's going to be worth thirty million bucks. No rush. I'm sure you've got lots of time. All right. Drop the gun first. When she's safe on the ground. Get out. Run! Run! Now come and get it. My arm's getting tired. Don't you want to count it? Don't spend it all in one place, you son of a bitch. He's going to run Gabe down -- Cheer up. It's a beautiful spot to die. I'm no expert -- but what do you make of that "event"? Forget it. No fucking way. I'm staying right here. I've spent the night on walls before -- some of the best nights of my life have been spent lashed to walls -- Remember -- keep your arms and legs in the vehicle at all times -- Fuck you -- Jesus Christ -- you think you could have put a little less effort into that climb? I mean, what have you done for me -- lately?
