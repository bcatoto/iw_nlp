He has to know... We went through the door... <i> Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i> <i> I'm not the dumb one...</i> By name. Where're we taking him? He sure is big, Jack... Not at all! <i> Three of a kind...</i> <i> ... Let's draw straws.</i> Barrel.He's conducting experiments of his own. Uh-huh. I could. Of course I could. But no one would be like you... I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like-- Then we'll both starve... An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father... Whatever it is, it's none of your concern. There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell. Why not? Taste it. Taste it. What trail are you trying to throw me off now? Good. I'm hungry. Just what? But I guess my best just isn't good enough. I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here. That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off. People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home. Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there? If you went away, what would become of me? You're mine, you know. I made you. Didn't I tell you? I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I? For this. The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....<i> Listen now, you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.</i> <i> That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i> <i> Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i> <i> This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>Everybody knows about-- We followed your instructions. <i> I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i> <i> I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i> Lock. You'd better be quiet, Sandy. <i> Shut up and listen...!</i> <i> You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i> <i> ... Birds of a feather.</i> We're here! You sent for us!Where? And heavy... We can handle it. <i> Jack said we should work together.</i> Shock. Maybe he doesn't know... <i> ... You're no fun.</i> <i> I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i> <i> Now and forever...</i> Specifically.<i> -- It's a bat. -- Will it bend? -- It's a rat. -- Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i> <i> -- A bow? -- But why? -- How ugly! -- What's in it? -- What's in it?</i> <i> -- A box? -- Is it steel? -- Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? -- A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
