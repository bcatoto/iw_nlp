Couple more seconds! Is it still moving? Oh, man. That's no glitch! How? Can't see a thing. Are you sure? What? Where? What's wrong? Still got him? Careful of that edging there... But I'm going first... I'll come with you. Alright, okay. Look... What the hell are you doing? Fuck the bonus. I hate heights. You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night. Forget it, man. What? Are you nuts? Just the two of us? What? Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies. That's impossible, man. This fence is high-tensile. The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up. Take a look at this. Hey, Guttierez? Something spooking the rhinos? Yeah? That's what I mean. This is the quietest I've ever heard it. It's unnatural. Ah, quit griping. Keeps you in shape doesn't it? C'mon, man. One more sweep.Okay. Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system. I found the grating ripped right off. The little fucker was strong. York just turned up outside. We're trying to get him into Infirmary. Miss Noguchi! You're wanted in admin.We had to. They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate. Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway. Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick. Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too. That's also on the display. Uh-huh. Nah. It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation. Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running. Shit! Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores. We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones! No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy... It's alright, it's cool... I dunno. Might be a glitch. Wait. Lost it. Yeah, I... Just behind us, over to the right. I'm picking up another signal. Hold it, hold it... It's moving slow. About... eleven metres. On the left. Yeah, I got it. Anything you say, Mammacitta. What? Hey, fair enough. If you won't come, I'll handle it myself. C'mon De Vries. Think of the bonus. I've seen this mother, De Vries. We can bag it, no problem. Just got a reading... Whoa, wait a minute... That's a fact. There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop. One of 'em must have escaped. What? I dunno. Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself. De Vries? Listen to what? Hey! I was in shape before we started doing this. One more sweep... one more sweep. I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip. And, nothing. They checked out just fine. Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself. What's the problem?I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock. Anything else you wanna ruin my day with? Fucking great. I invested some money in them. Shit. When? And...? Appreciate that. She was running a little sluggish on the way back. Think the turbines might be playing up. Hey, Jan. See if you can get someone to check out the chopper. You have to... I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me. They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here. I don't...remember what happened next. Don't wait for me! Detour. Other way's blocked... I'm out of ammo. Get inside, get inside! What do I think? I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't. Cornering it shouldn't be a problem. Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers. If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power. That should give us ample time to find it. Do you believe him? Think I spoke too soon... Ah, don't worry about I.C.C. They're the least of your problems right now. Agreed. I've found Ackland! Yeah. Somebody won. There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to. Don't worry about it. If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days. They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us. All we've gotta do is sit tight. 'We'? You wanna fly out there with me? Nothing. With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us. Seltzer? What is that? Just curious. There's a lot of talk goes around. Only six? And before that? How long you been out here for now, anyway? Three months? Is that a fact. Not too much of the socializing type, then? Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh? Hey, boss. Wondered where you'd gotten to. See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away. Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers. The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics. Give me a yell is something happens. What time's sundown? You should hit the sack, too. How's it going? Tactical nukes, maybe? Jesus. Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range. They're making their own way back tomorrow.Yep... Oh man... Nah. I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds. 'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected. They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it. Thanks.Keep trying! Get her on-line. Now! And? Quick! Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit. Where is she? What? What's wrong? What is it? Give or take. Too many. Cassie, thank Christ! We're under attack. Seal everything now! A three-second burn to port, on my mark. Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS? We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure. That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same. Blow those suckers, Driscoll! Right. Auto-shop, you all set? Right. When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there. Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response. Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight. There's still time to back-out. It's not all good news. We had to take off the helmet lights. You'll be going in blind. Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds. Looks like it. Everything on this module is locked and sealed. We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate. Central Pumping. All the waste gets treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp. If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out. It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here... Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee. They've changed their heading again. Already working on it. Fort Powell. What do we tell 'em? Done it already. Nothing matches. That's what we thought. You got it, cowboy. 'Bout five minutes. Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so. Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop. Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too. Yeah, exactly. Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at. Where'd you leave them?Let's get back and call this in. Bloody big if it is. Top's open. I told you we... what's that? Yeah, it's fine. Is it dead? Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing. Do you wanna head back and call it in?
