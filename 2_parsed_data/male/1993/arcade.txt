Sure. Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype. Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor. He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening. Well...it involves a paradox. You have to trick The Boatman. Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength. You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys... If I tell you, then it's no fun. You can't. He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know? Like Fate. Each level you get progressively less time to complete. First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands. Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness. There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right. If you don't... You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are... Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem. First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind... On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in. If you're too late, The Screamer comes. It's a tough game. Hard to pin that bastard down. Keeps on changing the rules. Getting there. It's more sensitive than a joy-stick. Your video-character can respond as fast as you can. But what can I do for you? And maybe you've been taking too many drugs. He? Well, brain-dead anyway. Coma patient. It's really not all that important. It's the game's logic core. We actually patterned it after human brainwaves. I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible. Good question. See, that's where the fun comes in. ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat. Level Ten. That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found. The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here. On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world. Gotta time it right though. Sure. Every game's got 'em. I'll start with the schematics. I can print these up if you want. Yeah, who isn't.It's here!!! It's the wrong way! That way. Then we'll go home? Yes...Talk to me. Why don't we take this into my office. If this is a joke, I'm not laughing. You don't like it? Now what seems to be the problem? Security camera. Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live. Nick, Alex, how are we today? This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ... So what do you think? The game will guide you. It changes. There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe. The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain. In case things get too intense. It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather. Things can get pretty wild... Is it? Why don't you see for your self? A man after my own heart. Straight to the point. What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts. It responds like a human does. It learns. It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy. We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product. We think it's going to be a big seller. But you're the people that make it happen. You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at. It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.So how did you do it, Alex? Hold my keys, then. Sure. Never come back. Disappear forever. Come on. We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner. Good. Cause I'd freak if you weren't. So tell me you're okay, then. Listen to me, Alex. These counselor's don't know anything. They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.Thanks, Albert. Think you could print up those schematics? Could you play ARCADE with that? How the hell did you do that? Just tell me the fucking riddle. What's the riddle? How do you stop The Screamer? What do you mean? Does that thing work? What is it? We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard. Christ...no time... I don't want to talk about it. So that's what we almost died for? We can't reach that! What the fuck is that?! What?! There's nothing here! Shit... Hey, my strength's low. Look out for Fireflies. And we've still got time left. This was a piece of cake. Right, then... Okay. It's West. Which way do you think Level Two is? I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats. You watch the elapsed time and look for exits. That's what I was hoping you'd say. Thanks. Always wanted to do that. Don't even say it. Okay. Give us a kiss? We're actually inside, aren't we? I know. It sucks. I don't want anything to happen to you. I care about you. You don't get it, do you? No. If you're smart, you run like hell. I know how to do this! I'm good at these games. You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant. You're not coming, Alex. It can turn itself on, Alex! It doesn't need a quarter. I don't understand. It wants us to play the game. It's been taunting us ... A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces... Alex... Yeah. The Inferno. I've been thinking about that. ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started. You know, like his point of origin? Everything. Jesus Christ! Get that helmet. If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible. Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay? We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff... I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right? What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive. Drives 'em crazy every time. You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game. You mean we learn the rules... What? I don't know. Give me a break, Alex. What are we going to tell them? Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines. I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers... It's already out. Right. And then communication satellites, and then anywhere. It's growing. Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now... Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence. It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something. It's self-replicating...it mimics life. It's not just the cable system. It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. It's everywhere. That's what I thought. My house. I want to try something. We'll call 911. Look around Alex. We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here! Then leave her. What?! It doesn't necessarily mean she's... Where to now? Well? Okay. We'll see what's up. But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this. Life's too short, know what I mean? No way. It's not this weird. It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right? It's two o'clock in the morning. Go home. Go to sleep. We'll figure something out in the morning. It's the middle of the night. They're asleep. Phone didn't wake them. Sorry. Maybe I need the Valium. No it didn't. It's just a faulty relay or something. It happens. Quiet. I do have parents, you know. You imagined it. How?! It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think. They're not alive. It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive. Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that. And maybe he's in trouble. But it's not ARCADE that's doing it... Happy? I'm in the middle of it... What do you mean by "weird"? Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this. It's twelve-thirty! We are talking... What the hell are you talking about? Have you played the game yet? It's incredible! I was just... Hey, kid. So take his car home. Wait. I'm sure he's up to something... Hmmm. He said you were going to have dinner? Guess he took off... You have his keys, right? The Air-Force is working on the same thing. Sign me up. So how do I start? So what's the scenario? Am I saving a princess? Fighting Zombies? "Escape"? That's impossible. So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.I came from the city on the left. Actually, no. I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted... What's her problem? Sick? He's probably outside. You know how he is. Gets bored... What the hell does that mean? I am giving her a chance. Why don't you get off my back? So start at the beginning... I am The Liar. Where should I take you? Of course I can. I can say all sorts of things... Cool. Fucked up. That's what they said I was.
