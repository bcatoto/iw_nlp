To some guys, women are like a cheap  puzzle... with pieces that just don't  fit. They think the soul of a woman  is darker than a back alley... more  tangled than a telephone cord... and  colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada.  But those guys don't even have a  clue. When you know women the way I do,  you understand exactly what what  makes them tick... what makes them  hum... what makes them jiggle up and  down when they walk. And it's not  the kind of thing you can learn from  a correspondence course. There are two kinds of women in this  world... and I've known 'em both. One will take you for a fast ride on  a bumpy road with no seat belt. But  the other kind... Jeez... knock off the chatter, will  ya. Just trying to keep you awake, Arch. I'm awake! Where do you come up with  all that crap about women? It's true. Women are very complex,  but if you know how to read 'em...  they're an open book. You can always  tell the rotten apples from the  peaches. Are you kiddin'? I'd stake my career on it. Anybody  ever proves me wrong, I'll throw  away my badge. Aayyhh... women are trouble... I used to believe that too. Until I  married Lana. Now, she... is a peach. Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff,  pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a  beautiful wife waitin' for ya at  home. Everything a guy could ever  want, including NO kids. I'd love to have kids. What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break! Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes  you think Milo's gonna show up here? Logic. He knocked off all those banks.  He's got cash. He's gonna want to  spend it. This is one of the few  places that still takes cash. Sooner  or later... he's gotta turn up. And how we s'posed to recognize this  scumbag? The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you  see him... you'll know him. These are the best damn Nachos in  North America. Maybe the world! I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill.  You want some? Sure. No thanks. I have plenty. I'd be insulted, but I know you're  serious. I'm not as dumb as I look. Ravine. Ned Ravine. And you are...? I'm on duty. Cop. You lose. Who can say no to a weiner? You come here often? Oh! Sorry. Get something to wipe it off. I'll get you a wet paper towel. Hold it right there, Milo! Look out! He's got a weenie! Police emergency! I need your car! You take science in high school,  Milo? I skipped high school, cop! Then you're probably not familiar  with the theory of inverse  proportionate explosive dynamics. What about it? If you fire a weapon with the barrel  obstructed, the explosive force  multiplies by twenty-three point  five nine eight and reverses on itself  with diametric polarity? Yeah. So? The gun will blow up in your hand...  and it won't even scorch my pinkie. Ha! That's just theoretical  hypothesis. Inverse proportionate  explosive dynamics has never been  demonstrated conclusively in a  laboratory environment. Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart  guy. Let's find out. You have the right to remain silent...  next... if you waive that right,  anything you say... next... ...may be used against you in a court  of law... next... You have the right  to an attorney... Do you have an  attorney? Nahhhh! Then today's your lucky day... Yeah, well you're not so bad  yourself... for a lawyer's wife... Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When  does he ever find time for you? Maybe you should trade him in on a  new model. Want to go for another test drive? Morning sweetheart. No thanks. How long you been working on Lana's  Mercedes, Frank? Oh... I don't know... six, seven  weeks. And ya still haven't found the  problem? Think I got my finger on it though. I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't  born yesterday. He's not fixing your  car. He's SCREWING you! YOU are screwing my wife! I can see  what your game is, Frank. You open  up her hood, poke around in there...  squirt some lubrication in... play  around with all her parts... then  take an old used piston and stick it  in... then pull it out... in, out,  in, out! Every day! There's no end  to it. You just keep coming and  COMING!... and the bill just gets  bigger and BIGGER! But you don't see it, do you, Lana?  You're too good... too pure. You  can't see the evil in people like  him. Well, you're not getting away with  it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're  fired! Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late  for court. You are so naive. Finish your coffee... then GET OUT! Who's that? Laura... do you know where...? Yeah. Good idea. I don't know what I'd do without  you? Laura, how long have you worked for  me? And when was the last time I gave  you a raise? Naw. That's okay. You keep it. Did we forget something? Did we forget something? Laura. Laura! What is it? Maybe we should try some prune juice. Ladies and gentlemen... I ask you...  does this look like the face of a  crook? Of course it does. But the question  of my client's guilt or innocence is  not the issue here today. I'm certain  every member of the jury can clearly  see that he's guilty! I can't. Put yourself in his shoes. Look  through his eyes. See the world the  way HE sees it! Things just don't look the same.  It's fuzzy... and frightening! Ladies and gentlemen... Milo Crumley  is not the perpetrator here. He is  the VICTIM! Like ALL of us... this man is the  unfortunate victim of these tragically  difficult economic times. And what  does that mean? He can't support his  family! For God's sake!... He can't even  support his own FACE! Mr. Crumley... you cannot chew gum  in my courtroom... unless you have  enough for everyone. Bailiff. Pass these out. And don't forget the jury. And so, desperate and broke, with no  other options before him, Mr. Crumley  went to eleven Savings & Loans and  did what any of you would have done.  He stole back the money that the  S&Ls had stolen from him! Mr. Ravine... please approach the  bench. You're not running for congress here,  so knock off the speeches and quit  inciting these brainless morons! Now  pick up the pace and wrap this son- of-a-bitch up! Call your first  witness. I call... Detective Ned Ravine. I do. Detective Ravine, at the time of the  arrest, did you read the defendant  his Miranda rights? Of course. That's standard procedure. Are these the cards Officer Brooks  used to prompt you while reading Mr.  Crumley his rights? Yeah. These are them. Reading from the cards now... quote  "You have the right to remain silent,  if you waive that right, anything  you say... may be used against you  in a court of law." Is that right? That's right. WRONG! The official Miranda warning  is... "anything you say CAN be used  against you in a court of law." Not  "may"... "CAN!" Don't you know the difference between  "can" and "may", Detective? Every  school kid knows "can" is a verb  that indicates ability to perform,  while "may" is a verbal auxiliary  indicating the permission to act. I didn't have time to worry about  past participles or interrogative  pronouns! I was trying to protect  society from a deranged MADMAN! But this ivy league fop...!!! I have no more use for this witness. Mr. Ravine... I'm dismissing this case on the  grounds of improper grammar. Ow! But your Honor...! I know, I know. It's a technicality.  But it's the kind of technicality  that makes the American legal system  what it is today! Court's adjourned! I got busy. Here's that paper towel  I promised. How'd you get in? The door was locked. No... thanks. They're bad for ya. Only once. It was a fraternity prank.  I never saw him again. Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of  scum out there on the streets... but  they all deserve a fair and costly  trial. Oh... Laura... this is, uh... Gotta keep these darn books in their  right place or we'll never find the  ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M...  R thru B... W thru F... I have my car. Not today. You don't need to wait.  I'll see you tomorrow. Tomorrow... Try these on. So... what can I do for you? I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able.  Do you have the... papers... here? I'm on duty tonight. Yeah. Tomorrow. What's wrong with my office? I came back for my shower cap. Where is he? Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies  part-time. I got half a brain... or  didn't you notice? Standard accident policy... all the  usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The  face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three  million bucks! And there's a triple indemnity rider. Aw, it's just something agents throw  in so we can boost the premium. If  the policy holder dies under very  specific conditions, it pays off  three times the face value of the  policy. Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the  company. Nobody ever collects. Well, like here... it only pays off  if he's shot with a pistol, falls  from a moving northbound train and  drowns in a fresh water stream. See what I mean, sweetheart? What  are the odds of that? Then you'd be rich. What're you sayin'...? How we gonna do that? Didn't you  tell me he hates trains? Isn't that out of our way? You been thinking about this a lot,  haven't you? Stand over there and shut up! Hey, man, we got rights! Don't you  be layin' no deleterious malfeasance  on us. Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want  to hear language like that! Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy.  You seem a little tense tonight.  What is it? Aw... I don't know. I guess it's  Lana. It's just... I know she wants  to have a baby so bad... ...but I never get to spend any time  with her. And when I am home... it's  like she's, you know... avoiding  sex. You should try to be more sensitive,  man. More romantic. Bring her flowers. Try to understand how she feels.  After all... She may be weary... Women do get  weary... Wearing that same old shabby  dress... But when she's weary... Try  a little ten-der-ness... That can't be it. I'm the tenderest  guy on the force. Nah... I think  she's just afraid she won't be able  to get pregnant. What's to be afraid! It's like making  breakfast! You bring home the bacon...  she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it  up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got  an omelette in the oven! Why don't you knock off early... go  home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake  up in the morning and find you there  for a change. Naw... I can't. I got all this  paperwork. Don't worry about that. We'll do our own paperwork, man! Yeah! We'll fill out all that shit. ...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of  Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and  thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of  female! Smokes three cigars a day,  drinks a straight shot of vodka at  bedtime... and still has sex! Damn birds! I was. Who's in my office? Not again. Hello, Mrs. Shady. Laura... check on my insurance. Make  sure it's paid up. Gee, has it been seven years already? Well, being locked in a tiny room  with no TV can make a guy feel pretty  tense. I'm sure the experience wasn't all  negative. He probably made a lot of  friends... ...learned a useful trade... ...caught up on all those books he  wanted to read... I hate when she comes to see me. What's that? No... I mean that. I don't think so. Lau-raaaaa! Laura! Are you alright? That was a  very long flashback you had. Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked  me to take care of this. You smoke too much. It's hot tonight. Maybe we should look for a cooler  place. What're they lookin' at? I feel honored. Did you bring the... papers? Sure. I'll drive you. I'll follow you then. ...they'll think I'm a putz for  passing up a sure thing. Well, here we are... in the dark. You what? You know, these would work a lot  better if you took them out of the  boxes. Why don't we take a look at those...  papers? That's it? These are the... papers? This one's a laundry receipt... and  the other one's an expired lottery  ticket. Cash would be nice. I suppose you could wash my car. Hey... slow down... there's a speed  limit in this state. Sixty-five miles  an hour. Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three. Suppose I let you off with a warning? Suppose I put you under arrest for  being a bad girl with bad thoughts? Suppose I do and then we lose the  key and while I'm gone to get a  duplicate made the house catches on  fire and I can't get back to save  you because the bridge is washed out  and so you die a horrible death  toasted like a Polish sausage on a  flaming spit! Nah... I better be going. No thanks. I got a cold shower and a  wife who trusts me waiting at home. Don't forget to lock up. I forgot my car keys. Yes it is. It's time, Max. Mr. Shady! What's the first thing  you're gonna do now that you're out? Find Ned Ravine... rip his head off  and use it for a bowling ball! Are you a good bowler? You ever bowled a three-hundred game? How would you handle a seven-ten  split? Say, aren't you wearing one of  Ravine's "trademark" blue suits? Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a  gift... to make up for losing my  case. Now I'm going to wear it to  his friggin' funeral!! Ma! That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it? Oh yeah, sure... now I can hear it. Really? I never could understand the  lyrics. You know, what happened last night  was very, uh... But we can't ever let it happen again.  Ever! I wouldn't put it exactly like that.  It's just that... well, I'm married  to a wonderful woman... who is very,  very attractive... ...not that you aren't very  attractive! ...you aren't very attractive... you  aren't very attractive... you aren't  very attractive... Don't touch anything. You bond with  it... you buy it. Whatdya want? I'd like to buy a pet. Yeah. For what purpose? It's a gift... for my wife. Right. They all say that. She spends a lot of time alone. I  thought it might be nice if she had  something to keep her company. Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know  you're not the kind of guy who punches  out parakeets? Or takes some poor  defenseless animal, throws it in a  sack and runs over it with your car  five or six times. I would never hurt an animal. Boy, I would. They're driving me Shuddup! Okay... tell me more about this broad  you're married to. I like to match  people with the pets they deserve. Uh-uh. You do all my paperwork? Get out of here. And a damn good job, too. One of 'em  even did it in Spanish. Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours. ...I'd like to reach down Ned Ravine's  throat and pull out his guts with my  bare hands! Jesus... you hear that? He's just working through his anger,  trying to find a constructive outlet. Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The  guy's a friggin' looney! Trust me, I spent a lot of time with  him when I was preparing his case.  He's really a very sweet, sensitive  human being. I'd like to mash his head like a  ripe melon... He gets a little melon-dramatic. ...then cut off all his fingers and  rip out his liver with my teeth! See. Loves to exaggerate. Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit. Lieutenant Ravine. I told you not to call me! It's  finished between us. No. No, I'm not  sucking anything of yours anymore! It's done! OVER! Wrong number. How come we gotta meet here? What? Ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der  nisht geshtoigen un nisht gefloygen. Yo! Ober mir darfen imvarfen in tsug.  Un schissen un schtippen in vasser  arein. Oy a broch! Mir zenen git  bakackt. Ven hob ich gehat a vaichen schmoke? Nu shoin, ein mul. Es paseert tsie  yeyden man. Oy! Mir vellen zein oif groise tsures.  Me'vet unz chap'n. There's very little risk involved.  Statistics reveal that less than  thirty-two percent of all murderers  are ever apprehended. No. But I can read sub-titles. I didn't. It's for my wife. What? No there isn't. Who? I hadn't noticed. ...stick a knife in your... ...rip the eyeballs out of your... ...drive razor-sharp spikes under  your... ...cut it off... shove it in a  blender. He's just getting it out of his  system. Once they say it... they  never do it. You know... like the  President. Where did you get that? What are you doing with it? Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun  for? Laura... put the gun away. Flowers for Ned Rav... Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy?  Man, you are dead meat! What is it...? Why? What have you heard? Only part of the time. I promise I'll spend more time with  you. I know it's been rough, being  alone so much. But I'll make it up  to you. Maybe we should try again,  you know... to have a baby. Oh... I brought you a present! It's... sorta like a cat. It's a little skunk. I got it at  Birds-and-Skunks-R-Us. So... what're you going to name him? Yeah. Got a nice ring to it. I've  always liked the name Ned. So whatdya think? You love Ned Junior  as much as you love me? Frank? The only Frank I know is an  auto mechanic... but I sure as hell  wouldn't recommend the guy. He's  really slow. I told you, what happened was a big  mistake. A one night stand. It's  over. I have a wife... I hate opera! He's busy right now. Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a  big mistake! One lousy mistake in  his whole stinkin' life! So why don't  you give him a BREAK! Besides... he  belongs to my wife! I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey  for setting yet another unusual legal  precedent. This is the first time  I've ever tried a case in which the  JURY was found to be insane. The jury will be remanded to the  Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi  Valley. Court's adjourned. Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you  tell me? Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate! I insist. And I want to get you a  nice present. Yeah... aren't they great! They last  forever. And you can cut right through  a shoe with 'em! It's nice to be off the streets...  away from all the pain and misery  out there. Boy, does she look stupid in that  hat. Laura's incredible. And so smart.  Smart enough to recognize that Ginzu  knives are the gift of a lifetime. But she never goes out with guys. I  wonder why? But who cares if she... Oh, sorry. Go ahead... I insist... please... ...the Legal Symposium... ...tomorrow... ..."How To Sue Your Loved Ones." Yeah. I'm driving up in the morning. I'm a man, Laura. And all men feel  passion at one time or another. Even  me. What would you think of a married  man who gave in to those wild,  sensual, raging desires? What if, for just one crazy moment,  he couldn't resist...? He got knocked  for a loop and lost control? What if a tidal wave of lust crashed  over him and he was sucked into a  vortex of wild, thrashing urges? Well... it's not your problem. I'll  work it out. It's all taken care of. When do I  knock on the door? Oh, later... right... okay. See you tonight, Junior. This neighborhood is getting worse  all the time! Damn kids stole my  engine! I'll just fly up. Yeah. So? Dammit. I can't do it. You know how I feel  about riding trains. Yeah... right. A short trip. A short trip to hell in a metal tomb! And my brother, Jeff... My two sisters... My best friend, Al... my dog, Woof...  Grandma Rose... and Uncle Lionel.  All killed by trains! Yeah. I guess I can't bring them  back by not riding on a train. But I just can't get over this stupid  nagging fear that... I guess you're right. But we'll never make it to the  station. By the time a cab gets  here... I was in the neighborhood. Thought  I'd stop by and pick up my tools. Sure, I'll take you to the train  station. Twelve minutes. We'll never make it. We're not going to make it. We'll make it! I'll stand in the vestibule between  the cars. SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish  that foul smelling cigar? You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU  want me to put out my cigar? You  want ME to put out my CIGAR? Yeah. Certainly. You talkin' to me? You talkin' to  ME? You... talkin'... to... ME? Ticket? Sorry pal... automatic weapons are  only allowed in the club car after  nine p.m. I'll check it with baggage. You can  claim it at the depot in Santa  Barbara. Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years  old. Didja know if ya put a penny on  the track it'll make the train crash?  No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck?  My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really  neat. Everybody gets creamed! All  bloody guts... heads ripped off and  stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song  "Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy  Gopher Guts"? Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years  old. Didja know if ya put a penny on  the track it'll make the train crash? This... is not a toy! Yes it is. Here... let me help you with that. I try to be. Great green gobs of greasy, grimy  gopher guts... mutilated monkey  meat... chopped up dirty birdie's  feet... one pint jar of all-purpose  porpoise pus... cooked in a Mulligan  stew. French fried eyeballs and ugly scabs  you wanna pick... stuff to make your  mother sick... dog poop on a stick...  puke and snot all mixed together in  a pot... Oh boy! Here comes the tunnel! You shootin' at me? Yeah... you're definitely shootin'  at me. In this crazy world, there's not a  whole lot a guy can count on. But  when the chips are down, I can always  count on you. You risked your life to save mine. A  guy can't ask any more from a woman  than that. But I saw you shoot him, Lana. In  cold blood. I gotta arrest you for  murder. Sorry. I'm a cop. I have a job to  do. Don't worry, baby. I know a good  lawyer. What kind of gun did she use? That's a question for the arresting  officer. Aren't you the arresting officer? You'll have to ask her attorney. But aren't you her attorney? Only her husband can answer that. What will Mrs. Ravine be wearing at  the trial? A lovely powder blue dress with a  cinch waist, full bodice and a  delicately pleated skirt. Does it have a matching jacket? No comment. Is it cotton or rayon? I said... NO COMMENT! Did she eat any of the victim's body  parts? Jeez... they're really throwing some  tough questions out there today. Yeah... well I call it a "high-tech  lynching of an uppity white  housewife." What's this? Only cell available. They had that  serial killer locked up here... you  know, the one who talks his victims  to death then eats them... Hannibal  the Lecturer. But they let him out  for a three week tour to publicize  his new book. "To Serve Man." It's a cookbook. And look, look... he autographed it. To Arch... Love to have you for dinner  sometime... Hannibal. Very nice. They're waiting for ya. They didn't  want to start without her attorney  being present. Let's get the SWAT Team in here. Judge said no bail. Don't worry.  Just tell the truth, you'll be fine. Who's gonna handle the interrogation? It's your collar... your bust...  your call... your show... your play...  your move... your wife... Okay, okay!... I'll handle it. Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup  allowed in this building. Don't give us a tough time. Just  spill it! What were you doing on  that train? As your attorney, I must advise you...  you don't have to answer that  question. Alright, quit playing games with us! Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get  the gun? What's your link with the Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I  will not tolerate this unwarranted  badgering of my client. She'll have  her day in court, gentlemen. I want to thank you, Mrs. Ravine,  for being so cooperative with these  gentlemen. Did you get all that down, Laura.  Every word she said? NO! NOOOOO! NOOOOOOOooooooo!!! What? Where's Ned Junior? WHERE IS HE?! You can't just break into my house,  cook my food... borrow my skunk! Leave me alone. Stay out of my face!  Out of my neighborhood! Out of my ...the prosecution will prove that  this repulsive and degenerate woman  coldly murdered a decent, law-abiding  citizen... Objection! Move to strike. Hearsay,  irrelevant, stupid, idiotic, caca- doody poo-poo... Sustained. And can you tell us what this is? A FAX in which he threatened to puree  certain parts of my anatomy in a  blender! I'd like to submit this  into evidence. Objection! Who cares about the FAX  in this case? I'll allow it. And is this the blender you found in  the lavatory of the train? Yes... it is. I'd like this marked as evidence. Now would you tell the court, in  your own words, what you said to Mr.  Ravine? I'm really worried about this guy.  He could blow our whole case right  out of the water. Great green gobs of greasy grimy  gopher guts... mutilated monkey  meat... itsy-bitsy birdie feet...  Great green gobs of greasy grimy  gopher guts... and me without a spoon! That lady paid me two bucks to sing  it to him...! Recess! Ten minutes! Gotcha, dork face! Gotcha, gotcha! No way! Uh-uh! Missed by a mile! Mrs. Shady... would you tell us about  your son, Max. Was he a... a good  boy? But he got into trouble once in  awhile... like all kids do? And what, uh... what are these...? This is cute. And is this Max... with all the  tools... fixing his bike? Mrs. Shady! Do not POINT your finger  in my courtroom. It's discourteous,  impolite and disrespectful. Sit down! Did you encounter the victim... Max  Shady... on board the train? Yeah. And I told him... "this is the  NO SMOKING car! Would you please put  out your damn cigar!" And is that the cigar in your ear? I believe it is. I'd like the cigar and the head of  this witness entered into evidence. The defense calls... Lana Ravine! No, no dear. I'll vouch for her. Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you  Lana? I object! Sustained. Counselor... you will  address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine. Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell  the court... what were you doing on  that train? Do you want to have children? But you couldn't have children if  my... ...were... ...and, uh... So you followed him, knowing you had  to protect me... your husband...  your best friend... the man you  love... the future father of your  children. And when you saw that maniac standing  in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize  my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and  fired and fired and FIRED! The defense rests, your Honor. How can you convict a courageous  woman who risked everything to save  the life of her beloved husband? A  woman who acted boldly to stop a  demented maniac from doing THIS!... ...pulverizing the private parts of  the man she loves! Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the  potential mother of my potential  child. I challenge YOU to strike a  blow for motherhood and the American  justice system! Put the "con" back  in the Constitution. Put the "ju"  back in jurisprudence. Put the "can"  back in American. And put the "dom"  back in freedom. Find this woman  INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed  happy tonight! The jury's back! So... has the jury reached a verdict? Yes we have, your Honor. How do you find the defendant... on  the count of manslaughter? Not guilty. On the count of murder in the first  degree? Not guilty. On the Count of Monte Cristo? Not guilty. Good. Then on the count of three,  let's all get the hell out of here!  One... two... Wait... for... it... Two and a half... THREE! Mrs. Ravine! What can I do for ya? Yeah... the same gun that saved my  life. I'm sure it has sentimental  value. So... you did it. Ya beat the rap. Hey... I knew he'd spring ya. Heeeee-eeey... what could I do? Look... you're out... free. Now we're  together. That's what counts. We can  try again! Forget triple indemnity.  We'll whack him and split three mil. Come on, Lana. You're not gonna shoot  me. Now you're talkin' baby. Watch your step, guys. There's a lot  of blood. Looks like a suicide. We found a  note. It was stuck up his nose. "I can't take it anymore. I'm a  mediocre mechanic... and a lousy  lover." He's sure got that right. The "mechanic" part, I mean. I don't know why, Arch, but I just  can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't  suicide. Um? She told you her name was Um?  And what other lies did she tell  you? I've never seen this woman in  my life! Never followed her home!  Never had sex with her in the  refrigerator! It's all a sick  fantasy... and I deny everything! When will women like you learn, you  can't tear apart a perfectly good  marriage with your vicious lies...  Miss UMMMM! I know it's been a tough ordeal...  with the trial and everything. Tell  you what... let's take a trip. Yeah. Just the two of us. Great. Listen... I got something to  take care of. I'll be back in awhile. I just want to talk. No thanks. I'm driving. Stay away from my life, my wife, my  home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on  a vacation and when I come back, I  don't ever want to see your face  again! What are you talking about? You don't  know anything about Lana? How do you know her? Who is she to  you? TELL ME! Who is she! Who is she!? Liar! Who is she? WHO IS SHE! Him? Who, him? You wore the same clothes? What're you talking about? You two  don't look anything alike. You're beautiful. They did a terrific job! But... you're gorgeous! That's why you did all this? Seduced  me... harrassed me... the tape...  the flowers... the phone calls... It won't work. Lana loves me. Lana killed Frank Kelbo? Yeah. Why? Did he burn you on car  repairs too? The pieces of the puzzle were falling  into place and I didn't like the  picture they were making. If Lana  really killed Frank Kelbo, then I  had misjudged her by a mile. Sure...  he was a lousy mechanic. But murder? It was all starting to give me a  headache bigger than the national  deficit. Lana? Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab  a chair. So... what have you got? How about Ovaltine? I'm way ahead of you. So that's where she hid the Oreos. That's the craziest thing I ever  heard. Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters. This is so unbelievable. That damn faucet keeps turning on  all by itself. I'll go check it. I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a  gig tonight. Forget something, sweetheart? You forgot to flush, darling. You were right... there's a million  things I don't know about women.  Maybe you can teach me a few hundred. Hell... I had too many careers anyway. HUH?!!! Great. So... maybe I was wrong. Maybe women  really are like a big jigsaw puzzle...  with pieces that never seem to fit  where you want 'em to. All I know is, there are three things  that men can't possibly ever do... ...understand women... give birth...  and program a VCR. And giving birth  is the easy one. Yeah, Laura? No. But if you hum a few bars...  I'll fake it.
