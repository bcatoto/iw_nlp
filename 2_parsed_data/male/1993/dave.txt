Die, you pond scum! Fine? You're fired. Oh... I'm fired? ... what? You're lint! You're a flea! You're a blip! You're nothing. Do you understand me! You're NOBODY... Share... What do you think you're doing?! Choices??? .. Nothing. Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today. ) Listen, you little... Alan The Washington Post. What the hell is this? Mr. President... Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony. All you have to say is `thanks for doing this, Ellen.' Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody. Dave... I'm not certain about... First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms. Alan has put together sort of a training program Right and don't embellish. For a month. Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love... Don't worry about it. Now, remember -- keep it simple. We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door. It happens. This is where you'll be sleeping. They barely talk anymore. Don't worry. You won't even see her. How much do you usually get paid? No more than the usual. What? Don't say a . Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo... You understand what you'll be doing? ... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher... Are you threatening me? What do you mean by that? I'll lock him away for good. Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free. I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!! It's not his job -- It's my job! Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter? What I told him to? I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people. He's not a President! He's an ordinary person. I can kill an ordinary person. I'm going to kill him. Do we have anything on the budget today? Oh. Fine. What's with the cameras? No!... WE didn't anything... Three years. You're kidding. Alan, we still have to control this guy... When does it break? I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President! Oh. Excuse me. You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady? Are you out of your mind? If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up. Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months. The whole thing is under control. Nobody's got clean kids. Check his kids. What about the wife? No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean. What do you mean, he's clean? I just hope this yutz can pull it off. Fine. And... What about her. Is that everybody? What about containment, Alan? I was a senator, you know. It's simple, Alan. We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one. The whole thing takes a few weeks tops. We think so. A condition... Soon. Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon. Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke... Look, everything can be handled. We'll just find a way to handle it. TilT we figure something out. This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him. And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States! I don't give a shit. Just don't call him, Alan! Don't call the Vice President! Nightmare... Where's the girl? I can't believe he'd do this.I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.' So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts. Fine. Fine... Yeah. I said you're fired. Go on -- get outta here. Well, maybe I am. But you're fired. I'm... not... nobody... You mean the press conference? I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country. Yes, Bob. Choices... Now the Commerce Department.., Great. Well it's a last minute change. Lots of shelters were in this bill. That shelter was in this bill. No... What the hell is this ? I mean, if it's a problem... `Thanks for doing this, Ellen.' ... Alright. It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung... Hands to the side... Oh, sure. Remember the convention speech? Great. I promise. I won't. A month. And we're going away for a holiday. What's with her? Don't worry. Oh... Okay. Holy cow. You're kidding? First Lady... Uh -- I don't know. Sometimes it's just like a barter thing... Is this legal? The usual... Is this dangerous or anything? Uh --Mr. Alexander? Right. `Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean, if you wanted me to talk or... Yeah... You just want me to wave, right? Well -- take care. Thanks. You did great. Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something. It's alright. I know what you mean. Let's start at the top. So what do we do? You could buy it on payments. Choices? I'm not surprised. Can we save anywhere? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I am the government. And who's gonna find out? I don't think so Why would they do that. They hired me. It's fine. Oh. Okay. I'll catch ya tomorrow then. Oh yeah... Me, too. You want to get dinner later? So you want to go swimming? Now he's making stuff up about me. She knows. We've got to fix this. Alan... This is wrong, Alan! What do you mean you made it all up? Let's call it a night. I can't take any more. But we went there. We saw those kids. We vetoed that? Quick. Gimme a quarter. Gimme a quarter. Fine. Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something? I thought you said I wasn't going to see her. '... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...' 'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...' Hand on the heart... ... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...' That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there. At a press conference. Presence. Oh. The teleprompter. Is it hooked up? A teleprompter. I see what you mean. In the car? Well... I gues I would... Yeah. I'm not sure... I might have. Really? Crazy? No. Will he be alright? Oh my gosh... What happened? Oh my God... Extend things? Look, I'm sorry. I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited... Oh yeah... 1'm fine... Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars. Do you want to tell him that? So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought? Why? Perceptual? Does it make the cars any better? You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to... 'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.' Oh... Kinda the same way. Really? You know. Your first campaign. You ever think back to how you started. ... Sometimes they do. Yeah. Oh... Hi. I just fired Bob Alexander. They re not my attack dogs. The Fidelity nonsense... Something like what... Certainly. Ah. What are they? Oh... Thanks. Thanks, Duane. No thanks. It's not that far. Well... Oh... right... You know, ever since the stroke... Who? Oh, sure. Don't worry about it. Didn't mean to bum you out. But Bill was your king, not Bob. You're kidding. What's that? I was waiting for that jack. Call Bob and Reed. Tell them I need them immediately. Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life. Huh. You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President. You ever use it? You got a gun? So you just protect the President the whole time? That's your whole job? Oh. You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say. So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady? Really? Really? What? You're not? Oh my God... I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes... It could be fun. ... Not exactly the Oval Office. I missed... I never thought I'd... I saw you on T.V... at his funeral. It's nice. Hi. What? Yeah. And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart. Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little... What's wrong? That's okay. I know. I'm sorry... What? Well I guess... It was okay? I know. Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it. Yeah. Is that funny? You know, secretaries and stiff. I run a temp agency. You mean when I'm not running the country? I guess. That's a secret. Just wait. I'm starving. There's got to be something open around here. Are you hungry? In fact, I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that. I'm not Bill Mitchell. What? He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days. I don't mind. Truman used it all the time. How were you gonna get home? I never wanted to hurt anybody. In fact... I even thought I was helping. Just souvenirs. Towels and stuff. Where's home? Where are you going? You're leaving? They asked me to help. I don't know. Oh yeah? Me, too. Anybody would have done it. No. Oh... Yeah. ... . Ellen. Look. If there was some mistake... What's wrong with a magic trick? I don't understand. ... How could I what? I care about the homeless. What? Thanks for doing this, Ellen? You bet. Thanks for doing this, Ellen. Uh...I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave. You sure you don't want a lift back home? Well... The Vice-President... That's okay. You alright down here by yourself? Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco... No... They don't kid. First thing they teach you at the academy. `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.' `Bleed for your king.' You mean with you and everything? I had a feeling. But it's ten-thirty at night. Certainly. What about it? No. Of course. Yeah. I can't say. I can't say. We'd like to hire you. On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations. Your government needs your help. No. Mr. Kovic. We're not here about your taxes.Fabulous. Oh yeah. Did you take care of later on? Who's this priest I'm thanking? It better be. Last time you had me introduce a dead guy. What about the intro? Try to find someone who looks like me this time. That last guy was a joke. Did you get someone to double for me there, out front? The Monroe? Dammit... I told them no mayo. See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...That'd be great. Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres... Yeah. That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit. You know -- priorities. Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano? Well, yeah. But you gotta start making some choices. I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be. I gotta tell ya, Dave. I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up. Who does these books? I gotta tell ya, Dave. I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up. Who does these books? The government This is undeclared income. They could put you in jail. I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this. I was gonna do something with Joan. Dave -- I'm working.Jesus... Uh-oh... Sort of... Yeah. Just what you think I mean. Then we'll all go to jail together. Don't do this. Bob... He was only doing his job. I heard you. You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.' He's only doing what you told him to. Bob... You can't kill a President. What are you gonna do? I don't think so. Hundredth cabinet meeting. I thought it was a nice touch. Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes... I'm telling you, Bob, it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage. How long have you been waiting to pass that thing? And look at this. Russell came around on the trade bill. Couple of days. Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers... Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on? It's gonna be great. 'Caring about his wife.' 'Spending time on her favorite issue...' It's a homeless shelter. Uh, let me get back to you... Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th... You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months! We've got nothing, Bob. This won't work. Clean. Clean. The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob. He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return. I mean I've checked everything. Women. Liquor... Finances. I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president. Clean. Everybody else is buying the minor stroke' story... I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever. Her?... Oh -- the First Lady... She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr. I managed to catch her before she left the hotel. Duane's guys, but he's got them under control. I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC. Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres... You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President. Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken? Yes. Exactly. A condition. Up and around? Soon? Mild stroke? Like how? Bob, the guy had a stroke! Till what? Bob... The guy's in a coma, Bob. ... What? Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President... She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room. I know. They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable. He's not. `Dave'? Absolutely. Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood... Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad. It's really embarrassing. But it was Bob's idea. Wrong... We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy. Right. We can pick up on the rest tomorrow. Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing. Even I don't understand it sometimes. Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and... President vetoes works bill? What? Fine. She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell. It's just five minutes. She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves. Dave! Dave... Thanks, I wrote it. What? Right. Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat... I don't think so. What? Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first. You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to... In the car. Now, let's say the whole country. Was in that car. The entire United States of America. Well, let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital. You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you? You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around... I'm afraid so. Oh, yeah... probably... It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape. Well, it's... It's sort of an... an `incident' really... I know... I know... It's difficult for all of us. But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country. Extend them. C'mere for a second. In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit. We're not upset with you, Dave. We think you did a terrific job. Don't we? Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it... You sure? A Coke or a Perrier or something? All set. Father Mclntire. He blessed you at the inauguration. It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech. We're all set, sir. We're doing our best, sir. We're working on it. Uh, yes, sir. The Monroe Hotel... I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year. The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet. We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
