Adele for god sake please lis... Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else. I suppose anything's possible. No. What happened to Adele? They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here. Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back. Forget about it, doesn't matter. ...Ha. If you say so. No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there. Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me? Yeah? By the way, I'm not much of a pool player. Sure. Yeah. I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him. Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society. Dahlia, no. That bad? He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down. Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred. Who? It's just a work in progress, kinda rough. How much do I owe you? That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed. So what do you do Early? Brian. Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early. Tight fit. I don't know. I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free. Carrie, watch for Early. Then try again, You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you. Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up! Carrie... stop it. Why, what did he do? Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too. Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos. There's more... A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything. What is it? Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state. How do you know that? Who said he's my good buddy? Take your time. All set? Carrie. ...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all. I heard that. Bitch, bitch, bitch! He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him. We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes... Lighten up... Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance." "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!" Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember? I like that. Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.' We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out. What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California. "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean." A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it. Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together. Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger. ...and I think I know why. ...I think it's the best stuff I've done. Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing. Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you. ...just like that? Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we... ...I do. Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral. The warehouse. I'm not that drunk. Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting. A... I gotta go. Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake. Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit. Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches! What's wrong with her? Well Adele... it was for... ...saving your fucking life back there! Thank you for what? What are you thanking me for Adele? Yeah but, what is it? What the hell is this stuff? Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here... Do it Adele... Now! Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper. Shush, Adele. As many times as it takes. You just smile, let me do all the talking. Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now. They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers. I heard that. Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it. Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon... Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn... ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month... Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact. What's up Adele? Dinner ready? Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there. Happy birthday Adele. You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it? What do you need a Bible for? Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think... Never heard of it, any huntin'? Where you from Walter? I don't know. Wish I did. Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that? What's your name, boy? Well, let's put it this way. I need me a new woman. You two been busy in here. ...and? So tell me... what happened here? Hell it don't... ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table. Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri? Ya see what I'm sayin'? Ha! Damn right I do. ...Well then, that's how many I killed. ...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it. Nah... how much money have you got? Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game. Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know. Ain't you goin' to record it? You wanna hear mine? That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it? You don't sound too convinced 'bout that? Now why is that? ...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh? ...Then some. How did he get away with it for so long anyhow? Wonder what all them people done made him so mad? Henry Lucas. This guy killed a mess of people. This the book your writing? Forget it. Can't hurt. ...Too bad. You gonna talk to the people who did those murders? Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to... Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite. Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler. Best kind. ...You know what I mean? You were plenty hot. Who d'ya think you're foolin'? I know you better than you think... Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand? Everybody just shut up! Shut your mouth. Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta. ...never? Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that? Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight? ...Need a hand with those bags? She wasn't feeling so good. Bri'. Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job. What is it? I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for? Wasn't my fault......Janitor's job. You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp. ...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day... You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there. Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger. ...Diebold? No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this. Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas. Could be. His Parole Officer. What happened?Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems. ...That'd be my guess. What about the owner of the house... ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be? Without his car? Where would we find him? Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy? Who are you?
