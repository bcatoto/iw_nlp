Come on.  You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you next week.  I already bought the earplugs.  God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.  You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.  Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.  Thank you.  I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.  We bought a treadmill last week.  Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a while. That was her problem.  It is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never meet them... You guys...  Well, anyway... good night. CAROL (voice over) Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that...  There's a movie on television I want to watch.  Now, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail. Very rare... and very beautiful.  Yeah.  Look at that. And this plate block is quite unique because it has a flaw in the engraving. See if you can see it.  Uh, it's hard for me.  Actually I'll give you a little hint. Right down here in the corner.  That tiny thing there ?  Interesting, yeah.  Ah, you have a really...  That makes it quite valuable, you see. And I just got a commemorative set of issues that are going to be quite valuable, too.  Yes.  Look at the color, right there. All these are gonna become a real f...  Well, listen... we're probably keeping you up, right ?  Oh, no-no-no. This is wonderful.  I should be going.  What do you do, if I may ask ?  Me ? I'm in book publishing. I work up at Harper's.  Are you really ?  Yeah.  I own an old, uh, cinema. Having it redone.  Oh.  Used to have a string of three, but, you know, business is not what it used to be.  Now, look at these presidentials. Look at the color work. Even the perforations are still intact.  Where's Carol ?  All the...  Because I should really be going, actually.  Oh, really ?  Yeah. I mean, so, we...  Oh, coffee. I forgot coffee. PAUL (voice over) Good. We can get back to this later. Come on in.  Nice color.  Always regretted it. I think knowledge is the second most important thing. First is health, then knowledge, then money.  You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just...  Oh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal position and have you in bed screaming for a month.  Well, what do you buy the woman who buys everything ?  Well, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste. You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs.  Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even know her size. I'm going over.  Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little longer in there ?  I was signaling you frantically.  Neighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you know, look at canceled postage.  Oh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie. I don't know why they put it on so late.  No, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the San Andrea's Fault.  I don't think you have to worry about that.  Well, I don't think he's... no, he's not doing... Come on, he's not doing well at all. He's not used to it.  Yeah, yeah. This.  So what do you want to do ? you guys gonna browse, or...  No, we're gonna go to a movie.  Why don't you come with us ?  Oh, not too much, I guess. Just twenty-six year experience... All the percentage there is, and this hunk of concrete in my stomach.  Yeah, I... I... it was one of my favorites.  It just... they were all so wonderful, in the picture.  Ted ?  Well, I don't know. Ted... I always thought Ted had a crush on you.  Yeah. Why are you so stunned ? I think that...  Uh. Now he's divorced, you know ?  Oh, is that the-that the E.M.S. ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over) That guy's so excited. ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over) The doctor and the E.M.S.  What's the matter ? What's going on ? What happened ?  She had a heart attack. CAROL (voice over) Oh my God !  Sh-She's dead. LARRY (voice over) She-she's dead ? CAROL (voice over) Dead ? NEIGHBOR (voice over) They're giving Mr. House a sedative right now. He's running around like crazy.  I called E.M.S. and they got here as soon as they could, but it was too late.  Sh-We just met her last night. OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOR (voice over) Awful, just awful. LARRY (voice over) What happened ?  Well, it was a classic coronary. She just went like that.  Oh, my God. DOCTOR (voice over) You can be good neighbors. You know, we calmed him down, uh...  Th-Th-Th-The first time we saw them was last night. We just met them. W-We had... They invited us in for coffee.  Such a... S... Such a nice lady.  You look wonderful.  Hi.  Thank you so much for those wonderful flowers.  It was quite nice of you.  If there's anything we can do. You know, anything you need, just tell us and we'll...  Yeah.  She had a heart condition.  Ah.  She wouldn't have.  If there's anything we can do.  You know, if you need anything, if you are lonely, come by. You know.  Thank you. You know, you owe me a wonderful French dessert.  Well, have a nice time. You seem all gussied up.  Oh, enjoy.  My favorite, my favorite.  Goodnight.  Goodnight.  Come, we're gonna be late.  I can't listen to that much Wagner, you know. I start to get the urge to conquer Poland.  I'll tell you something. I think it's weird. I mean, listen to this. One night she's having coffee, and the next night they are carrying her out in a rubber bag.  Maybe this guy killed her, you know ? Like, he's got, like, a young tootsie stashed someplace, or something.  No, no, not this... you gotta, you gotta see this guy. This guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage stamps. He's a-a boring old...  Well, I can see that. Yeah, depending on whose picture is on the stamp.  Well, what is she gonna say ? Oh, yeah, hello, I'm Mrs. House and I have a bad heart.  It is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is to talk about a heart condition.  You said she liked... she liked eating high cholesterol desserts. Is that what you said ?  So, she had one too many.  So she wasn't on a diet. But...  This would be a really great way to kill somebody.  How ?  You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate mousse, butter. They go like that.   Yes, I had...  Yes, but a restaurant is a serious business. I mean, you just can't take that lightly. You can't be cavalier about a restaurant.  Do you know how time-consuming it is ? Yeah. You have to be there every night.  Absolutely.  You'd be stuck there, you know.  Wait. Look, look.  They steal from, if you're not... You gotta be hap...  She'll cook... She's great. She's-She's a pro. She's a pro. She'll be cooking... She'll be cooking in the kitchen. I'll be at the front, running the joint like Rick, you know, in «Casablanca».  It's not that easy.  Right. Directs...  I'm set, I'm serious about it. I don't... I mean, it's not like a hobby. I mean, it's gotta be a serious thing.  I'll be the first customer.  You know, I was thinking of fixing Ted up with Helen Dubin. You know, I figured they would just, you know, get into an argument over penis envy, or something.  The poor guy suffers from it so...  No, he seemed like his regular self to me, but-but, uh, when you brought up the notion of the restaurant... the guy lit up like Mr. Glowworm.  Yeah. He sees himself as, uh, you know, as Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. I-I see him more as Peter Lorre, wringing his hands.  Right. Meanwhile, I can't get the-the Flying Dutchman theme out of my mind, you know ? Remind me tomorrow to buy up all the Wagner records in town and rent a chainsaw.  Yeah ?  Well, he's a little mousey, too. They could have their little rodent time. They can eat cheese together.  Oh, Christ.  Hallo ? Yes. Yes, of.... Yes, of course you woke us. You know, not everybody's up at one o'clock in the morning watching the porn channel. I'll put her on.  Ted. For you.  I figured out how he killed her and made it look like a coronary. He gagged her and tied her to the treadmill, and then he turned the exercise program up to the Olympic levels.  Jesus, are you onto that ? My God, I thought you were just joking.  Let me speak to him, all right ?  Hey, listen. She was not murdered. She... she had a heart attack. It was a coronary. There was a doctor there. He said to.... He was an old man.  How do you know it was a real doctor ?  I'm not gonna touch that. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. Look...  Wait-wait-wait a minute, wait a minute, put Carol back on, I called about something else. Listen, I know a great location for a restaurant.  Hah, look at this. Isn't this great ?  Aren't these walls great ? A cave, you know, like you have to go through a little cave.  And then you come out, to this here.  Yeah. Isn't it great ?  No, no... that's the appeal. That's just the appeal, because it's... it's, I mean it's so romantic... tucked away back in here like this. CAROL (voice over) Yeah. TED (voice over) And, you don't want street traffic. You want... CAROL (voice over) No. TED (voice over) you want a little out of the way spot that people hear about and lovers go to. CAROL (voice over) Yeah. TED (voice over) It takes months to take a reservation, you know ? Very few tables. CAROL (voice over) You know, you've really thought this out. TED (voice over) Oh, well, I used to come here all the time with-with July, when we were married. CAROL (voice over) Uh uh. Right.  Used to walk around here. Really beautiful at night. It's gorgeous at night.  I used to think, «What am I doing here with July ? We don't love each other any more», you know ? It made the moment doubly poignant.  Hi. How are you ?  Oh, my...  I love it. Come on in, come on in.  This is unbelievable.  Did you do it ?  Well, come on in.  Would you share it with me ?  Oh, no. She made these just for you. This is...  No, no, no, it's too much for one. I'll I make some coffee. Please.  They're only half a dozen.  Oh, you've already done so much.  Aren't you nice.  She worked on those for... How're you holding up ?  Oh, I don't know. I was thinking after a while. I'd get away from here. From this place and all its memories.  Uh uh, so you have someone to go with, or are you...  I have a brother in Florida.  Oh, really ?  I'm hoping he can get away for a while.  Good. It's a good idea.  Do you like snorkeling ?  Snorkeling ? No, no. I get nervous when brightly colored fish are staring at me face to face, you know.  Hey, I've got some stamps I wanted to show you.  Oh, stamps. Well, that's...  Come on, look at these.  This is very delicious.  You are an artist.  Oh, no. We had... very few friends, no family.  Yeah.  Uh-huh. Yes, yes. We were. We were spending the eternity with the beloved. I sound like... I sound like one of those guys, now.  Yes. CAROL (voice over) Yes but, I was just wondering where, um, where is the cemetery ?  Oh, it's... uh, in... uh, it's in Nyack. We used to summer there occasionally.  What was all that stuff about twin cemetery plots ?  You know ? I mean, we-we never discussed it at all, but I knew that you were trying to tell me something, so I picked up on it quickly.  But I... You know, we...  Ashes ? Funeral ashes ? Did you wash your hands ?  How did you know it was her, for Christ's sake ? They were ashes. What, did they resemble Mrs. House ?  Anybody. Could it be, an associate, an old relative, his accountant, his cat. Who knows ? CAROL (voice over) Right, right. Hidden, uh ? Hidden away ?  What do you mean? Th-th-the guy didn't do anything.  Oh, Jesus. Leave the guy alone. You know, he-he... he's a poor widower, he wants to go on a vacation or something. CAROL (voice over) Yeah. Where ? Oh, I know where, ah ah. Snorkeling, right ? Ah ah.  So what ? Different strokes. You know, he has fun, uh, sitting at the bottom of the water, face to face with squid.  Too much «Double Indemnity», you know ?  That's what you do if you don't want an autopsy. You don't want something discovered, you know ? Like-like poison.  Uh, I don't know. There's a lot of different kinds of exotic poisons, you know ?  Jesus, you're up to poisons already. You guys are slipping into a mad obsession.  Let's go to bed. Could we go to bed, now ?  What do you mean, «You're not tired» ?  Great.  Well, New York is a melting pot. You know, get used to it.  Hey, are you okay ?  Yeah ? You're sure ?  So-So-So what ?  So what ? It's not a crime. He can get on the elevator.  Oh, Jesus. I was in a deep sleep. What-What's the difference ?  All right, so it was Mr. House. So he got on the elevator. It's not a felony. The guy pays rent. He's entitled. I mean, what... Can you go back to bed ? This is crazy. You woke me up out of a deep sleep. I gotta get up early tomorrow morning.  Don't ring Mr... What are you doing ? No, don't ring...  Don't ring Mr. house. This is a widower. Leave the poor guy alone. You're crazy. Stop it.  So you saw him go out. It's not a-not a crime.  Give me this. Give me this.  Look, if you want to find out if somebody left, just call downstairs. Call the-the-the person at the desk.  Ask if someone went out.  Yeah, um. Sure, I'm gonna keep ringing. You got it.  Okay. Are you happy ?  Now, can we back to bed ?  For crying out loud, it's no big deal. You're making a mystery where nothing exists.  You know, I'm gonna...  I wanna go to sleep. I don't want to be standing here in the middle of the night.  Oh, great ! Great ! So what ? Now, what've you got ?  So what ? So what ?  What's the big deal ? So, the next-door neighbor went out in the middle of the night and took his car. So, he went someplace.  That's all.  I mean, so you're right. So big deal.  But this kind of right is gonna put us in the toilet. So, you're right. You're suspicious.  It says more about your mind that about him.  Get into bed. Get into bed.  You're so... What's wrong with you ? Jesus !  Well, yeah. Yeah.  Sure.  But I... I got...  I'll be back in about a minute.  Okay, just wait a second. I'll be right back. CAROL (voice over) Yeah. Okay. All right. Oh, God.  Hallo ?  Listen, I'd get out of there right away, if I were you.  No, no, no. Go, go, go. We'll do... We'll talk more from your apartment.  Oh. Hi. How are you ?  Good morning. How are you ?  Good. You got the notice on the... Uh, maintenance increase ?  No. When did that happen ?  Yes, it's crazy. But soon, we'll be too old to do anything crazy. Go, leave, leave, leave.  Hallo. PAUL (voice over) Oh, hi. Yeah. I know. I-I...Yes, I miss you, too. I did. I made all the arrangements.  Yeah, look. I... Okay, I have to run. But I'll see you later, okay ? Okay. PAUL (voice over) Extension five. Well, keep ringing, would you please ? Because I just talked to her. What ? Okay. Uh, will you tell her... yes, tell her that Tom called. Tom. Thank you.  So, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little bit, but, uh...  That's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry about, you know ? This book makes «Finnegan's Wake» look like airplane reading, you know ? But-But it's long. It's- It's-It's...  No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great. Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own life ?  Oh, really ? Do you still play ? MARCIA (voice over) No, but I still know how.  Yes ? Are you good ? MARCIA (voice over) Yeah.  Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers. MARCIA (voice over) I could turn your game around in two hours.  Could you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is, uh, too good to be true.  Okay, you sold me. Are-are you seeing anybody ? MARCIA (voice over) No. Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade. Why do you ask ?  Because I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I know he would get a big kick out of you. MARCIA (voice over) Oh. So, when do you want your poker lessons ?  Uh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we could, um, I'll put you on my expense account, and you could... teach me when to... bet and when to fold. MARCIA (voice over) How about a cheeseburger right now ?  Now ? That's a possibility.  You know, we could, we could do... (talking into the telephone) Hallo. Yes ? Where are you ? LARRY (voice over) Is everything okay ? Really ? No, I could, sure.  I could. Yeah. I need-I need, you know, five minutes, or so. Okay. Yes. Yes. I know where it is. Okay, hold on.  I can't do it. I have to... My wife, I have a little thing I have to do. I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week, or something.  What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment ? Are you nuts ?  A fuddy-dud ?  What are you talking about ? That's a crime. You can't do that. You... That's-That's burglary and breaking and entering. But... What has gotten into you lately ? For crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause.  Hey, look. Do... I don't want to... You-You'll wind up rooming with John Gotti. You can't do that. You can't just steal the key and then go into somebody's apartment.  I don't wanna know. I don't wanna be an accessory.  Tell Ted. I don't want to know. Leave me alone. CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) I told Ted. LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain) You told Ted before you told me ? CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) Yeah. He's more open-minded about these things. LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain) Yes, I know. I'm-I'm-I'm a bore. I'm-Because I-Because I don't break the law, you know ? CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) Yeah. LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain) I live within the Constitution, so I'm dull. CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) Listen. Perhaps he got rid of the urn, okay ?  I-I don't wanna hear. Leave me alone. Don't tell me.  How do you know ?  He did ?  You hid under his bed ?  I cannot believe this. My stomach is curdling, here I...  But what would you have done if he, if he found you out ?  That far ahead ? You're talking two seconds.  He could have looked under the bed and there you are. What do you...  I don't wanna know. Leave me alone.  Yeah, yeah. I... I know, I get it, his name is Paul, but I don't care. I don't wanna hear.  I just don't...  What ?  Well, thank you.  And you can divide it up and we can all have some.  You'll really like this dessert.  Okay, I'll get some plates for it. Wait a minute.  Yeah, that's great.  No, I'm fine. I'll be right in. CAROL (voice over) Um... Okay, great. LARRY (to Paul, with a louder voice) Are you okay ? Can-can-can-can we do anything for you ? PAUL (voice over from the kitchen) Coffee or tea ?  You know, I found your glasses.  These are yours, aren't they ?  No.  No, no, those aren't yours. These are the same, actually. They are, aren't they ? These-These-These ones, are.  Did you ? I didn't notice that.  At your mother's house.  That mousse looks fabulous.  Thank you very much.  Very much. Very much.  That's funny. I found those glasses under my bed.  Kicked under, right, because what she'll do, she'll drop...  She'll always drop things and she'll kick them all around the house.  The mousse ?  She's always-She's always kick...  Yes, really ? Remember there was the time you kicked the mousse under the bed in the house. Remember that ? It was...  It took-took six months to get the...  There's her house.  Yeah.  Maybe he thought that if he, if he, if he divorced her, she'd-she'd hit him for a ton of alimony. Or maybe she, maybe she controls the family fortune. What do you think of that ?  Does yours ? I'll tell you, mine needs something.  You want ? They're jelly doughnuts. You want a jelly doughnut ? CAROL (with a disgusted tone in her voice) Ooh.  Eh ? Come on. No, come on. Come on. You gotta get into it.  Oh my God. Look, look, look, look, look ! CAROL (voice over) What ? What ? What ? What ? TED (yelling in voice over) Helen ! Helen ! (Back to a normal low voice) Duck, duck, duck ! CAROL (voice over) Ted! God, oh...Oh. TED (yelling in voice over) Helen !  It's not her.  No, it's not her.  What...  I figured she'd come out and go to work, you know ?  I'm writing a play about something that happened to you and me.  Remember-Remember that time... you and... you and I and Larry and Julie were all on that-that eating tour of France ?  And they, and then they wandered off and they forgot to pick us up ? You remember ? We had to share that bed-and- breakfast place.  Yeah.  Yeah, but not a bed. CAROL (voice over) No, not a... Well, God. You were too gentlemanly to suggest that.  Well, it's not... Not that I didn't think of it.  It could have been our little secret, then you passed out.  Not that long ago.  Look, look, look, look.  Isn't it ?  Beautiful, huh ? Look around.  Huh ? Well, it used to be all mirrors, and it was quite beautiful. PAUL (voice over) I'm having all this broken glass replaced as we go along with this renovation. You know, they used to have stage shows, here. Now, of course, we only show old movies.  That's because I'm the only one here. And my assistant, Mrs. Dalton. I'm gonna have this place fixed up, then I'm gonna sell it. The money's gonna come in handy.  What's that noise ?  What's the matter ? CAROL (voice over) Larry, come with me, okay ?  Oh, Geez, I was... CAROL (voice over) Come on.  I was fast asleep. I was dreaming of round card girls.  Oh, Christ. Not that again. Please, you know...  What are you talking about ? Where're you going ?  It's-It's one o'clock in the morn...  What ? What ?  What-What're you doing ? You got his key ?  You're kidding. What are you talking about ? You can't do... Why... because you-you followed him to the movie house, you-you said there was nothing happening.  Well, so what ? That's the...  What... Hey, listen to me. Come here.  Come here. Wait a minute. Come here. Look, look.  I've been thinking about you.  I think you gotta see... I gotta... You gotta, you gotta go back to your shrink.  I want you to see Doctor Ballard again.  I'm s... Yeah. I know. But you...  You know how General Motors will recall defective cars ? Well, you gotta go in for a tune-up.  You got... No. No.  I... What... I'm telling you, I'm your husband. I command you to sleep !  Sleep ! I command it !  I command it ! Sleep !  Uh, yes. The country house. The bluebird. I know.  But that, though, was a sweet mystery. This is murder.  No, I... Yeah, look, no, I-I forbid you ! I forbid you to go! It's a-a... I'm forbidding ! Is that what you do when I forbid you ? If-If that's what you... I'm not going to be forbidding you a lot, if you do...  Don't do this. We should be asleep, now, in one of our many cuddling positions.  This is wrong.  This is no good. I promise you, this could only lead to great unhappiness.  Pl... I can't relax. How can I relax ? I'm in a strange man's apartment in my, in my T-shirt and-and pajamas.  What do you mean, Ted told you ? Who... Ted ? Ted ? What is he, your mentor ?  Ted is a sick schmuck. He's-He's home, and we're in...  I mean, I'm... What if he comes back ? I'm... My heart is....  Hang the phone up.  Hang the phone up, now.  Good, good.  Let's get out. I wanna go home. I want to go back to bed.  Run a check on it ? What, do you want to beat it down to the morgue ? You got all the jargon.  Where are you going ?  I'm not a night person. I don't wanna be... What are you... I don't know what I'm looking for.  What ? What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail ? This is insane.  Oh, my...  Jesus. Oh, Christ !  What do you mean, clean it up ? What am I gonna do, vacuum ?  I can't. It's a wall-to-wall carpet. I broke his-his-his- his... porcelain...  What do you mean, glue it ? What are you talking about ?  What ?  So what ? Gloves. I have gloves. They keep my fingers warm.  Let's get out of here, because this is a...  It's eye of the beholder. What you have... you've got to go to the eye doctor, get happy glasses.  Look, I'm gonna take the pieces with us, and we'll-we'll get rid of them.  I loved it, I...  I loved... But then again, I love chocolate anything, so...  Right.  Well, I...  If only he could stay in town-If only could stay in town just a couple of more hours.  I know. I was going to, but I...  They're working us so hard at school. I can't.  I gotta get right back.  I'm gonna take him to Brooks Brothers for his present. And- And-And, uh...  Brooks Brothers. Yeah.  Your mother's going to a wine-tasting.  Yeah. A sweater.  She's going to a wine-tasting. Can you believe that ?  Hi. Hey, I want you to meet somebody.  I want you to meet somebody. This is, this is...  Hi. How are you ?  This is my wife.  You snuck around.  Yeah. This is Marcia Fox.  My son Nick. He's in town on, uh...  It's his birthday, so we took him to Twenty-One.  Nick. How are you doing ?  It's a tradition we have in the family.  Oh, I fixed her up with Ted. He's going to take her...  Yeah. That place that we ate at.  He's a lot of fun. You'll have a very good time.  That's great. So.  Oh, it's great. She'll have a great time.  S-So, what are you making a face for ? She's great.  Ted's type ?  She's anybody's type. She's brilliant, she's talented. Yeah. I gave you...  You get your bag.  No, she's dangerously sexual.  Let me tell you... Listen, when you go to the wine-tasting, honey...  Getting back to real life, spit it out. Okay ? When you drink...  Yeah. Don't drink too much, Mom.  Yeah, spit... And spit it out.  They spit it out at a wine-tasting, you know what I mean ? Because, yeah. I don't want you to be lying on the bathroom floor with your head by the bowl tonight, you know ?  I love the blue in that.  Yeah, yeah, well, you know. He's...  He says she's wonderful, and I'm...  I'm trying to do everything I can to get out and meet people, you know.  I'm-I'm not looking forward to this.  Yeah.  I-I guess. She's not my first choice.  Yeah, it's great. Of course, I can't have my first choice.  I'm getting drunk. I don't know what I'm saying.  I'm gonna be late for my shrink. I've got a...  Yeah.  Well, you know, you would be my first choice.  Yeah.  Well, you... Can I give you a lift ? Do you, uh, I'm gonna go east. Do you...  I didn't offend you by what I said, did I ?  See you later.  Sorry. Excuse me.  I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers' today for Nick, today. LARRY (voice over) Really beautiful. It's cashmere. Very expensive. The kid looked so handsome in it, though. Also, I decided I'd cook dinner tonight. My one dish tuna casserole.  What ? CAROL (voice over) Mrs. House.  Oh, Jesus. You're not about Mrs. House again. I thought we'd have a light dinner, you know, because we had a rich lunch at Twenty-One, I thought.  Uh, the dead woman passed you on a bus ? Which bus was this, the bus to heaven ?  Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You want to lie down for a while ? We'll put a cold compress on your head, or a hot compress on your back, or...  Remember I said to you ? Yes, remember I said to you, spit it out ?  I said don't drink it. You said you were going to a wine- tasting ?  You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon ? I said spit it out ?  I said don't swallow it ? You swallowed it. And that's why you're this way.  Yeah, I 'm sure you saw her.  How could you see her ? She's dead. Not only is she dead, she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween.  I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City transit system.  What's going on ?  Let me put it this way : total psychotic breakdown. Okay ? Is that enough ?  Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now forget this.  Taste my tuna casserole. Tell me if I put in too much hot fudge.  Oh, Ted. Ted.  She wasn't murdered. It was a coronary. It was a coronary, folks. It was a coronary. She wasn't murdered. I don't know what they're talking about.  He was at the wine tasting, too. Sure, why not.  They're both at the wine tasting.  Don't run a check. Don't run a check.  Stop.  Listen, could you call back later, because my marriage is falling apart.  Forget it. Will you ? If you're gonna have an affair with the guy, you don't need a murder to do it.  Yes, I know, on the bus, the dead persons' bus. No car fare.  Now, sit down. Let's...  Yeah, I'm not going to see the exact spot.  No, I've got a business lunch tomorrow. I got...  No, I got a business lunch. I'm not interested.  Hm ? I'm not interested. Come on, will you...  Will you eat something ? We've got tickets to the theatre.  Tell them your story. Tell them this whole cockamamie story.  That's right. That's right, you've got nothing.  Yeah, okay, good. Now, will you sit down because we're going to the theater. I don't care what you say.  Oh, Jack ? Jack ? You-you were there when Mrs. House died, right? You saw her ?  Yes, she was lying on the floor.  Hey, he said it was lying on the floor. Right. Right. You know, I... He's sure. He's sure. He's sure.  She was in that bag. Yeah.  My-My-My wife's been having some bad dreams, and she doesn't know what she's talking about.  Yeah, this is, this is for all the times I call you to fix the faucet, and you show up six months late.  Thanks.  Yeah, but...  If she's a twin, it's a different story. But you don't seem to feel she is, so...  Who's in on it ? The super ? The super can't change a fuse.  What ?  She's not alive, unless she's a twin. Okay ? Now keep quiet...  Shut up.  Lillian House.  Uh, maiden name, Lillian Beagle. Born in Carlyle, Pennsylvania, nineteen-thirty-five. Married Paul Richard House.  She was not a twin. Had an older sister who...  Uh, went to England twenty years ago, and an older brother who died in nineteen-eighty-seven.  This is where we were. CAROL (voice over) This is where we were. I know. And I was sitting right here, after you left.  Right.  You saw her after I left ?  Wait a minute. Are you... You're absolutely sure you saw her ? You saw her face ?  What was the number of the bus ?  All right. Okay, look, look. It's a cross-town bus.  Okay, so look. The end of the line is a few blocks down there.  So, she... She had to get off somewhere... somewhere.  Yeah, right. So, let's, let's look around. Let's, we, we'll see some, you know, uh, like a, like a, you know... clue, or something. Or something. Maybe we'll see her. You're sure you saw her face ?  Okay, okay, okay. No, no, no, no.  I think this is it.  I don't think... there's noth... Watch out. Watch out.  Yeah, look. See ? See, he's turning. That's it.  That's all there is, here.  What ?  You-you wear a tie with a dress. It's a... It's a very special...  Oh, it'd look great on you. No, no, just don't wear it with pants.  With pants, it's-it's... what ?  At what ? What ? CAROL (voice over) That hotel. TED (voice over) What about it? CAROL (voice over) Well, that's... the Waldron. I mean, I thou... I-I was in his apartment, I pressed the number... «last number dialed», and... TED (voice over) You're kidding. CAROL (voice over) And they answered the phone. And said... Waldron. TED (voice over) Let's-Let's-Let's get to a phone. Let's get to a phone. Let's call up. You got a quarter ?  Hallo ? Mrs. House, please ? Mrs... Mrs. House. Can you ring her room for me, please ?  Really ?  What. Maybe... Well, maybe she checked out. No-nobody, nobody at all. Uh... What about...?  Yeah, what about, uh, Helen Moss, Moss. You're sure ? Nobody... nobody at all. All-All right. All right, okay. I'm sorry. All right. Thank you. thank you.  So...  I-I never go out. I-I-I-I-I just, I can't take... I can't...  No, no, no. I'm just probably just a little drunk.  No. What are you talking about ? I had rum cake.  Uh, one second. Just let me, let me see, see what I, possibilities I got here. Uh, yeah. I'm gonna have, uh... I'll have, uh... I'm gonna have four cards.  Yeah.  Inside and outside straight.  You know, I can't escape the feeling that my-my wife is becoming attracted to somebody else... and it's really bothering me.  Yeah. That's why I'm not playing my best. This guy is, you know, more adventurous than I am, and for some reason they just seem to hit it off. I'm gonna be very lonely if, uh, you know, if this happens.  Yeah, I do. I do.  Uh, Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with.  Yeah.  Maybe-Maybe I should actually make a greater effort with- with Carol.  Well, it's more fun than the Wagner opera.  Would you rather be here with Ted ?  More enthused ?  Well, he's a fun guy. He's a light guy, I'm a heavy guy.  You know, Ted-Ted would be fun on a scavenger hunt.  You know, he's the guy you want if you have a really heavy scavenger hunt. He's the man.  Do you know that this neighborhood was where I first took you out on a date when we-we first started going out.  Hey, you remember there was a movie house right on this corner.  Not to change the subject.  I took you to see «Last year at Marienbad» on our first date ?  Who knew they were flashbacks ? You know.  Are you gonna burst into a song, here ? We're in a car.  Let me ask you a personal question, here.  Did you ever sleep with Ted ?  Don't get nervous. Yeah. Yeah, you guys...  We were on an eating tour of France, together.  You two guys spent an evening, you know, together.  At that place, you know.  That meant absolutely nothing. She hated me. Julie despised me.  You know that. She-She thought I was a low-life and a wimp and a vermin and a roach. Just-Just jump in anytime you want to defend me, you know.  Ho-ho ! Hey, you're nailing me... Jesus !...  Yeah. CAROL (voice over) Larry, Larry, look. It's her ! I'd say it's her ! LARRY (voice over) Oh my god, it is. CAROL (voice over) Yeah. You see what I mean ? See, so I was right all along, wasn't I ? LARRY (voice over) Can you... Are you sure ? Are you sure ? CAROL (voice over) I'm positive. Yes. LARRY (voice over) Oh, my God. CAROL (voice over) Right ? Right ? I mean, I was...  I'm... Jesus, I'm sh...  That is her. Are you...  Oh, don't give me Ted ! Wh... Let's... Let's... Wh... Let's get out of here.  What ?  What ?  How ? How ?  And came in with a-with a canvas bag, and an umbrella.  Mrs. Caine ?  Mrs. Caine. Uh-huh.  We-We had a present for her. We're friends. We-We wanted to surprise her, because it's her birthday, so-so...  Yeah, we-we may need some information, while we're here, so-so, we just want you to know... I'll take very good care of you, if you play ball with us.  What are you making that face for ? He's the father of our country. CAROL (voice over) Will you come on ?  I'm coming, I'm coming.  Huh. Very nice. I love a hotel that's got lots of blue powder sprinkled along the baseboard.  Mrs. House ?  I don't... I don't...  I don't think she's... CAROL (voice over) I don't see her. LARRY (voice over) This may not be the right-right place. CAROL (voice over) Just hold on, Larry. Hold on, hold on, hold on.  There's nothing here.  What's the matter ?  Oh, Jesus.  What's the matter ?  What-What-What...  What? What-What's...  Dead ? T-T-Try-Try giving her the present.  Oh, come on ! Let's get out of here !  Come on. Let's get out of here.  I'm thinking of running the Boston marathon.  This woman is forever dying.  Come on, come on. Move, move. Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears.  Get down those stairs.  Come on, come on. Quickly.  What do you mean, there's nobody up...  We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor.  She was totally dead.  Wait, wait.  The... Y-Yes. She was... It looked like she was strangled, or something. Not-Not that I'm an expert on violent death, because I wouldn't know.  Right, I'm a... I-I work at Harper's.  I'm in publishing.  Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the restaurant, myself, but-but she's a wonderful cook.  Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body. Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were here fast. It took-took you three minutes, not-not-not counting the half-hour that the operator 911 took to understand what I was saying.  Any witnesses ?  Jesus, I gotta have a drink. I gotta calm myself. I need fourteen Zanacks or something.  Ted ? Ted-Ted's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight. He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly.  Helen ? I don't know and...  I don't want to know about this. I think we should change our lives.  We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know. You know, start over maybe in Mexico.  You know, sell blankets. We'll work off the hood of a car or something.  I'm telling you, I didn't know what's happening. It was like one of those television shows, where you open the door, and you see a-a dead body. You know, I always hated those shows.  I... The only one I ever saw was my uncle Morris, who was ninety-four years old.  He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereals.  This is too exciting. I don't need this. You know, I like something quiet... like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th avenue. You know, I don't need a murder to enliven my life at all.  Make sure and tell me that just before I go to sleep, tonight. That'll be good for me.  Great, I'll never get my eyes closed. You know, I mean, what do you want me to do ? I'm petrified. Not only that, but I'm a little drunk.  Well, it was... Well... You know, obviously, it wasn't Mr. House, because he has an alibi.  She doesn't buy that. She doesn't buy the alibi. Let's get out of here. I want to go home.  Jesus, it's starting to rain again. Can you believe that ?  Yeah, I know. I know. Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve.  You know what I think ? I think it's possible. That hotel room was on the, on the ext... That end of the hall. CAROL (voice over) What ? Yeah ? LARRY (voice over) It's right up there. That's the room. CAROL (voice over) I know. LARRY (voice over) Well, what if they got the body out over that little roof ? You know, that would be a possibility. Why would... CAROL (voice over) Ohhh !... What are the lights... LARRY (voice over) Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, that's eerie, isn't it ?  Yeah, well, let's call the police.  Check it out ?  What, are you nuts ? No, I'm not gonna check that out.  Yeah, I know, I know. That's crazy. Look, look. Why don't we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can check it out while we're home in the... ?  What do you mean, it's your case ?  Hey, come here. I don't want to do this.  No.  Hey, don't give me Ted. Ted would be shaking in his boots.  I'm at least just trembling like a leaf.  My what ?  Yeah, I-I...  No, no, no, no, no. I-m-I'm-I'm-I'm j... I'm-I'm ju... um... I'm a detective. They-They-They lowered the height requirements, so I... I'll take this card back. They-re, they're...  ...expensive.  Be careful.  I'm not upsetting anything. I just, you know, I'm just gonna leave a-a set of fingerprints around, so if there's a trial, we can get trapped.  I don't like this.  Let's go. You know, I've got to get up early tomorrow. I've got to be in temple.  Shhh !...  Ahhh !... Oh, Jesus! What...  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... Didn't mea... I-I, oh, it's- It's-It's a...  You don't have to turn the bed out. It's not necessary. And no-no-no croissants tomorrow for breakfast.  Here, here. Here, take this for yourself. I like the towels. Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh...  Let's go. That's why the light was on. This is crazy, we're gonna get in trouble.  Oh, look. I did damage. I... Now. I'll be sued. CAROL (voice over) Oh ! Larry !  That's what ?  How do you know ?  You did ?  Jesus.  So much for the police combing every inch of this place. Where did you find it ?  Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open.  I don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff.  We should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know what I mean ? This goes... this could be... Who knows who's involved in this ? This could go very deep, Carol. This could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission, or something. I don't like it.  Jesus ! What is that ?  Why are we stopping ? Why are we stopping ?  Don't tell me to relax ! I'm-I'm-I'm a-a world-renowned claustrophobic.  Stop. Hit something.  I don't like this, I don't, I don't...  It's easy for you to say, but I can't breathe, I'm phobic.  I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm...  I'm just going to say the rosary, now.  Oh, I don't know, I don't like this.  Say something. Stop it.  I don't like this.  I'm running over a field, I see open meadows. I see a stallion.  I'm a stallion.  There's-There's a cool breeze passing over me.  I see grass. I see dirt.  You know, you said, you said, «Act as a policeman».  I said «No». You said «Pretend to be a policeman». You said «Show him your card». I said «What card».  You know, I ca...  I can't get through those things.  It'll never open, they're painted shut.  They're-They're... They-They never, they... they never open.  I'm breathing.  I can't breathe. I can't breathe.  I can't breathe. I can't breathe.  I'm fainting because the-there's...  Oh, Jesus !  Oh, Jesus, you've got to cut down on those rich desserts.  Let's go, my life is passing in front of my eyes. The worst part of it is, I'm driving a used car.  I'm scared.  Oh, my God. It's her.  Oh, Jesus. Claustrophobia and a dead body. This is a neurotic's jackpot.  We're going down.  We're going down.  Press up ? I can't see my hand. How can I press up ? Jesus.  The basement. I want to get off in the mezzanine. I'm returning shoes. It's dark in here.  Where are you... I'm getting back on the elevator. I don't care.  I-I can't see anything.  Th-Th-These are my matches. I got them at...  Look. I got... Yeah, I was with an author. An authoress. At-at the... At...  Yeah, b... A French, a French authoress. An author.  Jesus.  I like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table. You know, where you can...  What ? What ?  I... No, wait a minute. Not so fast. I don't like it here, it's dank.  And there's strange noises. I don't know what this is. I don't know. This...  Oh, Jesus !  Calm down ? Don't tell me to calm down.  This... Wh-Wh... I-I don't... What do you...  Oh, relax, relax, relax. Don't... I'll break it down. Stand back.  Don't worry. Just-Just give me a second.  Must be one of those new doors.  Oh, my god. I keep hearing noises.  Where ? Where you... Where are you going ? Don't leave me.  Well, come on.  Come on, get it open.  Go into a trot.  What ?  Jesus.  Yes.  It is. Oh, brother. LARRY (voice over) Let's-Let's-Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. CAROL (voice over) Oh, my God. Wait. No, look ! Let's-Let's follow him. Come on. LARRY (voice over) No, no, no, no. CAROL (voice over) Yeah, no. Come on.  I'm not going to follow. I'm not gonna... I don't wanna follow him.  I know, I saw that there was a...  I don't wanna follow a car with a body in it.  It's-It's probably-It's probably a rented car.  And a rented body.  Come on ! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped.  That was Mr. House ! That was definitely Mr. House.  I'm gonna call the Police, now.  And get them...  What are we...  Ohhh !...  Hallo, there.  How are you ?  May I introduce Gladys Dalton, my gal Friday ?  This is Larry and Carol, my neighbors.  We were just watching Madame Bovary. Wonderful.  She-She-She gets cremated. She gets killed at the end.  Yeah. Listen you gotta stop up for a drink before I go on my trip.  See you later.  Oh, incidentally, if you hear of anybody who needs an apartment, I think I may be moving.  See you later. Come on, Gladys.  Good night.  Oh, Jesus. What a day, huh ? I can't figure it out. It's got to be that either he's a...  Either she's a twin, or he's a twin.  Or they're multiple personalities, or you're a twin or I'm a twin.  Because I don't know what's going on.  You know, look.  Let me be logical about this.  Hey.  Stay calm. I want to try and puzzle this out.  Yeah, I'm going to be logical.  The, um, the first thing is this.  But you-you remember that you heard a noise that night. That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel.  I can't sleep. I just, I...  I'm too, you know... I'm too...  Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey... and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something to eat, and talk with them.  Yeah, so what ? So what ? It's so, you know, Ted-Ted was taking her to a show and to-to-to dinner... so they'll be there.  So, hey, kid, this is the apple. This is the town that never sleeps. That's why we don't live in Duluth. That, plus I don't know where Duluth is.  Lucky me.  Uh, you really saw his face ?  You saw, you saw what he looked like ? No question. You know exactly who it is.  Oh, no question about it. It was-It was Mr. House. There was no... Not a, not a question. I mean, you could see him because, uh, you know, there was-there was just no way that you could avoid it. He was right there.  Wh... How do you see it ?  How obvious ? What do you mean ?  What do you mean ?  What ? How ? What do you mean ?  Yeah.  That's what I said. That's exac... I used the term «ballpark resemblance» myself.  It was my idea. I said what she said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you think, you think Helen Moss is in on this, too, huh ?  That's right, because he introduced her as a colleague.  Wait, why... Why would she...  Oh, wait, wait. He's cheating on her, too.  Cheating on two women ?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's perfect. Just, it all fits.  The guy doesn't look the part.  Oh, my... Oh, where did you find this woman ? She's a genius.  She's brilliant. She's brilliant. But the guy... He knows that we know, so if he knows we're on him.  She's right, there's no body.  Yeah, but it's a great theory. Have you been paying attention ? This is a great theory.  Oh, yeah. It sounds good, it holds water. Everything fits together in this.  I think it's great.  Oh, excuse me.  Where-Where did you find her ? She's-She's-She's really something.  Her mind, it just goes.  Yeah, she's got one idea after another. It's like one thing leads to another.  Fantastic.  Oh, I thought we just had a nice first date. That's... LARRY (voice over) I knew that they would hit it off.  What are you talking about ?  I'm, I'm, huh, what's wrong with you ? I'm her editor. I'm- I'm a father figure to her, how...  You gotta be joking. What... are you telling me that you're jealous of Marcia ?  Kids, kids. People, what are we doing, here?  What'd wrong with you ? You're jealous because he's-he's interested in her.  I'm interested in her theory. What... I don't... What are you...  What... What do you mean ? What do we... We pretend that he slipped up, and the molten steel didn't do the job ? What- What do you mean ?  You're kidding. I... We couldn't have gotten her out of that. We... I would have wound up with a few toes and a shoulder, maybe, at most.  I like this woman, she's lurid.  Yeah, first of all, because I can't, I can't bluff or lie without giggling, so-so...  I mean, so-so maybe they, you know, they put him in jail. What have you got ? You haven't got anything. LARRY (voice over) Right.  But if he wants the evidence, and he's got to pay for it, now... Okay, now he's nervous, right ?  Yeah, but where are you gonna get it. Madame Tussaud's ?  Why-Why would she do that ? MARCIA (to Larry) Remember that book you recommended to me ? «Murder in Manhattan» ?  Oh, yes. Max Schindler's book. That's right, the phone call. CAROL (voice over) I don't remember that book.  This is perfect. CAROL (voice over) You never mentioned that book to me.  No, no. Because you don't like light reading, so I never...  I don't know... I don't know this book. What is this book ?  This book. That's fantastic ! It would be so perfect because s-she's a, she's a-an, actress, or would-be actress, anyhow, and you're-you-re... Jeez, we could use his theatre. He's a playwright. This is so perfect. Your theatre is empty all the time, anyhow.  Oh, yeah, thank you. That's great. What-What are we talking about here ? What-What do you mean ? What-What is this ?  Listen to this. What you do is, we get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything. TED (voice over) Yeah.  And she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing and we tape-record it. CAROL (voice over) Uh...  Listen to this. CAROL (voice over) I'm listening.  And we edit it up. We edit the tape recording up, and we make one end of a phone call... LARRY (voice over) ...and we play it into the phone to Mr. House.  This is in the book ?  This is perfect, list... CAROL (voice over) Oh, come on. No, that could never, ever work, in a million years. You don't know what he's going to say.  It's coordinated.  Actually, in the book what happens is, now that I think of it, he... he kills the... the two people that are working the scheme on him. TED (voice over) Yeah, that's all right. CAROL (voice over) But... TED (voice over) But you're not worried about that.  Um, well, I don't know.  Either that, or I've... I've just developed Parkinson's.  No, we can handle him. We can handle him. Listen, this is incredible. This is an incredible idea.  That's great. It's great. You're wonderful. I just... I'm amazed.  This is great.  No, no, no, no, no, I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm just turning it over in my mind. I just want to check with my clergyman before we commit.  Good, that's great. Thank you, Suzanne. Thank you.  Yeah. Good, thank you.  This is Helen Moss.  Uh, have you, uh... I know, I know you just got the material, uh, you know, just in the... last little while, but... uh, h-have you had a chance to-to study it ? To go over it, a little bit ?  Sure , yeah.  Uh, yes. Yes.  Yes. Yeah. But she's, uh, very, highly emotional.  You know really... uh, lot of... Lot of feeling. Very strong.  Hm ?  Yeah, just... Whenever, you know, whenever you feel it. Whenever you feel into it.  I'm trying, I'm trying.  It's so...  That's great.  Where ?  Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'll-I'll just keep improvising, you know ?  You know what ? I'll g... I'll talk about the play, or, get her, get her talking about the part, you know, her life. I'll get her talking about her life, and her whole background. Stop the car, I'm gonna get out here.  All right. Good - Good luck with your assignment. Ok ?  Would you stop with the guacamole ? We have to get started with this.  He should be back for lunch, right ?  Come on, let's go.  So, everybody's got the right tape recorder and the right tape in ?  Yes, we do.  All right, one second. And then we ca... I mea... so, uh, we're on speaker.  Now wait, wait, wait. There's, um... I'm not nervous.  I have the contractor come in and nobody's here ? Now you see if you can find...  I'll get that. Uh, you go and call him.  Hallo ?  What's the problem ?  Say that again.  Exactly who has it ? How many are there ?  Where are you calling from ? There's an echo. Are you on a speaker phone ?  We don't have an answer for that. What are we gonna do ?  Shhh !...  Look, we can't talk about this on the phone. Can you meet me ?  Two... what ? Two hours what ?  Jesus... we're all screwed up. I got this all screwed up.  All right, well, do something. Do something. MARCIA (to Larry) Shhh !... Um, okay. Sh !...  Look, Helen, you're not making any sense. I know you're upset, but you have to pull yourself together. Now, could we meet ? The usual spot.  Helen ? Helen, you still there ? Helen ?  Somebody press something, come on.  You can't press some... Come on.  No, no. It's nothing.  I'm fine, I'm fine.  I said I was fine. Will you stop interfering ?  What's the matter ? What are you so angry about ? What are you so... What are you so steamed up about ?  What are you talking about ?  We had just a big success in there.  Marcia likes to read what I like to read.  You got stuff in common with Ted, right ? You can cook together with Ted, or you can take your clothes off and baste a chicken with him.  Mud wrestling. Is that what you want to hear ? Nothing, I'm her editor.  I reevaluated our lives.  I... I... I got a ten. You got a six.  Oh. You don't have to see your shrink. There's nothing wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and a polo mallet.  What are you talk...  Oh, yeah ?  So, your father is wanted in three states for driving ? Really ?  Oh, how wonderful.  Was that before or after the fourth abortion ?  The drama prize ?  I don't remember the...  What ?  Oh, yeah. Oh, for the fraternity party, yeah, yeah.  Topless «Macbeth». I don't... How could I forget that ? It's just...  Hallo, Mr. House ? This is Larry Lipton. I... I got a... a package I think you're gonna want. Of course it's gonna cost you, uh, $200,000 in... in small, unmarked bills. Or... or... or large marked ones, if... if... if you want to go that route.  And I have a package you might want, Mr. Lipton. If you ever wanna see your wife alive again, you'll do as I say.  Oh, really ? Well, I think you're bluffing. Yeah, don't... don't ever try and bluff a bluffer. Yeah, if... if you got Carol, put her on the phone.  Oh, my... Oh, my God. D... Don't hurt her !  I'll tell you exactly where to meet me, and you bring that package I want. Now, once I have it and I'm safely gone, you'll get your wife back. Otherwise, I'll kill her.  Yes, yes. Yeah, no, no, no, no. I... I... I understand. I, uh, yes, no. I'll be there. I'll be there. I... I... Yes, I'll b... I... I'll bring your wife's body, she... In... in... in the trunk of my car. Yes, I'll... I... I promise. I'll be there. I...  I don't have his wife's body. Bluff, bluff.  Where's Carol ?  First show me Lillian's body.  I... I got it.  There's no way she could have survived that vat of molten steel.  No, no, I... I... I got...  If you're not bluffing, where is she ?  Why are you so nervous ? What are you so nervous about ?  Where ?  If I don't have her, what are you so nervous ?  Where is she ?  I got her in the trunk of my car.  Open it. Come on, now.  I... I got her.  If she's not there, I'll put a bullet through your head. Now, open it !  I... I...  Come on! Come on!  Step back!  No, no, I got her. See, if I don't have her, how come I got her ring ? I got her ring, there. This is... This is her ring.  I think you're lying !  It's a... No, no, no, no. Uh.  What is this ? What is this ?  I could never bluff.  What ?  I... I... I've lost a fortune in cards over the years.  Listen to me.  I'm not a bluffer.  I'm going to put a... Get a...  They can't see us behind the screen, and they can't hear us with the sound on. Not even a gunshot. ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) I knew I'd find you two together.  Mrs. Dalton.  None of you can prove anything. ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) So you'd be foolish to fire that gun. ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell. You are aiming at me, aren't you ?  Carol ? Carol ? Carol ?  God ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ?  Jesus, I was, I was never so glad to see somebody in my life. Are you all right ?  You don't know what's going on out there. I'll never say that life doesn't imitate art again. I'm... I'm... Oh, gee...  Yes, and... and... and... a glazier.  Quick, quick. Dial, dial, dial.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, wife mine.  Wife mine.  God, it's... it's so complicated. I can't... Can't keep track of it all.  He had some great alibis.  Yeah.  What do you... What do you... I want, I want to celebrate, or something. What do you wanna do ? You wanna... Wanna go see what, uh, what Larry and Carol are up to ?  Oh, yeah. Uh, okay. All right. Uh, well, you have any plans ?  Yeah, right. Absolutely. Only we can't sleep together.  Not... not tonight.  Well, I already slept with Helen Moss once today, and I'm not young and active like I used to be.  What an experience.  I'm... I'm still vibrating.  Incredible.  What do you mean surprisingly ?  You seem shocked.  You know, I'm a pretty good guy, you know.  Where do you wanna go for dinner tonight ? Let's not go to any restaurant where they serve cowards.  I... What are you laughing at ?  How could you have ever been jealous of Marcia ? Isn't that ridiculous ? Don't you know that I could only love you ?  Ted ?  You've got to be kidding. Take away his-his-his elevator shoes and his fake suntan and his capped teeth... and what do you have ?  Right. I love that.
