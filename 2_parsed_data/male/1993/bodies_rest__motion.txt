We're moving. We're going to move. Two days. Yeah. I haven't known for long. I just  decided. What do I need that makes me make  these decisions? Beth?... Whatever makes me happy. That's what  she says... I know this place. I know what happens here. I know what's going to happen. The same job, same scenery, same  people... I've been in this town for  years... Years!! Oh, Carol... Forever -- it seems forever. Fourteen hours. In a car? It's a fuckin' nightmare. And there's no radio in Utah. It's  all religious programs. No thanks. Too much money. The show. The meal.  The slots. Then the hotel -- that's  another hundred down the toilet. Hi, honey. Pizza Hut, tomorrow? What's your problem? Okay. You agreed to try Billings. Yeah and I read that a while ago --  so the future's probably already  there. It's not like you're leaving anything  behind. A good job or something. You'll make new friends. Then what is it? That was years ago. That's right. And we're moving. She won't be your  best friend anymore. Living with someone isn't such a big  deal. Anyway... I live with you now. Beth!... Beth!! It's... it's raining! Since we got it? Shit. What's wrong with it? Shit. I hate this shit! It never kept the  coffee hot. And now this. No. It doesn't. Water comes out. I could've gotten a new one. On my  discount. Now it's too late. No. I want an appliance that works. This coffee maker was junk. This blender's junk. Our t.v. is  junk! I don't know why we're even bothering  to pack. The t.v. gets no channels. I can't believe we don't have a big  t.v. But at our age... I'm not hungry. Take a t.v.? Like a bonus. I might do it. Maybe they are. Maybe when I get my check today,  there'll be a bonus in it. Yeah... Yeah... That's true. And I sold a lot of teevees for  them... I should go. Don't wanna be late on my last day. I gotta go. You livin' in your car or what? Just waiting for the last second to  put on the noose. So Chip -- what's new? Nothing much. I heard you're leaving. Yeah. I'm outta here. They can you? That's what they think. Yeah? I was gonna quit anyway -- this way  I get unemployment. Good deal. Yeah... recession insurance... This way I'm not stuck waiting around  for the lay-offs to start. Lay-offs? The painter. Painting. Well, good morning... Sid. Nice to see you again. Realty office likes a fresh coat  between tenants. I've done this house before. I did a nice job. Tomorrow's Sunday. The new people move in on Sunday. Where are you moving to? Why? I've lived in Enfield my whole life. Could you hold this? I use this to mask. Have you ever  used masking tape to mask? A house like this, it's real easy.  Hardly needs a paint job. It needs a fresh coat... ...a little color. Off-white. No. It's white. It's just dirty. Now if it was my house, I would choose  a color... I would not choose off-white. The color of your eyes. Hazel. What's that? Thanks. A map! I do! I had a map -- I lost it. Here's Billings. Look at this -- right there -- that's  the town I was born in. Where I grew up. Where my parent's  live... Isn't that a coincidence? Oh... no... No... They're not near the interstate. I haven't even called them in years. No. I wouldn't know them. Shit. Thanks. I'm lucky I don't have to kill them. If they were dark, I'd have to put a  layer of kill down first. So the dark paint wouldn't shine  through the off-white. Kill's an oil based paint. It covers the old paint so that you'd  never know it was there, but it gives  off fumes when it's drying. Noxious fumes. They would find us on  the floor unconscious. The "they" that find people... ...unconscious. I guess he'd be the "they". It was the drive that killed us. San  Antonio to Seattle is just too many  hours in a car. If we'd have flown,  we would've made it. Things were all right in bed. Really? Why didn't you go on to Seattle? It  was your car. I'm thinking about stealing a t.v. I'm done in there. I won't paint the  ceiling 'til you've moved the  furniture out. No? I kind of like the sofa. You're not going to take it? Can I have it? Excellent. The painter. About the crime? Nick's gonna steal a t.v. I've never heard that expression. Where's he stealing it from? I'm interested. Crime's interesting.  I read the papers. How? He's got motive. Sid. You lookin' or buyin'? Lookin'. I hate television. Yeah. What do you like? Movies. No... I do. You see... you go to a movie, you're  there. You watch t.v., you're thirteen places  at once. As many channels as you  get, that's as many places as you  are. You get cable? You're forty  places at once. You get a satellite  dish?... You're all over the world. Exactly. You're everywhere. It's called freedom. I also mow lawns. Painting. I'm an inside person. Mowing grass is seasonal. You've got a nice tan. Do you want to get stoned? This kind of painting -- for people  I won't know -- it's boring. It's not very good. It's homegrown. But it'll get you fucked up. It'll take you someplace. Have you thought about American? No. I own an American set. I'm very  satisfied. I want Japanese. I'll tell you... ...the thing is, a hundred and fifty  dollars gets you very little in the  way of Japanese technology. Oh. It would get you that t.v. It's for my parents. Your parents? Yes. They live with me... ...and they want Japanese. Is there a problem? No... I, uh, just never think of  adults as having parents. They do. I know... I'm an adult, I have parents. Oh, Miss, I've got your receipt! This is all you need. Now you just take this receipt out,  give it to the guys at the loading  dock and they'll give you your brand  new beautiful television set. Out back. They'll help load it in  your car and everything. Out back. Think about American. They're mostly  Japanese parts anyway. Miss... I'm helping this customer  here, perhaps you might... You might want to see someone else. Not really. How'd you do it? Excellent. C'mon! You stole it. You gotta see  it! Hold the box. Wait! I thought I heard the police. Me? I'm a little stoned... not that  stoned. No. Carol's really stoned. Very stoned. She doesn't. But she likes getting  stoned. There's nothing like drugs to create  a quick and shallow friendship. Let's look at the loot. Jesus... you didn't fool around. And in Canton, Ohio today, a man  opened fire in a mall, killing nine  and wounding seventeen others. Initial  reports indicate the young man was a  disgruntled employee... Nice speakers! You're moving. Too many distractions. I'll be at it  all night. Not when I'm actually working. I better get set up in the kitchen. That's 'cause you're stoned. It gets the red out. Nobody lives in that, right? Gift shop. But it closed at seven. I got no one to shop for. Shit. Fuckin' wind... Yeah. What does it mean? High pressure field coming in --  should bring some nice weather. No. The wind itself, you know what I  mean, you're an Indian... I'm a Navajo. Yeah, so you're in tune with this  stuff... It's thirteen bucks. Oh... right. Here's a twenty. So what does the wind mean? Like as  an omen or something, you know -- -- a change is coming to the people. --  the spirit of freedom is walking the  land. That kind of meaning... Fourteen, fifteen and five makes  twenty. The wind is. It's the wind like I'm  a Navajo. That's it? Shit. It would be better if meant something. "And he arose and came to his father,  but when he was still a great way  off, his father saw him and had  compassion, and ran and..." Yeah. Travelling has no allure for me. Maybe through time. So I stay here. It's my home. I belong here. My father says if you stay in one  place long enough your luck knows  where to find you. Maybe it is... He's a bartender. He's lived here his whole life. Not yet. But it's probably very close. Are you all right? It seems that way. I found you. We never met before last night... ...but we know each other. Leave it behind. Unhappiness. No. It was true. Come hold me. Come hold me, and you'll be happy. Yes. Yes. No. That's wrong. People tell you that, but it's wrong. I've lived with people who have that  happiness from within. That happiness --  it's just them being pleased with  themselves. It's not enough. It's a  lonely thing. No. I'm not. I'm showing you a way.  You know that. And you know me. And I know you. You know. Is that what you know? That's right. Excuse me... Excuse me... I'm... I'm looking for  my parents. My mother, my father... they... Hello. Oh... good... This is my house. I, uhh... mean  this is the house I grew up in. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Oh. Yelling doesn't help. My name is Nick, Nick Brennan. Did you know the Brennans? They lived here. They used to live  here. I used to live here with them... What's your name? No... I know an Elizabeth. I call her Beth. This is a good sandwich. When did he move here? Would he know  where the people before him went? You're sure? Oh. He can't help me. I've lost my parents. Is that like a joke? Then yes. I lost them both at the  same time. I'm sorry. That's tragic. I should... I'm really sorry. I should go. Attacks... That's very sad... I've really gotta be going. I, uh...  thank you again for the sandwich.  Delicious... Have you found your real parents? Listen... I have to go. I'd like to stay right here... In this moment... Enjoying this  moment. It can go on as long as we want. No. I was married... but it wasn't really  a relationship. Two years. Right out of high school. No. You have beautiful skin... her skin  was polka-dotted. When we were kids we called her  "Spot". She disappeared. No. Not by me... I didn't go look. She wanted to meet someone new. I  asked her "why?" -- she said, "Because  he won't know me from before. Just  now. Just what I am now." I knew her... on playgrounds... in  Sunday School... all those grades --  I knew her as she changed. But she  was still the same person. All the  times I knew her, she was still her. She can't get away from that. You stay in one place, and all those  things that are you... are there.  She didn't understand that if you  leave, they're still there, in you --  but they stop being clear. You stop  knowing who you are, and what you  want. I see the lawns I mow, houses I've  painted, faces I know... my parents...  And I'm constantly reminded of who I  am. I want you. I want to be inside you. No... I want to be able to put myself  inside of you. I love you. Beth? What do you want? Could you give me the number for  information in Arizona?... Thank  you. Enfield. Carol, Carol, umm... Carol... Carol Something... Shit! Hello Janet, thank you for being my  operator. I hope you can help me, I  need to call my home. Well, I'll tell you my number, but  there's a problem. My phone's been  disconnected, not because of bills,  I mean we paid all our bills. We  were hardly ever even late. We were  very good customers, but we're moving,  so we had the phone disconnected.  But now I need to call... the woman  I live with. She's still there and  I've got to let her know where I am. I don't know any of the neighbors. I  know one, but I can't remember her  last name. No. No. No. You see you have to be  able to help me, this is not a prank,  it's my home phone, this is an  emergency. Yes it can, it can be done. Someone  there can hook the phone back up.  It's not like a phone guy came to  our house to disconnect the phone,  nobody came to our house, someone  just flipped a switch somewhere,  somewhere there where you work, or  plugged something into a computer  and our phone stopped working! They turned it off, they can turn it  back on! I know it's the week-end! I know!  Call them at home! They'll have a  computer at their house, they'll  have a phone thing to hook it up to  the real computer! That's how these  people live! They'll be glad to do  it!... No. No. I can't have the police go  to the house. That won't work, there  are circumstances. It's you... you've got to help me!  Please! I've gotta call home! I can't  wait. It could be too late! Janet!!  You've gotta help me! Please! You  can reconnect me. Please!! Don't  hang up! Don't hang up!! You fucker!! You heartless... "If you'd like to make a call, please  hang up and try again. If you need  help..." Morning. Hi. I'm awake. I'm a morning person. Then why don't you come back to bed? Where do we start? Whatever you say. What? He took three years from you. Beth... Phone work? No. I don't think she really wears  jewelry. As a present? No. What about that? That would make her laugh. You got something like it but fake? You're set. Sure. Now I've gotta finish painting, but  Carol here would be happy to help  you unload. And I'll be by tomorrow with my truck  and the big things. Hi. I didn't really need one. When my  friends get drunk, they throw up and  sleep on the floor. You gave me a lot more. ...Feel me? I want you all the time. No... You just feel bad for her like I  feel bad for her... 'cause her husband  died. That's about the saddest thing there  is... losing someone you love. If you died, I couldn't stand life. Go to my house. While you find a place. I can talk to the realtors, I know  they've got a place in Agawam. You can call me when you get there.  I'll give you my number. And today I love you. That doesn't matter. You know that.  It can take a second. Not with me. We're not that way! We're passionate. We're comfortable. It is important! You know that. It didn't "just happen"! You know  we're it! I'm the one for you! No. I'm the last. You've found me.  And it can go on forever. It's not. That's true. You'd want me there. If I wasn't  there it wouldn't matter who was.  You'd be alone. Beth... Beth... you love me... How do you feel? Think! You love me. You have to be with me. That's what makes you an adult? You can say no to me? Beth! Have someplace to go. Why don't... What are you gonna do? Beth! Beth!!! She's not here. Where is she? She's gone. Shit! Excuse me. Shiiiiit!! Who are you? The painter. You're Nick. Yeah. The Indian chief. What? Shit! You're too late. She's gone. I got that. Where'd she go? She didn't say. Shit! She didn't know. Be at Carol's... be at Carol's... I'm too late... This really bothers me! Will you do me a favor? What? Act normal. Listen! I don't want to be normal. I  don't have to be, I don't! This is  my house. You're in my house. And  I'm tired of going to my house and  finding strangers! It's not your house. You're gone.  I'm painting -- -- for the new people -- whose house  it's going to be. You're gone. They're not here yet.  I'm here. I guess that makes this my house. May I look around? Sure. Make yourself at home. Nooo... she left the television. Yeah. Too bad. She didn't seem to want it. That's foolish. That t.v. is a  remarkable thing. Yeah. No. Do you know where she went? Shit. She's gone. Who is this guy? What?! Is this true?! Not really. Not really? Not really?! What? Did you fuck her? I don't tell. Jesus! The next day! That's the world, huh? They don't  even wait a day anymore. I didn't fuck anyone. No... I didn't leave her for another  person, I left her for another place. Which I think is a little more  excusable. I don't. Well it's none of your fuckin'  business! I think it is. Cause you fucked her? No! That gives  you no business in my life. If you hadn't gone, I'd be done by  now. I'd be home. Be glad you have a home, asshole! Why?! I came back... You see -- you don't know everything  about me -- I didn't really have any  real plans! And I brought them together? It seems I'm blessed... in what I  do. I do wrong, and it turns out  right... that I've done right. So it  really doesn't matter what I do. Hey! I said "hey!" I hope you're very happy together! She's gone. She is, isn't she? If you two were such the happy couple  why the fuck did she leave, Romeo? After three years with you, she wanted  to be alone. I was already gone! This is not about  me and Beth, there is no me and Beth!  This is about you! Why didn't you go  with her? It wasn't offered. People aren't going to offer you  anything! You have to take what you  want. You can't take another person. They  have to give themselves to you. That's very wise, but not very true. I sell televisions. People don't  know what they want. You have to  show them. I couldn't show her. Go after her! No. He's not alone, he's with us.  She's alone. She's out there alone. Just hoping she's closer to what she  wants... I don't know! How would I know?! What do I know?! I know that what I want isn't there. It isn't here. It isn't inside! It isn't outside! It doesn't exist. But you want her, and you aren't  doing shit about it! He can go after her. Go after her! I can't. She... My life is here. What kind of man won't fuck up his  life for the women he loves? Go find  her!! She'd she'd she'd... She'd head for her parents! She'd head for her parents. Believe  me. They're in Florida. That's east. I... You start driving east on route forty.  Keep going east and around eleven  start checking every roadside motel.  The budget ones... You do that all  night, you'll find her. When you don't know where you're  going, you drive on the highway. I'll finish painting. Do I have a chance? Then I'm gone. Fuck the ceiling. Who looks up that often? This is it! Oh. Hello. I'm sorry. We thought it was going  to be empty. It is. No... We're your new neighbors. From next  door. Well. It's nice to meet you. Actually, we're here for the t.v. The people who left here -- our old  neighbors -- left us that t.v. Oh. It's very nice. We can manage. They're not done painting. It was just something to say. Yeah? Well, I had a big day. I went to my parent's house. Like  you said to. And there was this  ancient man, this giant man in the  doorway. And I thought, "It's my father. My  how he's aged." Not at the house. At the house I was  stone sober. He was very tall. He was too tall to  be my father. He was wearing a long  overcoat, and I thought, "it's a  trick, he's on my mother's shoulders". And then out from behind him came  this beautiful young girl... Beth. And they sang to me. They sang "London  Bridge is Falling Down"... "Falling down, falling down.". It was very touching. It was. Yeah? Okay. Yeah. I understand. I understand. I'll stop. I've stopped. Okay.
