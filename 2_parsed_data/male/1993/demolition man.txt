Wade did a little reminiscing. Wade's here. Well, he's sure working fast ain't he? Jesus. Sweet Jesus. We've got trouble. No chance. Not their sector. They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show. Something else. Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood. One Manny Turner. Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me. Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model. I got an artist working on a computer composite now. Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief. Things need straightening up in this city.It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all. I worked for him... still do. Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away. He kept his promise for twenty years. It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all. Your mother. Fuck you - fuck you. No, you're not model material. Anything else? Who are you? What the fuck do you want? Who is it?Talk fast. Polls open in half an hour. Yeah? I want this bastard brought down. This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning. That's him. Simon Doucet. I can smell it. Technothugs? What'cha got, Bennett? I don't want to hear anymore. You're crazy. What are you talking about? I heard about today. Good job. I'm all for capital punishment. Why don't you go home and see your family? What is it? I'm about to go on. You can't win like this. You'll only get older. This is what you wanted! Just got the call. Took him from school. Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher. Don't threaten me. I tend to take these things seriously. And get a couple hours sleep. You look like day old shit. This is a war, Wade. You against him. Vengeance time. The City's just in the way. Kill the fucker. You and me. We'll work things out when the time is right. And I want Doucet. Ah, fuck you, Wade. This is bull- shit. You're not going to kill me. You're not going to risk your freedom. You can't kill me. I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow. I'll be alright. Hello Wade. You're working a partner on this. The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be. When you bring in Doucet. We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process. No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging. 'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours. In that time he'll be an old man. Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome. Natural Pro- gression of Aging. It affects each individual differently. I'm sure it's painful. Edicon system made these. Ages, photographs. We use it to find missing children. Mug sheets. Fill it out. Standard issue mal- practice insurance. All Cops carry it. I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in. I don't care how. If you do, you'll get your freedom. An official pardon from me. A clean slate. A good job. A chance to get back with your family. If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted. Later. I want Doucet first. Well, you've just been taken off the bench. Jury found you guilty, not me. I just called it as I saw it. Fuck that. You were brought here for a reason. Doucet's escaped. Re-animated for his parole hearing. Killed a lot of people. Most of them cops. Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest. Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea. You look like shit. You have no evidence. Arrest this man. What the hell are you talking about? I'm thrilled beyond belief. You two fucks listen up. Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs. Forget it. Stick to the program. Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away. I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody. What's your status? Kill him... kill him. Wade's in Cryo-Prison. That's not your zone. Stick to data entry. I don't want any press on this. I've got an election to win day after to- morrow. Just great. Tell Doucet that. What was his rehabilitation training? What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape! Shut up! Drop it. Keep 'em busy. How do I look? Kill me if you want. Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit. But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'. You've got a family. I'm giving you a chance to see them. I kept in touch. She never married. All these years. Maybe she loves you. I wouldn't know why. Fine.Put that on your political resume. Prepare for a change in lifestyle. Speak up. You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade. I want to know who put you up to it. Funny guy. I want to ask you a few questions. My man Dubbs. Avon Lady! You want evidence. I'll give you evidence. Sir, your transmission's fading. But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages. We seem to've come across a 211, sir. Simon Doucet. You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air. He could be brought back. I was part of the escort team that re-animated him. My partner's dead because of this guy. And you should be with your family. No. I want to be with you. You be careful. I just heard. If you were set up, I want to find out who did it. Hospital food. Aaah... Mother of Jesus. That's just it. He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another. Judge threw out the cases each time. Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends. This should make your day. The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times. ...Have you been drinking? ...What are you talking about...? I'm here. What's this? How do I look? Rip Van Winkle. Comwatch Dispatch System . Can't assimilate voice stress. Code priority only. Simulated one. Wallet, cash, I.D... Let's roll. We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning. No, sir. No thank you, sir. Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy. You're just afraid to use this. You have technophobia, Wade. That's what you got. I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize. Crime's a science. Everything's analyzed. Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed. This area rates response to outside stimuli. Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen. It could be why he kills. Maybe I should turn myself in. That cost me two weeks' pay. Yes, sir. I'm serious, Wade. This case is important to me. We get to peek into Doucet's brain. Never use it. Stuff'll kill ya. Good night, Wade. You need anything else? Thanks. Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night. What's this place? Engaged. Plan on doing it this summer. You still married? It doesn't make sense. Who would want to do that to you? You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit? Why? I also PVC'd you. Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs. Four honor medals... Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today... How then? NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down. That's when we'll get him. Relax, let technology do the work. Give me a break. I'm serious. What's it like to be dead? Then what goes on in there? What I mean is, what are you thinking about? When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right? Can I ask you something? Thanks. Want'a bite? McDonald's vegiroll. My insurance won't cover it. You can't turn him off. He's the Commissioner. We don't know that for sure. We'll have to wait until they move. I'll inform dispatch. How do you know? Technothugs. Doucet killed my partner. Commissioner Gallagher said... ...twenty years is a long time. Whoa. Don't touch that. Pursuit Mode . Auto pilot. Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits. Installed Fall 2006. Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir. You have to use the steering wheel to turn. The pedal for gas... But Sergeant... Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory. Yes. Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy. Status G-8. Security Clearance 3. One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant. FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division--- Well I've got news for you. This dirty cop was the only cop who could bag Doucet. But he was such a good cop. He had a partner. Our own Ray Gallagher. He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic. Reckless. Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation. Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years. Take a look at this. What's it mean? Says here one of our boys brought him down. You ever heard of a badge named Wade? This is the guy that killed my partner.They always are. He went dirty and they made an example of him. You never want to find out. Demolition Man. You startin' a fan club or some- thin'? Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'? That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me. I was iced. What better way to keep me from talking. Stop me if I'm wrong. You were the dirty cop... and I was on to you. You panicked. Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up. You were planning to send me back to the ice house. You set me up. That wasn't your plan, was it? We have to talk. Not anymore. I'm wasting time. Where? Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya? Remember my promise. I want to stop aging. I'm not voting for you. Tell Frick and Frack that means them too. Out of the room. I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable. I'm going to kill you when this is all over. Give it to me. You son-of-a-bitch. How do you stop it? He's not that old yet. You've lost confidence in me. I remember what he looks like. I can't forget. What's this? I told you. I'm out of the cops and robbers business. Retired twenty years ago. I've been trained as a bus driver. Got a whole route planned and everything. Even nailed down the lingo - ' Exact change, please '. I want to see my wife and kid. I'm not on the force anymore. I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me. Shucks, and I got all dressed up. Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone. You should be in hospital. No you don't. I'm signing off. He's got my grandson, Sanchez. What are you doing this for, Sanchez? What is it? Your legs? Hands? You okay? So, he's got a thing for prison clothes. Yeah. Not yet. Your girl. Being a cop will be rough on her. You treat her nice. Sanchez...? We're partners, aren't we? Not too good. How ya feeling? Get us some fuck'n back-up now! Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before? Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock. What else did he get? You're not pregnant, are you? Wanna try? With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work. Who needs cops when you've got gizmos. Great. My partner's Marcus Welby. Lighten up. You're going to give yourself an ulcer. Two lousy smokes. You're a real sport. Then find me some cigarettes. You want to be a good detective? Hey, I'm eating. No. Talk English. Then I'll understand. I'll have a cup of coffee? Good night. I'll be okay. She's pretty. Yeah. This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago. Thought maybe he'd come back. Yeah. Least I think so. Twenty- six years this March. Married? Nothing makes sense when you're a cop. 'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close. Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs. He was going to turn me onto the big man. He made me for a cop. Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser. I was set up. Drop it. GCI. TM-1. What language are you talking? You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure. You do it by instinct. Think like him. Do what has to be dane. You can't catch this man with a computer. Hey, buddy... Trust me. You don't want to know. Bacon cheeseburgers. Yes. Pass. Wanna come? I'm not fond of television comedies. Well, I'm sure. You're a cop. I'm a cop. Let's do what cops do. There's no time. There are civilians in there. It's about to go down. Some things never change. They're going to rob that bank. See those guys? No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie? I have to go home, Sanchez. Lean year for role models. Got it. Ejection seat? Does it drive itself, too? Give me a break, Sanchez. It's like riding a bike. I'm ready. I drive. Well, that's good enough for me. Are you a cop? You my partner? Remember, get the seat fixed. Good to know you, Willy. What's your name? Yes. Seat's too high. You all right? I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company. It's stuck, but thanks for the offer. This little thing says I can't. Hi.NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast. Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives. Saying a prayer won't be bad either. Telephone repairman. It's a real mess down here. Some- thing must a'gone wrong. No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.Not the 'T' word. Go in the house. Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me. I got it. I got it. Bye. Thanks. William Simpson. I like Willy. I'm going to be a policeman. My granddad was a policeman. My mom says I'm gonna grow. Yeah.
