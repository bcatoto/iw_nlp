Sure you do -- you win either way. But of course. Soon, dark eyes, soon. So's mine. How fast is enough? With butter, if they got any.... What the hell. For you.... Well, I don't know.... You can? With the right wind, 15-20 knots. Get on the rocks! Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us! Don't! Bring her to port a little. That's it -- steady. Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean. What'd you do? Memorize the tide tables? Someone pop your balloon? Putz -- that won't be for hours. It's not going to be easy. Your dad must be really pissed. Turkeys! Eat wind! Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you. I could give you a dozen good reasons. Then why are we futzing around the dock? We can make a few bucks working at the beach. If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice? Maybe by now they are. Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love. Good. It's terrible. Is she responsible for the punch? We're hung up on something. Why'd they decide to move? No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic. Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky. Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson. Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean. What the hell. Did your mom put all this together? They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups. The Shark. Shit. Shit, shit, shit! We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear? Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me? Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse. I don't know. Sean! Catch it! There's a shark.... You're betting what you already got. Like hell! We're on the starboard tack! We're carrying weight.Can you get us a line? The rope! The rope! Over here! Anyone got another set of sails? You coming up on him? Want to talk about it? I thought you said she was going with us? Gangway, Turkies!I need a hand here.... What is it? What's there? It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey --- Tina! Oh, yeah. Sure. Got it. Never mind that shit. Just point. I'm going out there. Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there. Untie that rope. Mike's out there. You can't stop me. How long ago? Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone. Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay? The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it? Not the drugstore! You got it. Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it.... That one -- from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside it? What about that camera? The woman passenger on the boat that blew up. You didn't miss much. Christ, what a mess. In here. Could you just keep that crowd back, please? If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel. Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that. I just made it up. It means, "Get me out of there." What the hell's that? Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908. Then check it out. I'll be in the office. On your own time? Aren't you off-duty? Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here. What? Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others? At least you're safe. What about the others? It's okay. What happened? Mike? Is that you? No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. You can work until school starts. Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats. I got something for you to do tomorrow. You want to come here a minute? Michael. Not till next year. You stay right here. You're going in with me. You heard me. You stay here a minute. Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh? We've had a lot of trouble. Look, humor the old man -- just be careful. Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day? What about tennis? Riding? fixing up old cars? Bartending? You'll have to make up your own mind about that. You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school. Every day? Sailing? Where to? Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around. What else you got? Did you get any pictures? You said something about a camera. It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again. Ever! Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way. Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary. There is nothing to discuss. My ass! You're damn right that's what it is. What are you all, blind? It's a shark. Look -- teeth, jaw, gills. Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along. Temporarily? Uh...sure.... Too late, it's written. Sorry, I'm all booked up... Come, m'dear. All of us thank you, okay? Me neither. Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy.... Can't you tell? So there's one around here. Sound? That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around.... Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did this. Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish.... Is there one in these waters? That's it. I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan.... Look, I know a little bit about sharks. But that's what we're here to find out, right? The shark that did this. It was a shark, wasn't it? The Shark's mouth. Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth? Come on, let's check the bite radius. Look at that: As soon as I heard about it, I called you. This thing is big! His arms indicate big. Mike's out there. Going out. Just one minute.... Don't rush into it -- we may need the income. Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss. I try. Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm.... Fired me! I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw.... ...Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass.... Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me.... No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous. Then that's what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that. What'd I say? Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all. That's great too. Gorgeous. That's great. Yeah. I think so. Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake! The goddamn smell is always the same. In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. Call the cops. What are we, immune? I know what you're going to say. He wanted a job, he's got one. I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night. No. Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal. That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff? Nothing. Oww! Santos' place. Oh, hi -- How was dinner? Damn. For me? Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating? Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat He's another one. In the den. What're you guys doing today? It's good with coffee. Better yet. Need a ride? Mrs. Silvera? Good. Sean's awake. Mmmm. Home it is. Right. Listen -- what are you doing later? I did, I did. Remember 1959, the Jersey shore? Because they're playing our song. Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man? Do I have to talk to those two? Late. Go ahead, whatever it's worth. What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand? I've seen this sonofabitch before! What? Perfect. Look at this --- Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you. Proof! Someone has to do something. Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it! Maybe they are! Two of them are still missing! Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers.... It's still a good idea. I know, I know.... We have to do something. I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you? Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator.... Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one. We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone. Very impressive ceremony. Good speech. When? Did you say Cable Junction? Yeah? Then what? Did he raise the Kids? Where the hell is Air One? Harbor Air, do you read? Over? If they're not at the light, look for them. I don't want them out there. Get them back to port! That's it. Just do it, all right? There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port. Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse. Right now. Affirmative. Can you get your chopper airborne? Sure they did.... I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay.... Hang on! Hiya yourself. You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay? Some people. No. Find your brother, okay? Shouldn't he be at home?Swim for it! Back down! Stop paddling! I think we're changing course a little. It's okay, it's okay.... I can't help it it sticks in my mind. Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m. No problem, no problem. Oh, shit. That's what I want -- a gaff rig. None at all. I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night. I know. Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest. Tina Wilcox. Me neither. Get a dance yet? Sideways - For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way.... The wind drift is lateral. I can't stop thinking! By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out. More, with this wind. They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy. 3:30.You got it. Anything. Anything. Mmmmmm. But first, a little juice.... I dunno. We'll think of something. They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started. The tide's running. It'll take us to the light. Just like this. Give me back my hat! Come on back up here! Next week. Huh?See where Cable Junction is? Look to the left. The lighthouse. That's it. About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast.... Hey -- you can't do that. You're too close. Back off. Please. It's my job. But I signed for the boat. You' re not authorized any more. I can't let you take her out. About an hour, maybe two. Let's see -- I came on about eight.... Right. Nine-thirty, ten maybe. Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me. I know just where to go. If there is, develop it! What camera? Oh. Positive I.D.? I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here. Chief? We got a helluva tide this month. If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation. Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode Island. Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser. I never heard of a 908. Chief.... Happy to do it. Till noon. This is on my own time. Hi, Shorty. Good morning! Anything? What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right? Which way are we going? Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go. Neither of you can go. Yep. Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse. All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang. Right after, the Kids went out? Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island. Oh, great. What is it? What the hell is it? Until we find something. Happens every season -- someone takes off. Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting. Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.What the hell, we're steering for it. Throw it. As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in. My dad's the mayor.... Loser sails home alone. Coming up! Give way! We'll take your supercargo. We're hung up here. Snagged. Sean! Catch the rope! Hey! How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...? You bet. Hang on.... Want to swim home? Let's just go sailing, okay? Coming up! What's that mean? Shut up. Maybe it's gone. Anyone know what time it is?I was counting on hours. We better go back in. Yee-hah! Shut up. Why not? Yeah. They're moving pretty fast. I hope that's the cousin. No. Yeah, it's her job. Dad, I'm sorry.... Sean's still out there. I passed out, but I'm okay. Pop. I'm sorry. Hey, come on.... I kind of had plans.... Yeah? Is Hooper coming to dinner? Pop.... Oh, c'mon. Okay, okay. I'll be careful. I'll see y'later. Because. Bartending? I'm 17. I'm going. Do I have to? What else is there to do? I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing. No place special. Just hanging out. Maybe. Great. I will, I will. Waiting for Andy. Great. I'm not crazy about blind dates. How old is your cousin? We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide. I don't care. Name it. I can go out if I want to. No. That's not it. My dad told me not to go. Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach.... I'm not sure I can. I'll be right there. Wait up. Too hot tor those two? I can't believe it. It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know.... Would you take him? Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home. Okay, okay. Close your door. Quiet! Shhh! No. Maybe. Yeah. Eat Cheerios. Yeah. Go on, beat it. How was dive class? I don't need you. Andy's here.He's got to help or it won't work. Might as well. Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in.... If we beat them, they can both go home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat! Coming about....1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out. That's what he said. Then nothing. If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself. Last transmission said ten juve- niles. That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction. Brody? This is Patrol Base. Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port. I heard you. Patrol out. 10-4, soon as I can raise him. That's it? What for? 10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.What's that supposed to mean? You don't make enough. Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him? You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us? That could ruin us. What have you seen before? This is nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Some- thing in the lens. Is that what it is? It came up during the meeting. Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence? Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer. Don't you have any pull with the chief, here? Wait a minute.... May I have this dance? Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town. Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd do without her. Forget it, he won't listen. So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple. Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else. You should've been out there. You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac. There were shots fired! What the hell is he doing? How the hell do we get him down. from there? Oh, shit. I think we got a couple of live ones. And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.Okay, okay -- stand over there.... Let's see -- you got a minute? Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion, though.... Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing. You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up. Here's a test I did.... Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he.... I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped. I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days. Believe me, it's a pleasure....They're turning around. Anyone want to go the lighthouse? You going with Patrick? When are we going out? You and me?Now you're talking. Let's get out of here before we do find something. It comes here from Cable Junction. Power line. About damn time. I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry. And cold. And most of all, bored. How much longer? Figure they split?They made me go with them. Dad! Dad! Hi Dad. Can I go with you today? What's daddy doing? Can I go swimming? Mom, Michael won't talk to me. Yeah. I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in the way? Michael.... I want to go with you! Take me. You're going sailing. You're going out. You eat Cheerios. I want Fruit Loops. I want Fruit Loops! Do I have to play with the little kids? You always go with Andy.Help! Help! Hang on, hang on...Okay, go. Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play with the dolphins without skis.... Great! Did you ever see a dolphin?Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner. No class. That's a crock of shit. You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend. Who'd you ask? Nope.Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something? Martin, it could be anything. Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer. Martin, this is kind of an official meeting Don't push it this time. If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that. What am I, an ass? When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything. Bullshit. There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims? A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident. Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke. And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all lost on that one. We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know. Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money. No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing. Be realistic. Are you serious? We're alone. I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going. Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don't you? Hello, hello. It went well, I thought. Be reasonable, please.... Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over. We have to deal with the consequences. So? So? He thought he had a good reason. Oh, my God.... Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus. Wave to my son. Brody's riding his tower. Len, can I see you a minute?
