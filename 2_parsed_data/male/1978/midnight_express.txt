Pan American Flight 1 to Frankfurt,  London, and New York has arrived  and will be ready for boarding at  Gate 7 in 20 minutes. I think I've been poisoned. Look, I think I'm going to have to  go to the john again.  You go on  through, I'll catch up. Passport! Bag! Nebu? It's a frisbee. Nebu? A Frisbee. You throw, catch it.  Game! American game. Baseball. Ah! Take off the glasses. Aaaah! Yeah... Yeah. Never was anybody like you... You're right. Attention please, Ladies and  Gentlemen. For your own safety  we're conducting a security check  before you board your airplane,  Kindly file out the back. Women  and children in one line. Men in  another. What's he saying?  I don't know...  Marian.  Hey Marian, what the  hell... Idem. They're checking for hijackers.   Any Palestinians aboard? Hey Harry,  get rid of your grenades... My passport! Susan - forget it. Go get us a  seat on the plane. Now. For Christ's sake, just GET on the  plane, okay! Just a minute! Nebu? Did you search him? No! (grunts a command, makes a gesture) Bomb!  He's got a bomb! Bomb!  Bomb! It's hashish. just a smuggler. Hashish...smuggler...hippy... William Hayes. Vi... Vilyum... Vilyum... Hayes. Hi-yes... 'Merican? New York. New York... New York... Ahhhh...Nev Yok! Name? William Hayes. Vil... Vilyum...? Hayes... No.. He's smiling. Make him look  miserable. Gel?  Gel?? I forgot... I really did. You worthless piece of garbage,  where did you learn to search a  prisoner?  He's been in our custody  for an hour, etc. Who searched him?  Who? That's it! That's all I have! Howdy, Billy. Howya doing, Ok? I think these gentlemen have  finished for the time being if  you'd like to put your clothes on. Are you afraid, Vilyum? No, I'm not afraid. Good. There's nothing to be afraid  of. If you co-operate with us, you  will be on the plane for New York  tomorrow... yes? Yes...? Good. Now, where did you get the  hashish? A cabdriver. He picked me up in  the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar. Would you recognize him again? Yes.  I think so. Good.  Would you go back to the  Pudding Shoppe now and point him  out to my men if you see him? Yes. You decided to fly at a bad time  Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all  over the place blowing up planes  and all. Stupid. Four planes in four days...but I  guess you kids don't read the  newspapers...and what with our  people kicking up a shit storm  'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey  you got... But didn't have heroin. Well I'm not up on all that. A  drug's a drug seems to me Billy  and... But it was my first time. I'm not  really a smuggler, was just two  kilos. Well, you see Billy, it don't really  matter right now if it's 2 kilos  or 200 kilos. The Turks love to  catch any foreigner smuggling - it  shows the world they're fighting  the drug trade. But just... Just what? I just needed some extra money.  I  was broke, the guy offered me the  hash and... ...are you with the Consulate? Something like that. Cigarette? How much you pay this joker...  this cab driver? Two hundred dollars. It was my  last two hundred. How much did you figure to make? Three, four thousand...I don't  know.  The guy offered me the hash-- ...it just seemed like easy money. Beats working. I was just going to sell it to  friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest. Got a family back there? Yeah. Parents, brother, sister.   Babylon, Long Island. What's your father do? He sells insurance for Metropolitan  Life. Be tough on 'em. Girlfriend? ...She was on the plane. She didn't know anything about...I  wouldn't have wanted her to. Lucky girl. Jeez, she used to say I was the  lucky one. Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure  hope so. Hey Janet, why don't you go sell  'em some dope. You seem like a nice enough kid to  me Billy, but try it and I'll blow  your fucking brains out. Dear Mom and Dad. This is the  hardest letter I've ever had to  write. know the confusion and the  pain it will cause you.  And the  disappointment... I really thought knew what I was  doing with my life. I'd hoped  somehow to get out of this quickly  so that you'd never know about it.  But that just isn't possible now.  I don't know what's going to happen.   But what can I say to you?  Will  'I'm sorry' make a difference?   Will it ease the pain, the shame  you must be feeling?  Forgive  me...Please... Git! Cold. Very cold. Can I get blanket?   Blanket? Mo sell...Too late.  Tomorrow... You be here tomorrow.  "Ayi  Gedjaler"("good night") Pssst! (Whispering)  Your cell, no key.  Open...!   Blanket. Three cell down. You get  me one. Take... Ziat go for night.  Go! Brack!...Brack! You, goddamn you, give me sheet.   Give me! Name? Vilyum Hi-yes Vilyum Hi-yes... Vilyum Hi-yes It was cold. Cold! I get blanket.   Blanket! Cold! No do. No do. Hey man, he's gotta walk, or his  feet gonna swell up worse. We take him down to courtyard... Okay? How's it feel? About as good as it looks. Getchmis...? Just Erich. I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used  to be. Looks like a cheap hotel. Feeling all right? Yeah.  That guy who beat me? I feel stoned. ...He had a bald skull and... No... I don't remember. The kids? Why are they... Yeah. Two kilos. The airport. Trying to get on the  plane for the States. Twenty months? Years? Don't pay too much attention,  anything is possible in Turkey.  You might get bail. ...If you make bail, you're free.  You can get a fake passport or  sneak across the border to Greece.  The Greeks hate the Turks so much  they never send you back. The Turks  know it. They just keep the bail.  money. The law is sometimes wrong. New people sometimes get on his  nerves. What did he do? He was caught steeling from a  Mosque.  That's heavy here.  He  got 30 years. Thirty years? Jimmy has more balls than brains.  He didn't tell his parents he was  in jail for a year and a half.  He  says he got himself in and now  he's going to get himself out. And you? Hashish.  Ninety percent of the  foreigners are in for hashish. What they give you? Twelve years. How much did you have? A hundred grams. It's not fair! There is no fair in Turkey, Billy.   It's all "sula-bula" like this,  like that. An Italian hippie had a  car accident and a Turk was killed.  SO, they threw him in here for six  months... That doesn't seem so bad. But he was eating lunch a mile  away when the Turk smashed into  killed himself. He wasn't even in the car? Aslan, there... Killed a guy. But his father's a  big gangster on the docks.  A  "Kapidiye."  He'll stay in... twelve  months no more, and get parole. In  Turkey, murder is manly - "erkek". You just got to get yourself a  good lawyer.  And some money...  Talk to Max.  He's been in the  longest. How long? Seven years... Gastro.  Stomach medicine. Has  codeine in it... Best can do Lawyers? Yeah... there's no straight lawyers  in Turkey... They're all bent bent  as hairpins... His name? Who? The lawyer? What lawyer? Who got the Frenchman out? Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but  I...don't know anything...  'bout...Yesil... Best way is get your ass out...  any... way... you can... What do you mean? Get the... midnight... express. What's that? Billy! Dad! Dad...I'm... ...Don't worry about it. I can punch you in the nose later.   Right now we've got to get you out  of here.  You all right? Yeah. How's Mom? Bad. She couldn't make the trip.   You know Her boy... Susan told us before we got your  letter. She's fine; she's trying  to get the money to come back and  see you, but... No, don't let her!  I'll... How  about Peg? Robbie? Same. None of the neighbors know.   We told them you were in a hospital  in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley  Davis. He's the American Consul  here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer  you wanted... Hello, Billy. Hello. I want you to know we're going to  do everything, in our power to get  you out as soon as possible. Believe  me. Thank you. Mr. Yesil. If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they  say it's easy to cross the border  into Greece? Right!  That's what we're shooting  for.  Mister Davis and have been  in contact with the State  Department, but right now relations  with the Turks aren't too good,  Nixon's upset the hell out of them.   Our best bet's... right here. Dad... I'll pay you back for all this, I  Promise. Don't worry about it.  Right now  money doesn't count. Okay? Where'd you get that limp? Nothing. Just twisted my ankle. Where you staying, Dad? The Hilton. How do you like it?  Istanbul? Well, it's an interesting place... Tell you the truth, I think the  food is lousy. The crap they sell  in these little restaurants. I  went out to eat in one of them  last night, and I had to run to  the damn toilet... You shoulda'  seen the toilet. You mean you got toilets? Yeah, with real toilet paper - and  you don't have to use both sides. So now I'm eating at the Hilton  every night. Why'd you do it, Billy? For the money... I know you kids smoke that stuff,  and we drink booze, but taking it  across a border - it was stupid,  Billy. Stupid. I know. Dad get me out of here. Okay. THE world is now looking at Turkey.  We are called the Heroin Supplier  of the world.  Stories about us  are in newspapers and on television  every day all around the world.  The time has come, your Honor, to  alter this image before we find  ourselves isolated and morally  ostracized by the rest of the human  race... ...We must alter this image by  punishing only our own drug  smugglers-but by handing out  foreigners who infest our culture  with their depravity ungodly and  behavior.  We must start now - by  sentencing this American, Vilyum  Hi-yes, to the maximum sentence  for smuggling, to be held up to  the light of the world as an example  of Turkish justice and its intention  to halt the drug trade once and  for all.. .I ask the Court therefore  to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to Life  Imprisonment. Thank you, Prosecutor. The Court  will now recess to consider its  verdict. What'd the Prosecutor say? Did you ask for bail? The Defendant has been found guilty  by the Court of the illegal  possession of Hashish... ...Therefore. this court sentences  you, Vilyum Hi-yes to be imprisoned  at Sagamilcar Prison for a term of  four years and two months. This  Case is now closed. Four years! ...With good time Billy it works  out to about 3 years... then there's  the appeal.  Yesil, Davis, they're  all working for you We're going to   try to make a deal to get you  transferred to a Stateside prison.  And Davis thinks there might be a  political amnesty any month... Look - I know it sounds tough,  Billy, but we're gonna get you  out... ...I promise you, but I don't want  you to get stupid again. Pull  anything.  They can play with your  sentence. I'm putting $500 in the bank for  you.  Anything you need you write... There's food, candy, writing paper,  soap, books... ...cigarettes, soap, tooth-brush,  there's... Jesus! I been writing insurance policies  on people for thirty goddamn  years... And now I gotta see my own  son...Jesus! Jesus!  If I could be  where you are Billy, I'd be there...  Goddamn Jesus!  These bastards. DAD! Oh Jesus! You take good care of my boy, you  hear, or I'll have your fucking  head, you Turkish bastard! Dear Susan.  1970 has now passed  into 1971.  You can drift in here  and never know you're gone. You  can fade so far out and you don't  know where you are anymore or where  anything else is... I find loneliness is a physical  pain which hurts all over; you  can't isolate it in one part of  your body. I so much need your  softness, your strength. I have  your letters. They charge me, give  me courage.News about amnesty and  getting out - tangled,  complicated... ...I feel myself drifting more  heavily into smoking hashish. The  haze helps the time pass. Also I  do soap carvings.  Erich taught  me. And I have been learning Turkish  because it helps me to deal with  the guards and the prisoners. I'm  trying hard to maintain some sort  of schedule to my life, but  sometimes it seems like I'm just  trying in order to try... ... In the daytimes we sometimes  play volleyball against the big  Turkish gangsters... ...To the Turks all foreigners are  "ayip" - unclean, dirty. We don't  shave our under-arms or around our  crotch... Even the yoga I sometimes do is  "ayip" - too suggestive... And you're never supposed to eat  with your left hand. You know why? Because that's what they use to  wipe their asses with instead of  toilet paper.  And yet they hate  pigs. There are no pigs in Turkey.  They're considered dirty... So is homosexuality. That's a big  crime here but most of them do it  every chance they get.  There are  about a thousand things that are  "ayip".  But they're really so  hypocritical, like children breaking  the rules. For instance... ...You can stab or shoot some body  the but not above the waist because  that's intent to kill. So everybody  runs around stabbing everyone else  in the ass.  That's what they call  'Turkish revenge'.  There's also a  lot of "Baksheesh" that's a favorite  Turkish word for bribery... Unfortunately my youngest son Arief  is having problems with his teeth;  he needs braces, but dentists are  so expensive these days Poor kid... You know I have a  friend, a very good friend; he's a  dentist; maybe he could get you  some braces at a... reasonable  price. Oh, no...it's out of the  question...wouldn't want to ask  your friend... Yes. Please! As a favour... I insist Hamidou hints that he needs new  braces for one of his sons.  Aslan  of course has a friend who's a  dentist.  They bullshit for half  an hour and Hamidou finally accepts  the "Baksheesh" in return... Dope and all kinds of shipments  get delivered to Aslan, who re- sells it through his runners. People  like Ziat.  But one night, it  backfired... There were thousands of yellow  nembutols.  Aslan as usual had the  privilege of going into the  courtyard before anybody else to  pick up his stuff but... ...it happened to be a new guard  that day and he didn't understand  the system. No. It's too early. Open the fucking Gate, you asshole!   Do you know who I am? You want to  get in trouble! Hey, I your mother! Get back to  your bunk. Aslan...be reasonable. Come down  and talk. You come up here and talk! Aslan... if you give up the gun,  you can keep the bullets A week later Aslan had a new gun... ...I know all this must sound crazy  to you, but this place is crazy... Everything is "sula-bula" which  means "like this, like that" - you  never know what will happen. One  day one of the new kids was raped  in the children's kogus, so they  picked out six of the worst kids... PIS!  PIS" You see Mamur, Mamet - what happens  when you're not a good boy. Then there's Ziat.  The more I  know of him... ...the more hate him. Ten dollars for this shit?  You  greedy one-eyed git. NO!   Is good! Me good shit. No!  You big shit! Yeah! Efe big shit. JAAAASH! You asshole! Hikmet come here boy.  Hikmet What is it with you man, what the  hell is it? Cat, ah!  Ayip! You're ayip! Look, you don't fuck with me, I  don't fuck with you, right? But you fuck with me. You fuck  with me all the time. You make  crummy tea.  You rip us off on the  hash. I make special tea for you, Hiyes,  okay?  We've to live like brothers.   We have to be in here together. Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money  you have, you have nothing! You 'Merican.  You don't know. Know what? Was.. ...seven years old. I was on street  in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to  take care. I learn. Learn what? Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other  man before he fuck you. And you must fuck last. That's a great philosophy. You 'Merican.  You don't know. Here Hikmet!  Come down here boy!   Hikmet... Sodding cat! ...My dearest Billy. I know it is  long and it is hard for you, but  your family and I are thinking  about you all the time. I am trying  hard to make enough money nights  to come and see you.  Your father  says that lawyer Yesil wants another  $2000.  I know you distrust him  more and more, but your father  wants to do everything he can, and  he is borrowing all he can on the  mortgage of the house.  Money seems  to be the only way out of there.  Except of course the other way... ...But I cannot say I am for it.   Nor are your parents. They consulted  the priest, and he said to send  you money for that reason would be  like sealing your death. To what? Too bad you didn't have a machine. Tunnel? Gotta be here someplace.  Thought  I heard a couple of dead Christians  singing down there. But how would you get into the  shaft, Jimmy? I suppose you knock three times  and ask for St. Peter. We go through the wall? We go through the wall. And what do you do when you in the  catacombs? You gotta be fucking crazy!  You  got stabbed in the ass once too  much, sweetheart, cause you're  gonna end up in Section 13, that's  what - not the 'catacombs. Section 13? Yeah,  for the criminally insane. I was there once for two weeks and  it ain't an illusion. It's awful.   Namidou runs it like a death camp,  that's where he spends most of his  time... Where is it? I don' t know. It's someplace down  in there.... ..deep.. A big door...a wheel.... Shit. ...The roof sounds better to me  than digging through a wall.  Ziat's  round there all the time. But the  roof.... The bullet percentage is awful  high. If I get caught, Jimmy, I'm facing  another months. I'd be back up to  3 years, maybe more... Dear Susan. Poor Jimmy was caught  and beaten so badly he got a severe  hernia and lost a testicle. He's  been in the hospital for months  having operations.. ...In comparison my problems seem  very small. But two and a half  years have now gone by, and in  their own fashion, the Turks are  slowly draining my life away... ...I have problems with my stomach  and my leg muscles feel very weak.   My gums seem to be shrinking and  they sometimes bleed when I massage  them... They've pulled five of my  teeth... ...sometimes they null the wrong  one... ...even my dreams don't seem to  work any more. Because the outside  doesn't seem real any more. It's  not even a fantasy...because there  is no fantasy. Even masturbation has become boring.   It teaches you, like the rest of  prison life, to seal up your  emotions, and this is the greatest  danger, this is what makes so many  of the men change into something  monstrous... It is Erich who has taught me how  it is to be conscious, to channel  and direct my energy.  He has  convinced me to stop smoking  hashish, he is the calmest man I  have ever known.  If you don't  control your energy in here if can  blow you apart like with Bell. And  you can't waste it either.  You  have to weigh up every one of your  actions - for and against.  Too  little sex, too much sex either  will throw you off balance... ...he has taught me about feelings,  and the need to express them.  And  he has taught me about love... ...and what love really is, beyond  its physical forms.. .I think up  to now I have only considered my  own self, never really another... ...and now strange as it seems,  Susan, without having seen you in  so long I feel myself more inside  of you than ever before. I feel  your female mind.  I sense you,  touch you; ...know you; and find  myself falling more and more...   in love with you. A prison a monastery a cloister a  cave, Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister... Prison. Dear Susan. Erich has been  transferred to a prison back in  Sweden. He has profoundly affected  my life and though I am lonely  without him I am calmer than ever... Though I only have 53 days left, I  feel I have never been so well  adjusted to prison and to living  as now.... ...Poor Jimmy... ...Though his health is bad he  still won't give up... ...He still talks of escape. What's wrong? Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm  afraid I have some bad news for  you. Something happen to Dad?... Mom? No... It looks like your going to  have a new court. What do you mean? The Prosecutor objected to your  sentence for possession; he wanted  a smuggling conviction and the  High Court in Ankara reviewed it. And? We've been notified that they  rejected the sentence... There were 35 judges on the High  Court. Twenty eight of them voted  for a life sentence. The Lower Court in Istanbul will  have to go along with the decision.   The Judge likes you and he'll do  the only thing he can do under the  law.... . He'll reduce the sentence  to thirty years... We're notified...  Billy. What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! Billy!  Please! FOR WHAT!  FOR WHAT! I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT! I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT! ...What is the crime?  And what is  the punishment?  The answer seems  to vary from place to place, and  from time to time. What's legal  today is suddenly illegal tomorrow  cause some society says it's so;  and what's illegal yesterday all  of a sudden gets legal today because  everybody's doing it and you can't  throw everybody in jail. Well I'm  not saying this is right or wrong.   It's just the way things are.... But I spent the last three and a  half years of my life in your prison  and I think I paid for my error  and if it's your decision today to  sentence me to more years, I... And I've been playing it cool and  I've been good and now I'm damn  tired of being good cause you people  gave me the belief that I had 53  days left.  You hung 53 days in  front of my eyes and then you took  those 53 days away, and Mister  Prosecutor!  I just wish you  could... ... stand right here where I'm  standing and feel what that...  ...feels like, cause then you'd  know something you don't know you'd  know what means, Mister Prosecutor  and you'd know the concept of a  society is based on the quality of  its mercy means, of its sense of  fair play, its sense of justice...  but I guess that's just like asking a  bear to shit in a toilet... For a nation of pigs, it's funny  you don't eat them.  Fuck it, give  me the sentence. Jesus forgave the  bastards, but I can't. I hate you.   Nation. I hate your I hate your  people. And I fuck your sons and  daughters! ...cause you're all pigs. Would Your honor like me to  translate? That won't be necessary My hands are tied by Ankara! My hands are tied by Ankara! I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes... ... to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar  for a term no less than thirty  years...Getchmis olsun "I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes,  to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar for  a term no less than years...  "Getchmis Olsun" "May it pass quickly." "Mmmmm... got the blues babe,  Got those old Istanbul blues,  Said Yeah, I got the blues babe  Got those old Istanbul blues...   Thirty years in Turkey, babe,  Ain't got nothing left to lose..." "Busted at the border  Two keys in my shoes  Said I was busted at the border  with two keys in my shoes  An they gave me thirty years, babe  To learn the old Istanbul blues..." "I said Lord now save me "I said Lord come and save me,  Come save me from this pain  Come set me free sweet Jesus..." Hey knock off that shit music... ...We're playing the sas. KNOCK IT OFF! Cut it!  No more fights. We're getting out of here. Dear Susan. It's taken me a long  time to find out that it's got to  stop somewhere. I've learned  painfully not to trust the Turks,  the courts, the lawyers, the Consul,  the United States Government, and  not even my loving parents. There  is only one way out of here.. The  Midnight Express. We're undermining the other stones! It's there! Listen! Fuck me! You beautiful mother,  you! Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea  will ay! Work, work, work, that's all do I don't hear you bitch about the  money. You want to split your hernia again? Get off our tits! No. No time. Put 'em back. We go early. Any fuck-ups we should  be back here and have the stones  in by dawn. You got your stuff? Yeah. Everything. Okay. Let's do it. Okay? Yeah! Jimmy? How's your hernia? What do you mean, you forgot, he'll  have my ass! Well I can't do two things at once,  you were supposed to be here at  nine o'clock! Jesus! Anybody bitten? They went out over there: must be  some kind of exit. Let's go back the other way. What time is it? Two thirty. Shit!  Shit!  Shit! It's a dead end. The Turks musta'  sealed it up. We go back. What?  You gotta be joking. We go back, seal it up again, and  come in tomorrow night - every  night 'till we get out of here.   There's gotta be a way. Those bats  got out someplace. Now let's go.  Doubletime! You gotta have a lot of balls for  this Yeah, what if got caught? Hey Max, don't make the dummy laugh. Who's laughing?  I mean I find  this terribly depressing... Can  you see old Hamidou's face when he  tries to figure this one out? We'll tell him we were checking  out our escape route.  We wanted  to be completely sure before we  tried it. Who? Shut up! No do!  No do!  I tell you I see  you again.. Finish! Take him! You bastard! This time I'm gonna  kick your fucking brains all over  this kitchen! Fine.  Good.  Man to man.  We fight  now.  And when finish I bring  Hamidou and he kick you fuckinq  ass. Max! Cool it! Ziat's just doing his job. Bell's gonna talk. They got to  find out. Man, we gotta out. Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making  me blind. Hey Billy! Yeah. I got some acid man.  Maybe we can  drop some on the guards huh? In  their tea or something. Yeah I got it all worked out.   Billy, listen to me. That old guard likes you, You drop  some acid on him.  When he's Seeing  rainbows yer know. walk out -  tonight. Then we're outside the kogus.   Then what? What? After we're outside the kogus? Oh we... we... Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire... Oh shit!  Oh Christ! There just comes a time you know...   you know you're never going to git  it on. That's what I'm gonna do. What? Cut his fucking throat. Whose? ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh!   What do I got to lose. And I'd  really enjoy it. Max, sit down. You're in no shape  to kill anybody. I want to cut his throat. It's already been cut. Then I'll cut his balls off. If you really wanted to hurt Ziat ...His money - steal that, you  steal his blood... Could you see  his face when everything he worked  so hard to get got snatched? If we knew where he hid it. Anyway, steal from him they'd pick  up the whole prison and shake it  sideways.  We couldn't hide it  anywhere. You know where it is? What? I know where it is. His money? 'Dem dat hides can finds says I'...  I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking  looks at it late at night, talking  to it. Yeah? Where? Hishradyo. Max - where? His radio Back of his open, radio... That's why he never plays it... Down here! We found it! He never had one. I'll drink to that. Just got some news on Bell. What? Bad. Sent to the City Hospital.   They ruptured his hernia again. Oh shit. I Guess he didn't talk...Poor  bastard. Why the suit? Maybe he's changing jobs. SAYIM!  SAYIM! Nebu? Nebu? What's going on?  Maybe Ziat can't  pay off; Hamidou's taking it out  in trade. Where did you get this hash? From Max. You got to be kidding. What's happening with this hash? I didn't sell it to him. I don't  have anything to do with this, I know your face. Where did you  get the hash? (He knows nothing about it.  Ziat's  lying. You, goddamn you, shut up! Take him to the cellar) Get out of here! He's lying!  That  cock-sucker!  Billy...? ZIAT! Asina covacim, ipnave  pesankek...yosakt. HELP ME!  GUARDS!

They say I  raped a little boy. I have been  here very long time. They will  never let me go. They won't let YOU go either. No, they'll never let you go.
