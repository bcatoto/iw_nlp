Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay! That's a great philosophy. Learn what? Know what? Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing! But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea. You rip us off on the hash. You're ayip! What is it with you man, what the hell is it? Did you ask for bail? What'd the Prosecutor say? If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece? Mr. Yesil.Billy! Please! We've been notified that they rejected the sentence... The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it. No... It looks like your going to have a new court. Sit down a moment, Billy. I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me. Hello, Billy.Good. Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him? Would you recognize him again? Good. Now, where did you get the hashish? Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?Ah, look! they probably know where the campers are All over. Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us. You sure you looking for your friends, man? How much? No! I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car. Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not? Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends? Sixty Lira? How far? You know where they are?Seven years... You just got to get yourself a good lawyer. And some money... Talk to Max. He's been in the longest. Aslan, there... But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself. There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months... A hundred grams. Twelve years. Hashish. Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish. New people sometimes get on his nerves. Feeling all right? Just Erich. How's it feel? Who got the Frenchman out? The lawyer? His name? Lawyers?Oh Jesus! I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid. Why'd you do it, Billy? Well, it's an interesting place... Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet. The Hilton. Where'd you get that limp? Don't worry about it. Right now money doesn't count. Okay? Right! That's what we're shooting for. Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here. Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe. Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted... Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy... Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but... ...Don't worry about it. I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here. You all right?Everything. Shit. And what do you do when you in the catacombs? Gotta be here someplace. Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there. Too bad you didn't have a machine. To what? Maybe he's changing jobs. Oh shit. What? His radio Back of his open, radio... Hishradyo. 'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it. I know where it is. You know where it is? Then I'll cut his balls off. I want to cut his throat. ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it. Cut his fucking throat. Oh we... we... What? Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me. That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him. When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight. I got some acid man. Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something. Goddamn Gastro's killing me. Making me blind. Hey Billy! What? You gotta be joking. It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up. Two thirty. Yeah! Yeah. I don' t know. It's someplace down in there.... ..deep.. A big door...a wheel.... Yeah, for the criminally insane. I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time... You gotta be fucking crazy! You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs. I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter. Get the... midnight... express. Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can... Oh Yesil... Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil... What lawyer? Who? Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...Let's hope so, Billy. Let's sure hope so. Lucky girl. Girlfriend? Be tough on 'em. What's your father do? Got a family back there? Beats working. How much did you figure to make? How much you pay this joker... this cab driver? Something like that. Cigarette? Just what? Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade. Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got... You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.Work, work, work, that's all do You 'Merican. You don't know. Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you. And you must fuck last. Was.. ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk. Buy. Sell. No family to take care. I learn. I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?
