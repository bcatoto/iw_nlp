Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange... Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story? Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary? It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary. Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in. We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home...

I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here? No. Yeah. I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars. Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal.

I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find. The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that! You loaded it, Vince! I saw you! In the timeless words of Squire Albert... Sure. Yeah. They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths. One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun. Never one. No. Naw. Uh-huh. Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A! What the hell's that for? Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great! Cynthia! Sure. Well, who'd you get married to?

Are we going home? Merle? Merle, I wanna go home! This is horrible! I want to go home, Merle. No. No, no. Who the hell is he? Yeah! No. Phantom Mary? Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be -- But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this? Merle gave me this? Merle? ... Merle's alive? How do you know? Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now. Where? You didn't get a deer? Did you get one? Did you go hunting. Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home. Hey, Nick. How can you need me? I gotta get back, Nick. Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean -- I'm gonna stay here, Nick. Listen, Nick -- John Wayne... Listen, Nick -- What? Same. Hey. Same old stuff. Nick. Hey. How's things? See you Monday. That's my plan. I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down. Right. You guys are crazy. You know that?

This is it, but they changed it. It is too! Now you passed it! I'll get it! Where is it? And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need-- What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this? Where's it gone? 'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were -- Hey, Nick... Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!! Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks? Get 'em!
