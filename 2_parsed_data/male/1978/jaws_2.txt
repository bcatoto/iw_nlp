Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that  eloquent solo. Now, for that point  in the ceremonies where we formally  dedicate this magnificent resort- hotel complex, a worthwhile addition  to the recreational paradise we call  Amity. Late. ...And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's  Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that  officially opens this luxurious new  hotel... Tina was selected from more than 20  of this island's lovely young ladies in the Miss Amity competition  held every spring, and she'll  represent Amity Island in the Miss  Massachusetts Competition in Worcester  next month. When she cuts this ribbon,  she will be opening our island to  growth, to development, to planned  expansion with full employment for  our thriving community. When are we going out? You and me? You going with Patrick? Listen, Jane -- you want to dance as  soon as we get out of these monkey  suits? Mom, Michael won't talk to me. Shouldn't he be at home? This money tree, you may have noticed,  is made entirely of twenty-dollar  bills, donated by Len Peterson, the  builder of Amity Shores Condominiums,  as a gesture of goodwill towards the  community. $500 as a special gift to  the Amity township scholarship fund... Go ahead, Tina. Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua- Sports, for contributing the special  decorations. And now, the Amity High  School band. Refreshments on the  patio, everyone... Do I have to talk to those two? Hello, hello. It went well, I thought. Very impressive ceremony. Good speech. Thank you, thank you. You know my  son, don't you? The speech was right on the money. Be a love and make sure the bar's  open, will you? Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd  do without her. Me neither. Y'know, Brody -- for the first time  in years it's worth putting money  into this town. All of us thank you, okay? Can I go swimming? No. Find your brother, okay? How old is your cousin? I'm not crazy about blind dates. They're okay, if they got little  white canes and tin cups. What the hell. Did your mom put all this together? Yeah, it's her job. Is she responsible for the punch? No. Good. It's terrible. Great. Michael, Michael, Dad said to find  you. Okay, you did that. Come on, Mikey, come on... Okay, okay. Got to go. Want to dance? Okay. Later? Get a dance yet? Nope. Me neither. Who'd you ask? Tina Wilcox. You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend. Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the  most beautiful girls are the  loneliest. That's a crock of shit. I know. Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn? The mayor? Larry Vaughn Junior? If you see him, tell him I got a six- pack, a blanket, and the Brebner  twins. No class. None at all. I wonder what the Brebner twins are  doing tomorrow night. Can you take a little time out from  your busy schedule to dance with the  old man? Because they're playing our song. May I have this dance? Sorry, I'm all booked up... Come, m'dear. Remember 1959, the Jersey shore? I did, I did. Listen -- what are you doing later? Right. Home it is. You're getting a little big for this. Mmmm. Sean's awake. Good. The milk fell out of the 'frigerator. Okay. Mrs. Silvera? Need a ride? Some people. What's daddy doing? Better yet. Wait a minute... Too late, it's written. Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer. Don't you have any pull with the  chief, here? Better get a sales kit together for  after lunch. I'm taking some prospects  out. Can't we fix it up to get this made  into a green zone or something? Len, pay the two dollars. Tie it off on your left. Your other  left! Good morning! Aren't you off-duty? Till noon. This is on my own time. Hi, Shorty. I'm not short. I'm eleven. Yo! Chief! What? You got a gold-plater drifting in  the main channel. Big cruiser. Whereabouts? Off the Point. No running lights,  just a diver's flag. Want me to run out there? On your own time? Happy to do it. Then check it out. I'll be in the  office. Cast off your bow line. And your  stern line. Spring line... Where to? No place special. Just hanging out. Sailing? Watch your kid brother, huh? Waiting for Andy. I will, I will. I want to go out with you. You need  a crew, don't you? I don't need you. Andy's here. You always go with Andy. How was dive class? Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble- bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is  some weird shit on the bottom of the  ocean. Mostly old garbage. Today we found a  '48 Hudson. Do I have to play with the little  kids? Yeah. Go on, beat it. Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love. I hope that's the cousin. Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky. With the right wind, 15-20 knots. Real fast. Coming up! Gangway, Turkies! We're carrying weight. We'll take your supercargo. Hey, get out of our air! Want a passenger? Way to go! Rich or poor, it's nice to have money. Figure they split? Happens every season -- someone takes  off. Once we had a schooner for a  month while the owners went fox  hunting. This is all there is. If that's it, that's it. I can't watch the news, I can't watch  a ball game, I can't watch movies --  all I hear is that rotten kid with  his rotten radio... "Breaker,  Breaker..." I'll do what I can, but you're talking  about a federal jurisdiction... So call the FBI! Thanks. What else is out there? I'll take the exhibitionist, you  handle the others. Martin, you have got to demand that  Grace Kinney keep her shades down. What about enforcing the "No Parking"  ordinance on Beach Road? In a minute, in a minute -- talk to  Mrs. Prendergast, please... Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney. Her bedroom window faces my oldest  boy's bedroom, and she's teasing  him, dancing around in a towel, or  less... Dancing? Chief... Hendricks. I want to go over your  reports and your Form 908. I never heard of a 908. I just made it up. It means, "Get me  out of there." What the hell's that? Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought  it up from under that abandoned  cruiser. Abandoned? It's a little early in  the season for that. Rich people. Home port is Newport,  Rhode Island. If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as  hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone  in the channel. If you had a $100,000 boat there'd  be an investigation. Grace Kinney is driving my boy to  distraction. Hendricks, get a description of that  dance. Chief Brody? I want to talk to you  about my daughter... she's 15, but  mature for her age... Did you ever see a dolphin? Great! Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play  with the dolphins without skis... Hang on, hang on... Okay, go. Huh? Next week. Faster! Faster! Porpoise! Look! A dolphin! Help! Help! I can't find anyone out here. They  must've gone to the bottom, or drifted  with the current. There should be bodies. Witnesses  say two people; one in the boat, one  skiing. I told you -- nothing here. Try dragging. For how long? Current's moving  everything around, and it's getting  dark. Stay on it. I don't care how long it  takes. 10-4. Oh, yeah. Sure. How much longer? Until we find something. I don't care about the overtime, I'm  hungry. And cold. And most of all,  bored. I think we got something. About damn time. What the hell is it? Here it comes... Oh shit. Drop it. What is it? Power line. Oh, great. It comes here from Cable Junction. Untangle it and let's go -- We don't  need a blackout on the island. Now you're talking. Let's get out of  here before we do find something. It's good with coffee. I want Fruit Loops! Eat Cheerios. You eat Cheerios. I want Fruit Loops. What're you guys doing today? I don't know about him -- I'm going  down to the dock, maybe go sailing. Every day? What else is there to do? You could work out at the beach,  make a few bucks for school. Do I have to? You'll have to make up your own mind  about that. In the den. There's a lot going on. Because, I'm in the middle of a  boating accident, I got only four  regular cops and one secretary, and  a Chief Deputy who is constantly  fiddling with the police boat. He's  another one. Boat nut. What is it about this place  that makes everyone a freak for  boating? I'm going. What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up  old cars? Bartending? Bartending? I'm 17. Okay, not bartending. Why on the  water every day? Because. Look, humor the old man -- just be  careful. I'll be careful. I'll see y'later. Don't go out if it's rough or  anything, huh? We've had a lot of  trouble. Okay, okay. Can I go with you today? You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie.  Okay? All right. I'll be at the office. Bye, Daddy. I'm going to be careful,  all day. Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse. No big thing, we'll see who's out  there, maybe picnic. We got some stuff at the store. Ed  and Tina are going to be there. It's an island, near here, with a  lighthouse. We sometimes hang out  there, you know... Come on back up here! Give me back my hat! Why'd they decide to move? Too hot for those two? I can't believe  it. Maybe by now they are. They're moving pretty fast. As soon as I heard about it, I called  you. This thing is big! After we've looked, we'll talk. This is it. Move back, please... back off...  open it up a little... See? What'd I tell you? Look at that! First things first. From the tip of the snout, please. Length, 22 feet, 8 inches. Come on, let's check the bite radius. The what? Bite radius. You know, the size of  the mouth? The whale's mouth? The Shark's mouth. What shark? The shark that did this. It was a  shark, wasn't it? We don't know that, do we? But that's what we're here to find  out, right? You don't tell me my job, and I won't  tell you about yours, okay? I can't hear you if you're going to  whisper. Can we go now? You stay here a minute. Oh, c'mon. You heard me. I'll be right there. Wait up. Could be a shark. But maybe not. Look, I know a little bit about  sharks. Do you? I know that this was probably a Great  White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan... Carcharadon Carcharias. That's it. Okay, so that's it. Is there one in these waters? What makes you think there might be? Because this big fish has been bitten  by some other big fish... This is a mammal, not a fish. Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want  to know if a Great White Shark did  this. Probably. That's it? Probably? Look, sharks  are attracted by blood, and thrashing  around... And sound. Sound? Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They  home in on irregular sounds, unusual  sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency  vibration. So there's one around here. Not necessarily. These wounds could've  been inflicted 30 miles out to sea,  or more. None of them are immediately  fatal. Currents could've carried the  body 10 miles further. We got a helluva tide this month. Could you just keep that crowd back,  please? Pop... You stay right here. You're going in  with me. I don't want to discuss it. It's either a Great White, or another  killer whale. Can't you tell? Not when it's like this. This animal  has been ashore for 10, 12 hours,  and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's  taken a bite. Look -- can Great White Sharks  communicate? Send out signals, or  something? You know, take revenge,  sense an enemy... Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't  take things personally. Dad, please... No more sailing. You come back with  me, and that's it. Why me? Because I say so. I'll tie up at the town dock, don't  worry, man. Later, bye... I'm showing summer rentals. We got a  helluva season going. We have got to talk, and we have got  to talk alone. We're alone. Larry, I don't know how to say this,  but I think we got a shark problem.  A real one. Are you serious? Of course. Look -- I've got some  missing persons, fatalities, evidence  of a large predator... No one has seen a shark -- no fin,  no bites, nothing. Be realistic. I got a feeling. I have to act on it --  you can understand that, can't you? Of course I can, but can't it wait?  These things cost money, and this  town doesn't have much money. We have to do something. We have done something -- hell, we  damn near went broke putting up a  shark watch tower on the beach --  it's the only one in 2000 miles,  y'know. I know, I know... And I stood by while you told the  people from Ramada and Marriott that  if they put up a hotel they'd need  $800,000 worth of steel net around  their beaches! In New England? We  all lost on that one. It's still a good idea. Martin, when we build up our tax  base a little, you can have everything  you want; right now, the town's broke. Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers... A tragedy. But that was a boating  accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing  but a boating accident. Two of them are still missing! There's always deaths in these waters  that never turn up. Are they all  shark victims? Maybe they are! Bullshit. Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit --  there's a dead whale out there with  bites all over it! What am I, an ass? When you called  me, I called Elkins, and her bosses.  Nothing she saw is proof of anything. Someone has to do something. Don't push it this time. If you do,  it won't turn out the way you want,  I guarantee you that. I've got to get back to work. Come on, give a guy a break. Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa... Hoo! Cold! Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You  bastard. A little closer... Here  y'go... Gotcha! Chief? In here. I missed you at the funeral home.  Santos said you were here. You didn't miss much. Christ, what a  mess. Positive I.D.? The woman passenger on the boat that  blew up. Oh. What about that camera? What camera? That one -- from the wreck. You  brought it up, did you look inside  it? Well, what the hell -- might be  something worth seeing. Take it  somewhere and see if there's film in  it... If there is, develop it! You got it. I know just where to go. Not the drugstore! Of course not, They're closed. Phil  Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me. The drugstore's closed? What the  hell time is it? Nine-thirty, ten maybe. Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close  up, okay? Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long  distance call, very important. Give  them my home phone. Right. For me? Damn. Is Hooper coming to dinner? Not till next year. Oh, hi -- How was dinner? Santos' place. Oww! Nothing. That's what I said. Is there any of  that hand cleaner stuff? Found one of the missing victims  from that boat deal. No. Michael. Yeah? You want to come here a minute? Hi Dad. Hiya yourself. What is it? I got something for you to do  tomorrow. I kind of had plans... Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats. Hey, come on... No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at  the beach, and he's got a job for  you there. You can work until school  starts. He wanted a job, he's got one. I  want to see that boat out of the  water by tomorrow night. Dad, please... Tomorrow night. Out of the water. I know what you're going to say. In the city, it happened all the  time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop,  top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under  the Brooklyn local, old people die  alone in shitty apartments and three  weeks later someone calls the cops  because of the smell and the flies.   Call the cops. What are we, immune? The goddamn smell is always the same. Yeah. I think so. Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake! This is the town beach; the  development naturally has its own  private access, but I wanted you to  see the concession area. Look at  that sand -- like sugar! I'll say hello for you. Hello -- selling some more of the  good life? Your husband's been here all morning.  What's he doing? Your dad got you working? Yeah. I'm helping. You know where your dad is? Up there. Oh, for Christ's sake. And if you have any questions about  recreational possibilities, Ellen  Brody here will be happy to answer  them. Len, can I see you a minute? I think we got a couple of live ones. Brody's riding his tower. Oh, shit. Trim. That's my dad! Wave to my son. How the hell do we get him down from  there? Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get  them back in the bus. He's, ah, watching. A lookout. It's an observation platform. That's  our Chief of Police. He's just  checking it. Normally, it's used for, ah, bird  watching. Nature observation. Weather  measurements, that sort of thing. Ellen, we're running late! The country club has an 18-hole  course, putting greens, and twelve  tennis courts... Out of the water! Everyone out of  the water! Get out of the water! Tell everyone  to get out! Now! Out of the water! Oh, my God... What the hell is he doing? Oh, no! Out of the water! Now! Everyone! No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear! It's bluefish! It's a school of  bluefish! Chief! It's bluefish! What's going on? Fish! Anyone got a net? Someone get me a rod and reel! Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm... Okay, it's all over, go on, it's  over. No trouble... It's all right, everything's all  right... Brody's a good man. Nobody says he isn't. You should've been out there. You  should've seen him waving that gun,  like a maniac. There were shots fired! He thought he had a good reason. That's what I'm saying! How many people were there? Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to  make a buck like anybody else. So? So? So it can't be done like that. The  man's a menace, plain and simple. Look, what am I supposed to do? It's  done, it's over. We have to deal  with the consequences. That's what we're here to do. All right. Let's go into my office,  where we can have a little privacy. I believe we have a quorum, and  informally, I suggest we call this  meeting an executive session and  dispense with minutes... Polly, no calls, please... Okay, okay. Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What  pictures... I'll be right down... I don't know what you did, but that  kid stopped. I haven't heard one  peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for  days. Believe me, it's a pleasure... You said something about a camera. Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought  in this camera, see, from underwater,  and I didn't know how to get it open,  but my brother-in-law, in Montauk,  he works at a hi-fi store, and they  sell cameras, so he... Did you get any pictures? Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny  thing. You can't tell much from the  negatives, I was going to blow 'em  up. Here's a test I did... Oh, Jesus. That boat... Not bad -- that's a real fast lens,  probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion,  though... What else you got? Let's see -- you got a minute? Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around. Okay, okay -- stand over there... That one there. That one... Speak of the devil. Thank God you guys were all together.  I got something for you. Proof! Martin, this is kind of an official  meeting Perfect. Look at this --- Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has  a question only you can answer. What? Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill  in as an interim Chief of Police in  your absence? Temporarily? Uh... sure... The  question's out of left field. Why  are they asking? So Jeff could handle things? He knows  the routine, he has the authority? Yeah. Why? It came up during the meeting. Look -- I just got this from Phil  Fogarty. It was in the camera  belonging to the missing divers. It  proves I was right, all along. I don't know -- what is it? It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus,  it's right there! It's nothing I can see. What are you all, blind? It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills. Is that what it is? You're damn right that's what it is. I'm sorry, I just don't see it. Martin, it could be anything. What the hell does it take to make  sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's  right there in front of you. I know  what a goddamn shark looks like,  I've been through it, don't you  understand? I've seen this sonofabitch  before! What have you seen before? This is  nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Something in  the lens. My ass! Be reasonable, please... Forget it, he won't listen. There is nothing to discuss. Will you listen to this man? Will  you just listen to him? You really caused a panic on a public  beach, you shoot up the place, God  knows who could've been injured --  what if somebody decides to sue us?  That could ruin us. Is that what it is? Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it. Take it out of my  salary. You don't make enough. Maybe I don't make as much money as  some bullshit rip-off artists around  here, but I don't work the same way. What's that supposed to mean? It means I don't like all that grab- ass and heavy breathing with my wife,  it means I know who's out to screw  me here, and it means that I know  something none of you know because  I've been there -- and I don't want  to go through that horror again.  Ever! Martin, could you wait here for a  few minutes while we make up our  minds about something? Go ahead, whatever it's worth. I won't mention his personal attack  on me. I've never seen him like this. And Hendricks is qualified, you heard  that from his own mouth. We made a motion and it was already  seconded. Very well then. It is moved and  seconded that Martin Brody be relieved  of his duties as Chief of Police,  his contract with the township be  terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks  be appointed Acting Chief in the  interim. Those in favor? Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous? I'm sorry, but I respect his  convictions. The motion is carried. Martin? Could you come in please? That's great. That's great too. Gorgeous. You look about 22 years old sitting  there. Like you were doing homework... Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired,  that's all. What'd I say? Then that's what I meant. Fired.  Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen  just made Hendricks the new Chief of  Police. Just like that. No sweat. A blessing in disguise.  Back to the city, you can go to  Bloomingdale's without waiting six  hours for the ferryboat... we're  surrounded by water here, you realize  that? Me, surrounded by water...  Ridiculous. Showed them the photo, showed them  the goddamn Shark, big as life. They  didn't see it. Not like me. Not like  the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped  this li'l picture... He's out there,  somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot  off my big mouth, so they fired me... ...Everybody wants the job. No one  wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine. He can go out there in that  precious boat, and when he looks  whitey in his big mouth he can just  call me. Call me in New York... tell  him to kiss my ass... Fired me! I'm not a hysterical man. I'm  responsible. I know what I saw... I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now,  I'm tired... I can't keep fighting  it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm... Is dad home? I heard something... What's this? That's what I want -- a gaff rig. Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail  schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this --  the Mayan, an Alden schooner. Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at  the town hall. I know. Did he really freak out at the beach? I don't know. Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want  to play pong for money? How was the show? Yech. I'd rather go the lighthouse. Anyone want to go the lighthouse? Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day.  My folks left two cases of beer in  the garage. Is it still there? Nope. Got it in my boat. Why shouldn't I? I thought you might still be painting  the restrooms at the beach. I'm not sure I can. Maybe you and Brooke could come over  to the town beach... That's not it. My dad told me not to  go. No. Great. You're going out. Yeah. You're going sailing. Maybe. Take me. No. I want to go with you! Quiet!  Shhh! Michael... Okay, okay. Close your door. Good morning, America... Turn in the car. Clean my desk,  explain things to our sons, then  maybe get shit-faced and punch your  boss. Don't rush into it -- we may need  the income. Mike left early. Couldn't wait to  make out. Must be a morning man. Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs  an apprentice. If you're beached, why are we doing  this? For practice? Yeah. Then why are we futzing around the  dock? We can make a few bucks working  at the beach. Look -- if you're going to get in  the way, you can just go home. I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in  the way? You're always in the way. Put me down! Put him down in the water. Yeah. Would you take him? You've just made someone very happy. Maybe. I can go out if I want to. You can? Why not? I could give you a dozen good reasons. Shut up. Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind  you. Well, we're pretty crowded, and I  don't know when we're leaving... I've got room. You will? Fan-tas-tic! Well, I don't know... What the hell. For you... I thought you said she was going  with us? Let's just go sailing, okay? Want to talk about it? Want to swim home? Hey! Nicholas! You're supposed to be  in class! Today I'm staying topside. You dive  for me! I'm going for lobster. With butter, if they got any... So long, turkies. Sparky will take you down today. If  everyone's got a buddy, we'll drop. Let's get some dinner. Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us  in! Just like this. The tide's running. It'll take us to  the light. First things first. They'll be there when we get there.  Might even have a fire started. I dunno. We'll think of something. But first, a little juice... Mmmmmm. Anything. Anything. You got it. Coming about... Great day! I think the wind's going  to change... Slowpoke! Slowpoke! Marge is faster! I'm getting new sails, then watch  out. Just a question of modifying  the rigging! How fast is enough? Hang on... You coming up on him? You bet. Hang on... Coming up! Give way! Like hell! We're on the starboard  tack! So's mine. Soon, dark eyes, soon. The tide's turning. We're going to be fighting the  current. Wind's backing around a few points,  too. But of course. Just one minute... What the hell happened? Embolism. Air bubbles in his blood.  Came up too damn fast. Held his  goddamn breath! Easy... He panicked! Something scared him! How'd this happen? Bite reflex, like a spasm. When? Right after, the Kids went out? All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn,  Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all  that whole gang. Yep. Looked like they were headed to  the lighthouse. How long ago? About an hour, maybe two. Let's see -- I came on about eight... Going out. Uh, Chief -- look. You're not Chief  any more. I can't let you take her out. You can't stop me. Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go,  then you can't go. Neither of you  can go. Mike's out there. But I signed for the boat. You're  not authorized any more. Untie that rope. Please. It's my job. Mrs. Brody, please... You're too close. Back off. Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope  there. Let me. Please. What the hell, they can't fire both  of us -- someone's got to be in  charge, right? Which way are we going? Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you  said something about the lighthouse.  Get us there. Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over. Harbor Patrol. Is that you, Brody? Affirmative. Can you get your chopper  airborne? 10-4, in a few minutes. He's down  checking a buoy in the Bay Channel. Get him the hell over to Amity Point,  the old lighthouse. Right now. What for? There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing  that way. Turn them back to port. That's it? That's it. Just do it, all right? 10-4, soon as I can raise him. If they're not at the light, look  for them. I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port! Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the  Kids day-sailing back to port. I  heard you. Patrol out. Hungry? We're going in to eat! Hey! Brody! Want to race? Sure. How about a side bet to make it  interesting? Name it. Loser sails home alone. You're betting what you already got. I don't care. Sure you do -- you win either way. It's a bet. Once around the marker  buoy? That's the pin -- the buoy. Turkeys! Eat wind! Yee-hah! Hey! Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible! Since when? Who's racing? Larry and Mike! If we beat them, they can both go  home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie  can come back in this boat! Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo  a hand going in... Air Patrol to Base. I have visual  contact on the Kids. Going down to  use the loud hailer... This is the Harbor Patrol. Return to  port immediately. Return -- to --  port -- immediately. Your dad must be really pissed. We better go back in. It's not going to be easy. We're fighting wind and current. I  though we'd be out longer, catch the  incoming tide. Putz -- that won't be for hours. I was counting on hours. Return -- to -- port. We're trying, we're trying. Might as well. They're turning around. Are we going back? Make way for the Carrier Enterprise! Make that the Titanic. Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're  turning back. All right, Patrol. Go back to work.  You've wasted enough time. It's not his boat. Anything? Nope... Hold on... Tina! It's okay, it's okay. What's the  matter? Tina? Honey? Hey -- What is it? What's there? I need a hand here... I knew it. I goddamn well told them. Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol. This is Cape Patrol -- what is it,  Brody? I heard you weren't chief  anymore. Skip that. What about those kids out  sailing? It's all okay -- Colby got to them.  They were turning back when he left  'em. He left them? Sure. He's got work to do in Bay  Channel. Get him the hell back there! We got  possible fatalities! Brody out... I'm going out there. Hey -- you can't do that. Mike's out there. Get her in. Get them both in. Where are they? About 10 degrees off your starboard  bow, take a heading leeward of Sand  Island, and lay her north by  northeast... Never mind that shit. Just point. See where Cable Junction is? Look to  the left. The lighthouse. That's it. Got it. Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian! Pump  up this boat! And shave that silly  moustache! England expects every man to do his  duty... You may fire when ready,  Gridley... Damn the torpedoes, full  speed ahead... Oh, shit. Someone pop your balloon? No problem, no problem. You sail your boat, I'll sail mine. Hey, Fetterman -- You got company. Company? The place is a mess... Whoops. Doug's down! Doug! This way! What was that about? So much for the rubber duck. A shark ate my boat. Come on. I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate  my goddamn boat! If he liked your boat, I got some  sneakers he'll love. ...Jeez -- what did that?... A  porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale...  I think he snagged it... I hate to  pop his balloon... (Etc.) Raft up! Raft 'em up! Tie off to your strongest point. Anyone need an extra line? Mike's bleeding! Can you sail? Yeah! We'll take him in! Amity Launch to Patrol Air Unit One.  Harbor Air, where are you? This is Air One. That you, Brody? It's me. Any fix on those Kids? Negative. I'm still down. For Christ's sake, get going! I'm  all alone out here! Brody, I got to switch frequencies,  call my boss. We'll meet you over by  Francis Shoal. Harbor Air out... Where the hell is Francis Shoal? I'm all alone out here. Shit. Anyone know what time it is? 3:30. Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46  p.m. What'd you do? Memorize the tide  tables? I can't help it, it sticks in my  mind. As long as we're drifting, might as  well go with the flow. Not funny. Three knot current? What's after Cable Junction? The Atlantic. Then Ireland. What about the fish? Maybe it's gone. They tend to follow moving things.  Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy. First we got to get there. How're we going to do that floating  on this garbage...? Anyone got another set of sails? Is that big thing still out there? Hey! Over here! Don't everyone jump around! Air One to Base. I have a positive  location on that sailing party.  Disabled and adrift... ...about 3/4 miles west of Cable  Junction, wind and current carrying  them just about due east. I count  ten juveniles. Everyone okay? Any injuries? Can you put us on Cable Junction? I got no room for passengers. How about a tow? Can you rig that? As soon as you get us on the island,  you got to call in. My dad's the  mayor... There's a shark... It's an observation spotter, he  doesn't have the room... Listen. I'm going to give you an  assist to get you on Cable Junction.  Then I'll call in, and get the Coast  Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to  something. Look out! Help! Don't struggle! Sean! Sean! Don't move! Andy! Please help! Help! Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One,  come in. Harbor Air, do you read? Over? Brody? This is Patrol Base. Where the hell is Air One? That's what I'd like to know. Lost  transmission at Cable Junction. Did he raise the Kids? Last transmission said ten juveniles. Yeah? Then what? Then nothing. If you see him, tell  him to switch to an operational  frequency, or give me a status report  yourself. Did you say Cable Junction? That's what he said. When? 1530 hours. Might still be there.  Base out. Sean! Catch the rope! The rope! The rope! He's got to help or it won't work. It's okay, it's okay... Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean. Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me  or I will kick your ass, do you hear  me? We're throwing a rope and you better  catch it, hear? Keep an eye out for that fish. Throw it. Sean! Catch it! Cable Junction's ahead! I don't know. You okay? Can someone help me rig a jury rudder?   We might steer this... By 7:46, when the tide turns around,  we'll be twenty miles out. More,  with this wind. Shut up. I can't stop thinking! Thank Christ. Over here! Yo! I'm coming alongside! Mike? Is that you? Pop. I'm sorry. It's okay. What happened? A shark hit us out there. Mike got knocked over. I passed out, but I'm okay. At least you're safe. What about the  others? Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about  the others? Sean's still out there. What? He wanted to come. It was okay, wasn't  it? It was okay before... The others are ratted together.  Drifting. Which way? With the current. Towards Cable  Junction. Dad, I'm sorry... Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just  stay here. Stay at the lighthouse! Bring her to port a little. That's  it -- steady. I think we're changing course a  little. More to port. It's all the way over. Shit. Are we going to go on the island? I don't know. What the hell, we're steering for  it. The wind drift is lateral. What's that mean? Sideways -- For every yard we go  this way, we also slide sideways  this way... Shit. Shit, shit, shit! Don't! Stop paddling! The Shark. We're hung up on something. Maybe the bottom. Shut up! Just shut Up! Over there! Coming this way! It's Dad! Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us! Back down! We're hung up here. Snagged. Can you get us a line? We got it! Go ahead, slow. Whoa! Come around again! Hang on, hang on -- we got it. You're  on! Dad! Help! Hang on! Dad! Dad! I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay... Can you get a line to me? Get the cable in! Pull! Son of a bitch is stuck! It's killing us! Come on, you bastard, come on, pull.   Pull! Sean! Hang on! Get on the rocks! Swim for it! Lucy! Look out! Help! Hang on! Just hang on! Dad! Help! Daddy! I'm coming! Andy! Use the lights! The lights! Where are you? Chief! Sean! You bastard! Come here, you son-of-a-bitch! Over here! You bastard! Over here Come and get me! Come and get me! Sean? Dad? They made me go with them. Sure they did...
